Changing the appearance of cities is always associated with a change in the model of social relations. Through architecture, you can trace the course of history: victories and defeats, changes in the way of life of people and their key values. This is evidenced by the cities.  Grozny, Volgograd, St. Petersburg, Pskov-absolutely not similar to each other, with different historical fate, however, the author shows in the film the common thing that unites their living space: the temple as an image of the universe. The largest mosque in Europe, Mamayev Kurgan, as a symbol of Victory in the World War, the polytheism of Imperial St. Petersburg, the heavenly city of ancient Pskov. However, any architectural project starts with a master pencil. The architect Andrey Anisimov tells about the exceptional features of these cities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Beginning Was… The Cube","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2390633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ksenia Okhapkina","original_name":"Ksenia Okhapkina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/egPI9f1C278syw3ALCx7A1tk3sX.jpg","credit_id":"60772085fbe36f0078dde8ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
