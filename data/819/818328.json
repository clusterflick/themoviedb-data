The film is based on rare and unique footage of The Seer (Calle de Montsegur) taken by Lars when they first met in 1998, and covers the three years during which Lars was an apprentice to The Seer. We are witnessing The Seer in his element, walking the sacred mountain of Montsegur, and we are with him in his home in Fuengirola in southern Spain, treating patients with distant healing. Some of the footage is filmed with hidden camera, and we are right there with Lars and The Seer, when initiation takes place.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tfQfYVSiMRhyKbgUcVAwkCxUs2U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Seer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3052137,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lars Muhl","original_name":"Lars Muhl","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60770a774d0e8d005a35fbdf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tfQfYVSiMRhyKbgUcVAwkCxUs2U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
