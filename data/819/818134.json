In moraines near Skaftafell Glacier and close to the Arctic Circle at Tröllaskagi peninsula we discover the film’s dynamic cornerstone on our trip through the Highlands. Our guide is botanist Thóra Ellen Thórhallsdóttir, who connects the dots between our experience of the Icelandic nature and the floral diversity of Eggert’s flower paintings.\r Eggert is a conceptual artist with a realistic vision of form and structure, but the imagination is tied to interpretation and his own sense of painting. From his book of sketches, surrounded by a musical ode to Mother Nature, the flora’s perseverance and complexity matches the world of the painting while emphasizing the coexistence of these two worlds.","popularity":0.1449,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just Like a Painting by Eggert Pétursson","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eggert Pétursson","original_name":"Eggert Pétursson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"60762f00b76cbb0079f94480","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Þóra Ellen Þórhallsdóttir","original_name":"Þóra Ellen Þórhallsdóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"60762f11fbe36f004286cce4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gunnlaugur Þór Pálsson","original_name":"Gunnlaugur Þór Pálsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60762f4d19ab5900406153ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051284,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gunnlaugur Þór Pálsson","original_name":"Gunnlaugur Þór Pálsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60762f5c3f48330029733361","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Þóra Ellen Þórhallsdóttir","original_name":"Þóra Ellen Þórhallsdóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60762f671da7a600773d4fac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3050992,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ólafur Rögnvaldsson","original_name":"Ólafur Rögnvaldsson","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60762fc93f48330079678798","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296975,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anna Þóra Steinþórsdóttir","original_name":"Anna Þóra Steinþórsdóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60762fd519ab5900406154b7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051287,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sindri Már Sigfússon","original_name":"Sindri Már Sigfússon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60762ff3b76cbb00593a9faf","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666205,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gunnar Árnason","original_name":"Gunnar Árnason","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607630013f48330029733401","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryndís Sæunn S.
