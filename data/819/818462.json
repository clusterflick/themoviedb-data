On her way, she meets her friend, the actor David La Haye, forced to beg since an accident left him without short-term memory, therefore unable to learn his texts. Alone, without friends or a job, he is very happy to find his old friend, who has some difficult personal decisions to make and who is concerned by the state of his friend's health. As they walk, the two recall good times in their friendship.","popularity":0.2197,"poster_path":"/u8qaiMHYHJUhVKMmaBzE2gdMzeE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"J'espère que tu vas bien","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David La Haye","original_name":"David La Haye","popularity":0.2825,"profile_path":"/gO2EMBJ64CbHNPE90hjktYB3mI0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dave","credit_id":"607765432faf4d002aaf106e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Chantal Perron","original_name":"Marie-Chantal Perron","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":"/zoPe5agUz7OquEwP8wkrEgZv4jR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Minou","credit_id":"6077654dfb83460057923ce6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":207823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Robitaille","original_name":"Richard Robitaille","popularity":0.1129,"profile_path":"/lGds4DrqT7tpmdPy92QTur5zx7f.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Amant de Minou","credit_id":"60776558fbe36f0029a6c716","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David La Haye","original_name":"David La Haye","popularity":0.2825,"profile_path":"/gO2EMBJ64CbHNPE90hjktYB3mI0.jpg","credit_id":"6077657bfbe36f00587876be","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David La Haye","original_name":"David La Haye","popularity":0.2825,"profile_path":"/gO2EMBJ64CbHNPE90hjktYB3mI0.jpg","credit_id":"6077656418864b002cecedc6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3562410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Tremblay","original_name":"Jay Tremblay","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628cfacc209f1812c63cb47e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3562415,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tobie Garceau","original_name":"Tobie Garceau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628cfb286c849271887c0341","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David La Haye","original_name":"David La Haye","popularity":0.2825,"profile_path":"/gO2EMBJ64CbHNPE90hjktYB3mI0.jpg","credit_id":"628cfad97d5db51b2aa7dc2c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3562410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Tremblay","original_name":"Jay Tremblay","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628cfac6209f1812c55a2e41","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3562413,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Renaud Lussier","original_name":"Renaud Lussier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628cfaed7d5db51b2b95a4f5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3562410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Tremblay","original_name":"Jay Tremblay","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628cfa9d2495ab74d97e7e85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2179426","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1430,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u8qaiMHYHJUhVKMmaBzE2gdMzeE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":951}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
