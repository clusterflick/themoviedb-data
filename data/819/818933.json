We explore the spaces she feels the safest, from the chair of Tee Fergus’ tattoo studio, to strolling the streets of Toronto with her friends. Munera’s journey illustrates that self-discovery is an ongoing process, rather than an ultimate destination. Munera’s high-spirited personality and eclectic style easily captures attention and hearts as she expresses the importance of self-awareness through life’s unforeseeable changes.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/v5qTIFnmEtwDzBzMQ65tAFI63Uv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A second chance to be free","title":"With Love From Munera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054078,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yazmeen Kanji","original_name":"Yazmeen Kanji","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078dd6b9f37b00057a447e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/v5qTIFnmEtwDzBzMQ65tAFI63Uv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
