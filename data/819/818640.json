Berger pastis is, of course, completely associated with Jean [Lambert], with our get-togethers, our weekly aperitifs.  L’Heure du Berger is the recreation of Maniquerville. They were both made at the same time. In addition to Jean’s insistent “return” to his house, as his ghost inviting me to make this film, it is perhaps the heaviness of shooting Maniquerville that led me to make this film using such a light and intuitive touch.”","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/8pjIhLXEn12CDpOes2bbqWiJ4eK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L’Heure du Berger","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1756094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Creton","original_name":"Pierre Creton","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/1IhnI1T8LL6dLT0xDQVIZ2ipSj6.jpg","credit_id":"6078246418864b002cedd178","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1501,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8pjIhLXEn12CDpOes2bbqWiJ4eK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1501,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fkI8hwEt9v0NKcQf5weEJGJTU2f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
