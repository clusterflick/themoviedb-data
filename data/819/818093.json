Minorities are rioting in streets across the country. The president, believing that deplorable housing conditions lay at the heart of the violence, is on his third try in two years to push a fair housing bill through Congress. On April 4, a single gunshot rings out in Memphis. One week later, President Johnson gets his bill. Seven Days is an animated collage of 1960s media: TV, newspapers, archive photos, video and radio, that captures what was happening in the streets, behind the doors of Congress, and in the hearts and minds of ordinary people at this watershed moment in history.","popularity":0.0777,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seven Days","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary McPhaim","original_name":"Mary McPhaim","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60760d49310325002a9ab41e","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1136919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Hoover","original_name":"Steve Hoover","popularity":0.18,"profile_path":"/7KgVdhatXlf0IkwZxbxP8b36lhp.jpg","credit_id":"60760d01d8f44e0059ea7223","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary McPhaim","original_name":"Mary McPhaim","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60760d1a7776f000298293c5","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051157,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joseph Feeney","original_name":"Joseph Feeney","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60760dafd8f44e0059ea736a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1543452,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Pope","original_name":"John Pope","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60760dcdb76cbb004199d7da","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandre Lefebvre","original_name":"Alexandre Lefebvre","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60760d0e3f4833005715ab3e","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samm Hodges","original_name":"Samm Hodges","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60760cf819ab59006ed6d62a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samm Hodges","original_name":"Samm Hodges","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60760d2b1b1f3c0040cf0b81","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samm Hodges","original_name":"Samm Hodges","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60760d38310325002a9ab410","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary McPhaim","original_name":"Mary McPhaim","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60760d69d4b9d9007923b03f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3051156,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kathy Dziubek","original_name":"Kathy Dziubek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60760d8f2faf4d002aad508f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3289456","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
