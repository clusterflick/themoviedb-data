What followed was a rivalry that would reap Grand Prix victories, international domination that was a propaganda coup, and provide world fame to its drivers who risked their lives smashing speed records that would stand for 79 years. All under the direct orders of the Fuhrer himself.  This special one-off documentary charts the rise of Nazi Germany’s dominate ‘Silver Arrow’ Grand Prix and Speed Record cars of the 1930’s. Leading motor racing and World War 2 experts James Holland, Richard Williams, Eberhard Reuss and Chris Routledge tell the story of the Nazi funded Auto Union and Mercedes Benz ‘National Racing Cars’. Hitler’s Supercars interweaves the rise of the Third Reich with the racing exploits it funded and what propaganda messages these racing cars where sending.","popularity":0.5391,"poster_path":"/wSX9WOycLILSIL77rr8OXqfu69o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitler's Supercars","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Scarborough","original_name":"Andrew Scarborough","popularity":0.2093,"profile_path":"/9VpcT7q72b3bfTgnq1aUUNoEsID.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"62c4a336f1b5711fe60eef72","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1974156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Holland","original_name":"James Holland","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/wSKwmFGhcqwDdM0ZjMF7RcmPnv5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Author and Presenter","credit_id":"60fa239197fdec002f5a2ea1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2785569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Wiseman","original_name":"James Wiseman","popularity":0.0936,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c4a3769672ed23d095d181","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2785569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Wiseman","original_name":"James Wiseman","popularity":0.0936,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c4a384544c41144acfa146","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt25877288","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4KIk4XM9pqzmRIdHIVhWAf3JKZe.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wSX9WOycLILSIL77rr8OXqfu69o.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
