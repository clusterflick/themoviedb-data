Jabu is an ambitious auteur plagued by demons, who accepts a place on the jury at a film festival in Johannesburg so he can be closer to his young son. He has been clean for months now, and is working on the side as part of the scriptwriting team for the most popular soap in South Africa. All with the aim of becoming the father he previously failed to be. Roxanne is a filmmaker on the verge of her international breakthrough, struggling with an unwanted pregnancy – which in South Africa cannot legally be terminated.","popularity":0.1753,"poster_path":"/twEVhNTXgGok02wGoWLSir4dk7T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2021-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Sotho","iso_639_1":"st","name":""},{"english_name":"Xhosa","iso_639_1":"xh","name":""},{"english_name":"Zulu","iso_639_1":"zu","name":"isiZulu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hotel on the Koppies","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moopi Mothibeli","original_name":"Moopi Mothibeli","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6078dd83d8f44e002a7e21d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zethu Dlomo-Mphahlele","original_name":"Zethu Dlomo-Mphahlele","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8nLO6CWEF4Oswk2KJFP9SjdXSBa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6078dd92746457006e8e9998","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Celeste Khumalo","original_name":"Celeste Khumalo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/jNDLK28BCh15VOBsjj5y00jIjLg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6078dd9d66f2d20057cc6a38","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron Scott","original_name":"Cameron Scott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6078ddab66f2d20057cc6a6a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2792784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Mthiyane","original_name":"Zoe Mthiyane","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6078ddb67776f00029864694","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2762021,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chuanne Blofield","original_name":"Chuanne Blofield","popularity":0.1997,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078dd4329383500404560ea","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054084,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Razaana Arnold","original_name":"Razaana Arnold","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078ddcbfbe36f0078e0440c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1101406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlie Vundla","original_name":"Charlie Vundla","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078dd1c2938350029834f89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1854598,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ziggy Hofmeyr","original_name":"Ziggy Hofmeyr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078dd535b370d003ff4c5d0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1101406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlie Vundla","original_name":"Charlie Vundla","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078ddd69f37b00078d068c8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1101406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charlie Vundla","original_name":"Charlie Vundla","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078dd327776f0006dccbeb7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14708802","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/twEVhNTXgGok02wGoWLSir4dk7T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Prime Video","release_date":"2022-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"st","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2021-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hotele Lerallaneng – clip | IFFR 2021","key":"EomoRe-LW2E","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2021-04-15T19:38:48.000Z","id":"60ab78d605b54900290ad7f7"}]}}}
