Today, his daughter Sana is tracing the path of her silent father, trying to understand what made him the man she knew as a child, through his diaries, as well as various personal and public archives and registries.  As she accompanies Sana in her journey, filmmaker Aliona van der Horst excavates film archives, to find traces of those millions of Soviet soldiers who were caught in the crossfire of fighting between dictators, who were there but were easily left out of the narrative of the global war.","popularity":0.1485,"poster_path":"/fNaGRDBp73CazFvfjRuVnrR7bQ9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Docmakers","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2021-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turn Your Body to the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"My Father's Silence","type":"working"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Поверни свое тело к солнцу","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1295140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aliona van der Horst","original_name":"Aliona van der Horst","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/xheLYA7rGNbmiwXF6T9PBviZI3S.jpg","credit_id":"607702e82a09bc006e4c0782","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168194,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gys Zevenbergen","original_name":"Gys Zevenbergen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607702f14d0e8d005a35ef95","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1295140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aliona van der Horst","original_name":"Aliona van der Horst","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/xheLYA7rGNbmiwXF6T9PBviZI3S.jpg","credit_id":"6077030219ab5900297d2453","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2590659,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ilja Roomans","original_name":"Ilja Roomans","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6180dd924a4bfc006586d41a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1451192,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rogier Timmermans","original_name":"Rogier Timmermans","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6180dd9d8ed03f008df609d1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":54258,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rik Meier","original_name":"Rik Meier","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6180ddabe74146002b6c0ff7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15958598","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fNaGRDBp73CazFvfjRuVnrR7bQ9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1250}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
