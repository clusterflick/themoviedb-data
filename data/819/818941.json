The young high-jumper sticks to the uncompromising training and dietary regime at a sports camp. We soon learn that this is creating an unhealthy situation – to put it mildly. It’s clear from the start that there’s something very wrong in this boy’s life. Not only does he regularly lock himself away to self-harm, or practise leaving a voice-mail for his absent father – the military-style control exercised by his mother, Margot, is absolutely suffocating. Both for Thomas, and for the viewer.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/chE3TI7f5XDYGduuS61ciieKBCC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117,"logo_path":"/twj6GjwWKt23x21fkxItt7v7lEQ.png","name":"Kunsthochschule für Medien Köln","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thomas the High Jumper","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Poerting","original_name":"Max Poerting","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6078e316f6787a0029988e9d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leri Matehha","original_name":"Leri Matehha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078e2daf6787a0029988e59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1847953,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Józefina Gocman-Dicks","original_name":"Józefina Gocman-Dicks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078e3091b1f3c002942cfa6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leri Matehha","original_name":"Leri Matehha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6078e2e818864b007b97107c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14709478","wikidata_id":"Q107077576","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":1300,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/chE3TI7f5XDYGduuS61ciieKBCC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":932}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Internationale Hofer Filmtage","release_date":"2020-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IFFR","release_date":"2021-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Thomas der Hochspringer Teaser","key":"446565872","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2020-08-10T18:35:51.000Z","id":"60ab8761d132d6006eeff72d"}]}}}
