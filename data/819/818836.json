Elsewhere, they dance to inaudible music with their friends, each couple keeping to a rhythm of their own. At times, this depiction of the memories we see one Dom Casmurro commit to paper with a flamboyant pen seems to be an interplay of conflicting emotions – particularly when jealousy raises its head.  Adapted from the Brazilian classic novel 'Dom Casmurro' (1899) by Machado de Assis as an ironic/philosophical essay on poetry and jealousy, and featuring fragments of Bressane’s previous works.","popularity":0.572,"poster_path":"/umsVS6jTPm8XNApIGpKeNQeh1XH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51105,"logo_path":null,"name":"TB
