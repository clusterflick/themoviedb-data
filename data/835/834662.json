The team joins bigfoot researchers like Steve Kulls (\"Monsterquest\") and Paul Bartholomew (Finding Bigfoot, Beast of Whitehall) who lead them on the search for their quarry. The Journey takes a deep look into the subject of bigfoot, but also what spurs people to spend their lives searching for a creature many believe doesn't exist. Along the way, the crew makes a stop in Whitehall, NY, home to an incident involving multiple members of law enforcement claiming to see a bigfoot in a field off a rural road. The crew has multiple unusual experiences during their various night investigations near Lake George, Whitehall, and Western Massachusetts. The Journey unveils some of that evidence.","popularity":0.3484,"poster_path":"/jkdG3VgSKhVxJH6ci9Knf04i29g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100671,"logo_path":"/zU6uHxAsB6vlxwwvY8Il6FpbCds.png","name":"Small Town Monsters","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Trail of Bigfoot: The Journey","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1878464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Breedlove","original_name":"Seth Breedlove","popularity":0.1167,"profile_path":"/xwyEUWG3CXYNVXwhWkifT6h3VJA.jpg","credit_id":"60b1e2c0ac6c79002972c9d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1878464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Breedlove","original_name":"Seth Breedlove","popularity":0.1167,"profile_path":"/xwyEUWG3CXYNVXwhWkifT6h3VJA.jpg","credit_id":"60b1e2b057d3780042824eb4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14584478","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"smltownmonsters","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/icKTkl6JndssSLoOBVViIAE0vV6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1217,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jkdG3VgSKhVxJH6ci9Knf04i29g.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":811},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1220,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zzuADWRn8WZuEEUl63onj3y3eGb.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":813},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2667,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aKV7N05rayyoj9XhAoPZyhGCezo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2597,"name":"bigfoot"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"On the Trail of Bigfoot: The Journey - Trailer (new paranormal Bigfoot documentary film)","key":"ImFz4XcdqFA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-02-02T16:30:11.000Z","id":"60b1e29057d378006f70555b"}]}}}
