Her story stands as an example of the increasing casualisation of university labour and its human consequences.  Filmed during the 2018-2020 UK higher education strikes, #PrecarityStory exposes the little-known reality of the academic precariat and fuels the ongoing public debate on the devastating effects of neoliberal policies —and, now also, Covid-19— in British higher education.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/qjpWUTFRyHOiDMVTrAbqcXPdEKb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Umbracle Cine S.
