Along the way, marks left by those events endure to the present day in this frontier region between the East and the West, a region where now we find new refugees trying to reach Europe, fleeing from the same old conflicts.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":"/8uKFapYgFoB0jRH0U25z9qnmlw9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trieste - Tesalónica","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bru Rovira","original_name":"Bru Rovira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60afee4e5b07140057f13d5c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bru Rovira","original_name":"Bru Rovira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60afee5a8ee49c006dc3ad57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2991149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oriol Rovira","original_name":"Oriol Rovira","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60afee628ee49c0056bdb651","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bru Rovira","original_name":"Bru Rovira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60afee6a51f99a00799f8474","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2991149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oriol Rovira","original_name":"Oriol Rovira","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60afee74568463006db804c1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2991149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oriol Rovira","original_name":"Oriol Rovira","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60afee88ecbde9006d76d050","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8uKFapYgFoB0jRH0U25z9qnmlw9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
