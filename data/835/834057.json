Their game is to transform into anything covered with plush: animals, plants, objects and even concepts as joy, fear or will. In these transformations, they experience characteristics and problems of being each of these things:  How do bats pee in bed? Do volcanoes have a stomach burn? Is joy a thing or a color?  Feeling “on the skin” what it is being “the other”, the characters deal with the notion of otherness and work on issues pertinent to the target audience universe.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Os Pelúcias","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105342,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergio Gambier Campos","original_name":"Sergio Gambier Campos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60afdac08ee49c0029833be5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3105343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vivian Altman Eberhard","original_name":"Vivian Altman Eberhard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60afdace30f79c0040bca548","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
