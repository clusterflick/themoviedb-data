The title also suggests a homage to two of the founders of the moving image. Two friends—Stella, an astronomer, and Lucia, a salesgirl in a lamp store—who know each other only through correspondence, are separated by death. Lucia, the surviving friend, drives off at night, heading for the Belgium of twinkling motorways, searching for her Stella’s angel which should have become Lucia’s guardian angel. With an empty heart, she drives, accompanied by strange light phenomena around her (UFO's? angels?) to find enlightenment around her loss.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ijKnwtxD2Wpz5g34HKMEZjCCGle.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sisters of Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607696,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karen Vanderborght","original_name":"Karen Vanderborght","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626e06e0bf7744009fbd219d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0274862","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ijKnwtxD2Wpz5g34HKMEZjCCGle.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1524}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
