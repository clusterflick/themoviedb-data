It speaks of the forgotten people, their lives and their deeds. These two Archives have been found on the flea market in Zagreb. One is of a famous architect and the other one is of a famous composer. This film ponders on this occurrence, on the vanishing of and forgetfulness of humans.","popularity":0.2346,"poster_path":"/AtDU4MBLItljFPMxTNq57A8HOJJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93152,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kreativni sindikat","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2020-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Events Meant to Be Forgotten","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Scarnell","original_name":"William Scarnell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61a89af3180dea009886ef0d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1952176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marko Tadić","original_name":"Marko Tadić","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b0ee1e945c200079554fcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1952176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marko Tadić","original_name":"Marko Tadić","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61843d25cb6db5008d5331bd","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1301745,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Iva Blašković","original_name":"Iva Blašković","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61843d33c5c1ef002c22eea6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1971422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miro Manojlović","original_name":"Miro Manojlović","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61843d3be54d5d0043af4a70","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550025,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hrvoje Nikšić","original_name":"Hrvoje Nikšić","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61843d47ddd52d0026b654bf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1898621,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ivan Slipčević","original_name":"Ivan Slipčević","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a89b472495ab006553a09c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332476,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mladen Domazet","original_name":"Mladen Domazet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a89b589a64350028abfea7","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332478,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Igor Gubić","original_name":"Igor Gubić","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a89b764a52f8006432eb17","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":260945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vinko Brešan","original_name":"Vinko Brešan","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a89b96875d1a0028fd6363","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1952176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marko Tadić","original_name":"Marko Tadić","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660998834041372001679802","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33298690","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AtDU4MBLItljFPMxTNq57A8HOJJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":41011,"name":"based on song, poem or rhyme"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Animanima","release_date":"2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
