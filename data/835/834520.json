Fast-forward to 2013, the Dominican Republic's Supreme Court stripped the citizenship of anyone with Haitian parents, retroactive to 1929, rendering more than 200,000 people stateless. Elena, the young protagonist of the film, and her family stand to lose their legal residency in the Dominican Republic if they don't manage to get their documents in time. Negotiating a mountain of opaque bureaucratic processes and a racist, hostile society around, Elena becomes the face of the struggle to remain in a country built on the labor of her father and forefathers.","popularity":0.2823,"poster_path":"/o8nz0eCxgbzbkLYg3L0yDj36nov.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155005,"logo_path":null,"name":"In The Cut Films","origin_country":""},{"id":155006,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hispaniola Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":155007,"logo_path":"/6XTX3FjGPMemntv2t9eJhgQ7oVB.png","name":"Rada Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DO","name":"Dominican Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Haitian; Haitian Creole","iso_639_1":"ht","name":""},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elena","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1140437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michèle Stephenson","original_name":"Michèle Stephenson","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/xXQbd8RuIldhBRXcPYTArGlM7Tq.jpg","credit_id":"60b13a2c52dc7f006e16dfcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":565250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Brewster","original_name":"Joe Brewster","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/uHuhW9Ymp5ILpd2N14EkrvJLUoJ.jpg","credit_id":"61268c33a0b690004321210a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15299764","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/o8nz0eCxgbzbkLYg3L0yDj36nov.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sHSIB3UEg5OKdlVCpe2NqrvflxF.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":161316,"name":"social documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Philadelphia Latino Film Festival (online)","release_date":"2021-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BlackStar Film Festival","release_date":"2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
