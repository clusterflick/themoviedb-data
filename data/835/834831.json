On the visual level it consists solely of paused film frames, hard cuts of different lengths. The stunning, rapidly changing images appear like brief impressions of a world that has been brought to its knees by a faceless power. The views of people, places, and objects constantly change. On the sound level, in counterpoint to the staccato of the dystopian flood of images, we hear a warm, calm woman’s voice, lovingly and wistfully addressing one “N.”, who might be a man or a woman, in a continuous flow of words. She refers directly to the images, as if she could see them at the cinematic window as she speaks.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/qSH6QNJzHG71N2U9JJVQxVFT0Ge.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2021-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letters from a Window","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3107794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilkin Beste Cırak","original_name":"Ilkin Beste Cırak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"60b29073a61de1003fbdd0bd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3107791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nigel Gavus","original_name":"Nigel Gavus","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b290264581990058cc819f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3107792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilkin Beste Cırak","original_name":"Ilkin Beste Cırak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b2902dc09e990040280753","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3107791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nigel Gavus","original_name":"Nigel Gavus","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b29038458199004003a293","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3107791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nigel Gavus","original_name":"Nigel Gavus","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b2904cc09e99006f8b4c83","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3107792,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilkin Beste Cırak","original_name":"Ilkin Beste Cırak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b2905ac4904800597087a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":770,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qSH6QNJzHG71N2U9JJVQxVFT0Ge.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":514}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vienna Shorts 2021","release_date":"2021-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
