She had become a lost poet, her literary status mirroring her untimely death. This program documents the brief yet bright “candle” of Millay’s artistic development, from her early years in Maine to her achievements in the literary world of New York, while exploring her celebrity, sexuality, and personal relationships. Among the many eye-opening locations featured in the film is the house in which Millay spent her final years; its contents have remained untouched since the poet’s death and provide a catalyst for the study of her troubled, exuberant life. Never-before-seen archival images and interviews with Millay scholars also enrich the narrative.","popularity":0.3328,"poster_path":"/mcPREj7TABRgjjPi019B7dpFPEi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154972,"logo_path":null,"name":"International Documentary Television Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burning Candles: The Life of Edna St. Vincent Millay","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2588486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edna St. Vincent Millay","original_name":"Edna St. Vincent Millay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself (Archival Footage)","credit_id":"60b06edaf29d660057509f7b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1586614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert A.
