By taking human shape and transforming turnips into dazzling presents, he tries to impress the human, but soon the magic wears off and everything rots away. Distressed, the human canâ€™t handle it and the ghost, left heartbroken, sinks into the ground. However, as time goes by, sprouting from rotting turnip flesh, life begins again. The film ends on a positive note, the ghost reconciliating with nature and finding peace. Count Turnip is a pointed tale about the irritation between human and nature and deals with depressiveness and hopeful resilience.","popularity":0.0673,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Count Turnip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2552450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elenor Kopka","original_name":"Elenor Kopka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b0afb1957e6d002a29ed1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
