This gleefully sinister film is the fifth that Andy directed for Habito and the first produced by Hornet. In it, our redheaded hero dukes it out with a werewolfish cast of flesh-eating rival buyers who are all competing for our hero’s dream home. With morbidly transfixing animations and gory humor, Andy brilliantly delivers on Habito’s tagline: “Hell or Habito.”","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Habito ‘The Climb’","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2708565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Baker","original_name":"Andy Baker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b00c3252dc7f006e15820d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
