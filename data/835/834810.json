Not only did the work done there help defeat the Nazis and win the War, it made a major contribution to the invention and development of the computer and the digital technology which has come to dominate the world. With contributions from historians, technical experts and many of the original people in all roles, from the most fiendishly technical to the most mundane, Station X is brought back to life after more than half a century.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/j7GTruQw5vy53NrTz5a3qtQv6ho.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Station X","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j7GTruQw5vy53NrTz5a3qtQv6ho.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
