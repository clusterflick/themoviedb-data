In this housing complex, where people gather from different places and where many elderly dwell, they began making and distributing CDs on music they remember, also putting on a show as if they were running a radio program, and even forming a band to play along with the rhythm of each singer. This film is a record of these unusual support activities for the disaster-stricken areas, connected by music to transcend the times and the COVID-19 pandemic.","popularity":0.0721,"poster_path":"/hCD2XUFSGNw7qJ9xXDQriiuTMhj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2023-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Radio Shimo-kajiro—The Songs That Led Us Here Today","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061745,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yusuke Fukuhara","original_name":"Yusuke Fukuhara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651dfd01967cc734295ee5e5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1859197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haruka Komori","original_name":"Haruka Komori","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/yzEJFCu2vv6Y59U3w9x3Ab0B2g7.jpg","credit_id":"651dfcd907216600ff37f595","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1859197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haruka Komori","original_name":"Haruka Komori","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/yzEJFCu2vv6Y59U3w9x3Ab0B2g7.jpg","credit_id":"651dfc67c50ad2014dd01d3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1859197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Haruka Komori","original_name":"Haruka Komori","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/yzEJFCu2vv6Y59U3w9x3Ab0B2g7.jpg","credit_id":"651dfce4ea84c700aeec0c0e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1330,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hCD2XUFSGNw7qJ9xXDQriiuTMhj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":886}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
