Roger lives here in a small village. Roger is thirteen and has five brothers and sisters. As the oldest, he is responsible for the daily firewood. To get this, Roger sets off into the mountains every other day. At seven in the morning, they start. A truck takes Roger and his four friends out into the steep, forested slopes above the rice terraces. With them on the back of the truck are the 'scooters', homemade wooden scooters with which the firewood is driven down to the valley. Once they reach the top, they cut down smaller logs, chop them up and pack their scooters full of them. After this strenuous work, the great fun begins. On bumpy paths and at breakneck speed, they make their way back to the village. Races and tricks are part of the fun, of course.","popularity":0.1538,"poster_path":"/s6JFf3dGbbSJdSMqzZKAYCiepuJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87382,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nanuk-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Scooterfahrer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Scooter Boys","type":"Translated Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Weisenborn","original_name":"Christian Weisenborn","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/hjkbTrbsEse4fP75CFwFG2CmRQt.jpg","credit_id":"651ec136a097dc00e36020d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":796,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/s6JFf3dGbbSJdSMqzZKAYCiepuJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6895,"name":"philippines"},{"id":167608,"name":"scooter"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
