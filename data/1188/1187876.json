Largely entering professional practicefollowing the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Fukushima nuclear di-saster, this generation is developing a range of critical, ecological, and social approaches that creatively 'make do' – with limited resources, found  materials, and existing spaces – while seeking appropriate responses to the urgent problems of the present. Turning their backs on the traditional  image of the architect-author, these practitioners are articulating a new architectural agency in working from the periphery, exploiting gaps in the system, and occupying new roles in the process that have previously been overlooked.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/eULSDaE5l0mezhrlsYJi9xGurWE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Make Do With Now : New Directions in Japanese Architecture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4307320,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anne Gross","original_name":"Anne Gross","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b4f8d6eb2d46d8e272f548","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3069555,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sebastian Gross","original_name":"Sebastian Gross","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b4f8e83cd7f1080727f16f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/IpmzlohoKI9bW44zY7ZFahBal7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.753,"height":1593,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eULSDaE5l0mezhrlsYJi9xGurWE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"ALL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul International Architecture Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
