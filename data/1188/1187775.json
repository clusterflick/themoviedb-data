The film highlights the proximity of Algiers to Paris and promotes air travel. The commentary supporting the images highlights the urban dynamism (“Every day, a new skyscraper replaces a wasteland”) and the comparison with Paris (“Algiers is often nicknamed the Paris of North Africa because of its elegance become proverbial). Contemporary architectural achievements are described as the sign of “grandiose modernism”: “we love the new, the bold”. But the point does not forget the buildings illustrating “the Moorish, classic and attractive style”. The description of the Casbah also attempts to understand the architectural organization but also the diversity and even the atmosphere.","popularity":0.8844,"poster_path":"/hDJzfnwlRQxqI3nU94zmOu3mvk5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":210291,"logo_path":null,"name":"Afric Film","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1945-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alger Et Ses Environs","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4306894,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Sarrouy","original_name":"André Sarrouy","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/5cKPM2QYeTBSdWxLPemhtnHJnzS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"651edd815b1240011d7d4fec","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4306898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.R Barth","original_name":"J.R Barth","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651eddf807216600e2d89674","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89086,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mohamed Iguerbouchène","original_name":"Mohamed Iguerbouchène","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":"/jKMAtjtTjGlqddXgV0oxbbdanRr.jpg","credit_id":"651edd605b124000e3d2e967","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4306894,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Sarrouy","original_name":"André Sarrouy","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/5cKPM2QYeTBSdWxLPemhtnHJnzS.jpg","credit_id":"651edd3e07216600e2d89612","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4306895,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Georges Clerc","original_name":"Georges Clerc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651edda6f04d0100e29d76c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2509350","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m8MkqnULBeyuZo2F18KRe1YSKG8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hDJzfnwlRQxqI3nU94zmOu3mvk5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":189126,"name":"north africa"},{"id":204009,"name":"tourism"},{"id":293245,"name":"maghreb"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1945-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1945-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
