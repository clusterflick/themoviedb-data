A daily street verbal brawl is portrayed in a performative act with no beginning nor end. Seems like somebody is about to fight, but they never get to that, or are they? The scene takes place somewhere for a whatever reason, in a cycled loop of gestures and expressions. Some are watching, some others take pictures, while a woman tries to calm the clash down.","popularity":0.6521,"poster_path":"/kGvani61OTj8uDMzsvNWlnhc1pZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dispute","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4306748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inga Lavarini","original_name":"Inga Lavarini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"651ebbc6f04d01011c45c0af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2547793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luciano Spini","original_name":"Luciano Spini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"651ebbcd3d355700ff61de80","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4306750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabrizio Valenti","original_name":"Fabrizio Valenti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"651ebbd274507d00ff9856f5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2480381,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Giuseppe Favale","original_name":"Giuseppe Favale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651ebbe3f04d0100ad1253b9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3603178,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Margherita Freyrie","original_name":"Margherita Freyrie","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651ebbecea84c7014efe8d01","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1808866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giulio Squillacciotti","original_name":"Giulio Squillacciotti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651ebbfa967cc734246953c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4629484,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Beatrice Lebrun","original_name":"Beatrice Lebrun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660bdba66dc507017e556229","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2546274,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Orash Rahnema","original_name":"Orash Rahnema","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660bdbfe149565017dbb16aa","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4629483,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Giorgio Di Salvo","original_name":"Giorgio Di Salvo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660bdb8fe039f1017ce61eb5","department":"Art","job":"Creative Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4629486,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Alice Fantini","original_name":"Alice Fantini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660bdbefa885870162e5d92a","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup & Hair"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1512,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kGvani61OTj8uDMzsvNWlnhc1pZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1008}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":167942,"name":"screaming"},{"id":182414,"name":"traffic"},{"id":279137,"name":"dolly"},{"id":292995,"name":"dispute"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRUSSARDI - The Dispute","key":"483625805","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-11-25T16:17:12.000Z","id":"651ebc4ca097dc00e3601ecc"}]}}}
