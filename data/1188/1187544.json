Already pushing forty but impeccably nimble, he plays suitor to beauteous, heavily daddy-guarded Betty (Betty Walsh) and the duo try their hardest to elope. This is an essentially plotless series of gags but they're good ones, well above the producing Weiss Brothers' average at the time. While \"Poodles\" never quite parlayed his big-top celebrity into screen stardom, he occasionally appeared in movies as late as circus-themed Hollywood spectacular BILLY ROSE'S JUMBO. He passed away five years later in the Catskills, no doubt surrounded by a diehard old-school showbiz community to the end.","popularity":0.0941,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10751,"logo_path":null,"name":"Weiss Brothers Artclass Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Better Behave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":951074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Poodles Hanneford","original_name":"Poodles Hanneford","popularity":0.3686,"profile_path":"/mz6Pz9E1F2EQ6apQVfwtqHRkAVI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Freddie","credit_id":"651e0e7dc50ad2010b0046b6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4305947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Walsh","original_name":"Betty Walsh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Betty","credit_id":"651e0e893d3557013a9e8cc8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Martell","original_name":"Harry Martell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Plain Clothes Al","credit_id":"651e0ea35b1240013c7bd91f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Moore","original_name":"Roger Moore","popularity":0.2084,"profile_path":"/DUAWbhloHHlPLLVSLEN79Na8E2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Officer McNutt","credit_id":"651e0eb70721660139c7a2e3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Goodwins","original_name":"Leslie Goodwins","popularity":0.2818,"profile_path":"/oPBTBFXVdoQrkxfNB4Q3vyQvli9.jpg","credit_id":"651e0e5e8c22c0010364d803","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0495807","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1928-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
