Frank Zappa is one of Mats Öberg's idols. Together with drummer Morgan Ågren, Mats formed the group Zappatetoot early on, which only played Zappa covers. Then when Frank Zappa played in Stockholm in 1988, Mats and Morgon had the opportunity to meet him and also sit in the band. It was the beginning of a continued collaboration which meant that they both got to participate in the projects Zappa's Universe and Zappa at Lincoln Center in 1993.","popularity":0.2869,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":88241,"logo_path":null,"name":"SVT Dokumentär","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1997-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Porridge and kerosene","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mats Öberg","original_name":"Mats Öberg","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"651e55e6072166011c03ab76","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4306186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Egerblad","original_name":"Elisabeth Egerblad","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"651e55f10721660139c7c1a6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4306187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Knutsson","original_name":"Jonas Knutsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"651e560ac50ad200eac0c703","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Zappa","original_name":"Frank Zappa","popularity":0.2467,"profile_path":"/dZiJTFW4cLaqxN7CFuA4NjSMFpi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"651e5612ea84c7014efe6488","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morgan Ågren","original_name":"Morgan Ågren","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"651e56243d355700ff61ada9","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2134788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirsi Nevanti","original_name":"Kirsi Nevanti","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/mFmhzjcmDUFWDbWtiCykTcFitDA.jpg","credit_id":"651e563e2f3b170101bb7196","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2134788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirsi Nevanti","original_name":"Kirsi Nevanti","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/mFmhzjcmDUFWDbWtiCykTcFitDA.jpg","credit_id":"651e56448c22c0012055088d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":589198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mats Öberg","original_name":"Mats Öberg","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651e56505b124001004d6e7d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2541889,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Maria Hammar Turos","original_name":"Maria Hammar Turos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651e565fea84c7014efe64ad","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1153099,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lasse Summanen","original_name":"Lasse Summanen","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651e566d74507d00ac47a018","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29298530","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"","release_date":"1997-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
