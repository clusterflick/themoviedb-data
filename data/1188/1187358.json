In the first part (Thesis), the painter destroys a canvas. By doing that, he affirms that Art can not be really controlled, i.e. when an artist creates, the artistic process can not be fully controlled. In the Antithesis, the first muse negates the Thesis, by gently attaching a flower to a canvas. Finally, in the Synthesis, the conflict is resolved: an (artistic) creative process could be controlled only under certain circumstances, which are revealed by the second muse.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tfWeOYHuo1x5dmjdII0vgKAbZLx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What are the limits of Art?","title":"Wille zur Macht","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4305170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arian Nowbahari","original_name":"Arian Nowbahari","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pjgzZjMHGGaTbzDQPLg5Izdewbm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Painter","credit_id":"651d800d2f3b1700c7d9038d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4305188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiana Kaveh","original_name":"Kiana Kaveh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Muse (Antithesis)","credit_id":"651d8020c50ad2010b0023bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4305189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicoletta Palmieri","original_name":"Nicoletta Palmieri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Muse (Synthesis)","credit_id":"651d8033f04d01011c454af5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4305190,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giacomo Borraccini","original_name":"Giacomo Borraccini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651d808b07216600c568ec90","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4305170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arian Nowbahari","original_name":"Arian Nowbahari","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pjgzZjMHGGaTbzDQPLg5Izdewbm.jpg","credit_id":"651d8098967cc734260b47b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4305170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arian Nowbahari","original_name":"Arian Nowbahari","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pjgzZjMHGGaTbzDQPLg5Izdewbm.jpg","credit_id":"651d80b8c50ad200c91da9b6","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4305191,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anna Giulia Alvandi","original_name":"Anna Giulia Alvandi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651d80ca5b124000c604c46e","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4305170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arian Nowbahari","original_name":"Arian Nowbahari","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pjgzZjMHGGaTbzDQPLg5Izdewbm.jpg","credit_id":"651d80eaea84c700aeebf55c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4305170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arian Nowbahari","original_name":"Arian Nowbahari","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pjgzZjMHGGaTbzDQPLg5Izdewbm.jpg","credit_id":"651d80f7f04d0101394a7172","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4305170,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arian Nowbahari","original_name":"Arian Nowbahari","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/pjgzZjMHGGaTbzDQPLg5Izdewbm.jpg","credit_id":"651d81995b124000e3d26829","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21803154","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":763,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nkF2dQ60qDqyvqMcnJP8MNq2ZlV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1357}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1667,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tfWeOYHuo1x5dmjdII0vgKAbZLx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1110}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
