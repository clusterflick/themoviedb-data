Frank's secret is a burden he bears lightly, but he finds himself increasingly drawn into examining his unworthiness which ultimately horrifies him. Maria, an artist, is his good humoured wife putting a brave face on his neglect. Feeling increasingly emotional and isolated as she approaches middle age, she eventually breaks down admitting her loneliness at Frank's absences. The cathartic point of the film is when Michael, the co-owner of the cottage where they're staying, pays a visit with a woman other than his wife. Not knowing that he has left his wife and has moved in with this other woman, embarrassment and awkwardness increase, straining this social setting. With the illicit couple hot-footing it back to the city, Frank and Maria are left feeling threatened trying to reason the situation, at the midst of which lies Frank's secret.","popularity":0.3822,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11571,"logo_path":"/m8ANv8cvk8RfnYY3Cx3yTGjIAxd.png","name":"Samson Films","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":210226,"logo_path":null,"name":"Early Town Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just in Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerard McSorley","original_name":"Gerard McSorley","popularity":0.1428,"profile_path":"/8lrwOpnfwbNLbBzFvEj0t47aELy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"651dd2a774507d00ff97e999","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances Barber","original_name":"Frances Barber","popularity":1.0021,"profile_path":"/j4vvOB1GPVDqFJYEp56v23CF0CW.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"651dd2b2c50ad200c91dbb82","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael McElhatton","original_name":"Michael McElhatton","popularity":0.6732,"profile_path":"/aPjuV6N10zAJMr55lAIvnpdsNgE.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"651dd2bb8c22c000e6032892","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1244810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilary Reynolds","original_name":"Hilary Reynolds","popularity":0.1363,"profile_path":"/3nv6fuxe6X9kRFmqhHKjOO6en5e.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"651dd2c3a097dc011d03398e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Carney","original_name":"John Carney","popularity":0.3033,"profile_path":"/a85YTkbKqmF0ht2gr5XF652eQIe.jpg","credit_id":"651dd25407216600ff37eeec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":163547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Hall","original_name":"Tom Hall","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/oL9LFZMJTZKvgT8qTLB99Z9iHq0.jpg","credit_id":"651dd260f04d0100e29d056f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Carney","original_name":"John Carney","popularity":0.3033,"profile_path":"/a85YTkbKqmF0ht2gr5XF652eQIe.jpg","credit_id":"651dd26d07216600e2d82522","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45119,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Collins","original_name":"David Collins","popularity":0.1034,"profile_path":"/rXhyMAbYm9av6Ra48Imxr66OjKm.jpg","credit_id":"651dd2833d3557013a9e7745","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1411854,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patrick O'Donoghue","original_name":"Patrick O'Donoghue","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651dd292072166011c0376ee","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":18984,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"J.
