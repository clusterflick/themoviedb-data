Policy dictates that any animal not adopted within 12 nights will be destroyed. Only around 10% of residents will be so lucky as to survive. As they wait, their time in the shelter is fraught with anguish, disease, and only the slimmest possibility of a better life. Executive produced by novelist and filmmaker Giddens Ko (You Are The Apple Of My Eye).","popularity":0.6313,"poster_path":"/eFbdxemqI1szgOpXGnxqZIkoJKi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2013-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twelve Nights","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"十二夜：那些人类教我们的事","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Twelve Nights","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012319,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giddens Ko","original_name":"九把刀","popularity":0.1696,"profile_path":"/hGxjuZeKE6vQxXqPjGRKQ11E2Dt.jpg","credit_id":"534ac9cbc3a3682de4001acf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raye Liu","original_name":"Raye Liu","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/gkxgXcbxemz4WIRByTzmQyeQYhu.jpg","credit_id":"534ac9a7c3a3682dd10019f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2425111,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chou Yi-Hsien","original_name":"周宜賢","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/r6sp5Qw142tLrA3fNA1dpfpoWV4.jpg","credit_id":"5d982110a0be280022f63d63","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4141906","wikidata_id":"Q15929395","facebook_id":"twelvenights","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aOjBgEEkVVLER5thv0iy7G1FPtd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eFbdxemqI1szgOpXGnxqZIkoJKi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9898,"name":"animal rights"},{"id":182204,"name":"animal shelter"},{"id":197940,"name":"stray dog"},{"id":206662,"name":"euthanasia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"IIA","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
