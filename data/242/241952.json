Shot in Pittsburgh, with blurry home movie footage of Santa parades (on one float he sticks out of a giant chimney, on another he stands in the cockpit of a rocket ship). Santa sits in a vinylite Laz-E-Boy as he orders his elves (kids dressed in leotards) around. Features a trip to a department store and endless footage of a large toy train setup.
