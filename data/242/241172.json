Despite his protests that this is money that he earned in the city, the villagers have their doubts. In fact, he held up a gas station and unintentionally killed its attendant, and is in hiding here. Meanwhile, he has married a woman (Mariam Kaba) with a child who left her husband and built a house for her. He is building a bar with his remaining money, but he encounters a situation which makes him believe that he will be exposed to the police, and runs away, leaving a pregnant, very ill wife behind, much to the disgust of the villagers and Samba's own family.","popularity":0.3596,"poster_path":"/if9zY2Owd4tlBKoAFaRzXfSPgaa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78114,"logo_path":null,"name":"Waka
