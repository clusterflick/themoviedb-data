Millions of people celebrate at fan festivals, on party miles, watch the games with friends and acquaintances wherever possible, \"public viewing\" became a hit in this \"Klinsmann summer\". The film by Barbara Lueg and Peter Sydow is a summary of four weeks of the World Cup in Germany. The documentation shows what has happened to the people and country in the last few days and weeks. Between the party zone and fan celebrations, the authors ask about the change in mood in Germany. Is what is happening right now good for us? Where do these new feelings come from and where does this unusual lightness of being of the Germans come from? Is it permanent, or will everything be back to how it was before in four weeks?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Germany: A Country United Under Football","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276199,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Sydow","original_name":"Peter Sydow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eb0c3a36847f82a1939","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276198,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Barbara Lueg","original_name":"Barbara Lueg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eb0c3a36847f82a1933","department":"Writing","job":"Author"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
