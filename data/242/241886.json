After shooting eight people dead, he realizes that nobody seems to care about what he is doing. So he gets onto a TV show with a plan to kill himself live on air. A Filmmaker emerges from this dream, with no mask, gun or dead people. Just a camera in his hand. Then his real troubles begin. Persecuted, paranoid and on the run, the filmmaker becomes confused whether he is still trapped in his dream, or whether Pakistan itself might have lost grip on reality.","popularity":0.2549,"poster_path":"/5vG3cjAHb1PgJORAKiY7S4W7u2l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","name":"Pakistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Urdu","iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anima State","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1749124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omar Khalid Butt","original_name":"Omar Khalid Butt","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/mc3w6TsW5tnsvC2xjnmRKoA3vdh.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5bcaa3b5c3a36840930054ec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2155001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uns Mufti","original_name":"Uns Mufti","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Stranger / Filmmaker","credit_id":"5bcaa41e0e0a265ed5005e14","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2155002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malika Zafar","original_name":"Malika Zafar","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Archetypes of Woman","credit_id":"5bcaa44d0e0a265ec4005a54","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2155003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Mustafa","original_name":"Johnny Mustafa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5bcaa4759251416c0b004e2c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":580649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shahana Khan Khalil","original_name":"Shahana Khan Khalil","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Cameo","credit_id":"5bcaa4d59251416c0b004ea5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":512158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hammad Khan","original_name":"Hammad Khan","popularity":0.097,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ec0c3a36847f82a5c07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3579932","wikidata_id":"Q30632751","facebook_id":"animastate","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"AnimaState"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":975,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5vG3cjAHb1PgJORAKiY7S4W7u2l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":650}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1583,"name":"mass murder"},{"id":7021,"name":"pakistan"},{"id":14676,"name":"series of murders"},{"id":17987,"name":"killing spree"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"South Asian International Film Festival","release_date":"2013-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
