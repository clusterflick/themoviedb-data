The diary records the daily events in the lives of a London clerk, Charles Pooter, his wife Carrie, his son Lupin, and numerous friends and acquaintances, over a period of 15 months. The hapless Victorian diarist records the minutiae of life in the suburbs with a dry wit, sarcasm and mostly misunderstood humour, as he battles with impertinent tradesmen, exasperating friends and his wayward son Lupin's various misdemeanours.","popularity":0.7022,"poster_path":"/yiwNg2YiiIzJGE7jH7CdEM6qxkK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Diary of a Nobody","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Bonneville","original_name":"Hugh Bonneville","popularity":1.0928,"profile_path":"/skbxj8MUuNiI39ZkP38uEirU0bC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Pooter","credit_id":"52fe4eb8c3a36847f82a3db9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":113600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanna White","original_name":"Susanna White","popularity":0.5185,"profile_path":"/clkJ2IVpaJSFIW7ROvURETtykhU.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4eb8c3a36847f82a3dbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1519453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Weedon Grossmith","original_name":"Weedon Grossmith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6116c964310325005e5a4c13","department":"Writing","job":"Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9156,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrew Davies","original_name":"Andrew Davies","popularity":0.4873,"profile_path":"/gOxUTVdqNinS2KQvEyIAMKPKt6s.jpg","credit_id":"57ce1402c3a3680a17004fe9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043448,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Grossmith","original_name":"George Grossmith","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ce1410c3a368599a008d25","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583075,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Murray Ferguson","original_name":"Murray Ferguson","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ab556247051c54beb0b4f1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0944833","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yiwNg2YiiIzJGE7jH7CdEM6qxkK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7VhMCMmCjG5HwF8DVYTW1slUzmW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qBGyCO3GUvX7r4t924kgw2ZclwO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":212,"name":"london, england"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
