Working in a blue-collar factory job, Vince soon finds that he does not have enough money to support himself, let alone his frail recently widowed mother. His sister departs to Cassano to finally end her employment drought by getting a job in the local FIAT factory. Vince is left alone to support his mother.  He gets involved in a heist, and then out of guilt confesses his sin to a close family friend, who suggests he joins the Italian army. In the army Vince meets a new found friend through his training period, and they are soon deployed together to the war torn state of Kosovo in the Former Yugoslavia, where he is exposed to the brutality of war.","popularity":0.2435,"poster_path":"/aelZaAVB5aqFcqm6EAIllDpMzgd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19385,"logo_path":"/uLO7hNXFVCxVcKfHck7IRyNQeAa.png","name":"R&C Produzioni","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2004-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vento di terra","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Vento di Terra","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2073396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincenzo Pacilli","original_name":"Vincenzo Pacilli","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/d8sa6U5WX3Kr489TZjMNGVTggAc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Vincenzo","credit_id":"5b338b0b0e0a2640110180a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2073397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovanna Ribera","original_name":"Giovanna Ribera","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Marina","credit_id":"5b338b130e0a263ff301835e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Giuffrida","original_name":"Francesco Giuffrida","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":"/iqJRYfqeuddXlMhlHiWwN3k9hgI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Luca","credit_id":"5b338b1bc3a3685335017de9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":556730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edoardo Melone","original_name":"Edoardo Melone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Bruno","credit_id":"5b338b23c3a3685335017deb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1871540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincenza Modica","original_name":"Vincenza Modica","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":"/xznKlMpS8Nzali62ykANXTzF2lM.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Antonietta","credit_id":"5b338b299251413c8901569f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":556722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Di Leva","original_name":"Francesco Di Leva","popularity":0.1918,"profile_path":"/xL8SDKg4Jp9ibtn9Mlw4oQVUaK5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Tarantino","credit_id":"5b338b319251413c9b0164ee","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550301,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mario Amura","original_name":"Mario Amura","popularity":0.1364,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606e65940816c7006f5811ef","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincenzo Marra","original_name":"Vincenzo Marra","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eb6c3a36847f82a34ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincenzo Marra","original_name":"Vincenzo Marra","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eb6c3a36847f82a34b1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507955,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luca Benedetti","original_name":"Luca Benedetti","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b338b4a0e0a26401c018d86","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0424536","wikidata_id":"Q3555616","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/aelZaAVB5aqFcqm6EAIllDpMzgd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/gFJIMVjdSjNmL1RQC56xqLlkZFf.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2004-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
