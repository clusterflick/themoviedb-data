Matteo spends the eve of the festival with Lidia and three other boys from the village. The group of kids begins a dangerous game, bringing up obscure mysteries that are rooted in the past of that mountain valley. Matteo thus goes through a sort of initiation, at the end of which he is able to exorcise his fears, but only after becoming uncomfortably conscious of the existence of evil.","popularity":0.2098,"poster_path":"/czB3nodfGkJCKVE75DSBTnMN9V4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2009-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Vallée delle ombre","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teco Celio","original_name":"Teco Celio","popularity":0.235,"profile_path":"/5PUIFW0JvgoaLX1ndyJbSeBdQF0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Don Guido","credit_id":"52fe4eb3c3a36847f82a2415","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Osvárt","original_name":"Andrea Osvárt","popularity":0.2898,"profile_path":"/eisI0LGj3SoyADQ2VOHyLqHNUaT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Giulia","credit_id":"52fe4eb3c3a36847f82a2419","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-François Balmer","original_name":"Jean-François Balmer","popularity":0.1468,"profile_path":"/5CLhlqqDJMjTx8t9ZkAyNwRBzQR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Don Rinaldo","credit_id":"52fe4eb3c3a36847f82a241d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mari Törőcsik","original_name":"Mari Törőcsik","popularity":0.1251,"profile_path":"/dnqtD8vAXDmvxPWrvaPpu5f3ssp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nonna Clara","credit_id":"52fe4eb3c3a36847f82a2421","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milán Vajda","original_name":"Milán Vajda","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/vcU6JE59ioJ6EKfyJhSCqUOQVeM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4eb3c3a36847f82a2425","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2053300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Péter Kokics","original_name":"Péter Kokics","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":"/oniz2V174OsyKs18ByOPZTsI4d9.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5ffbfbfa1c0435003ebfb809","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mihály Györik","original_name":"Mihály Györik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eb3c3a36847f82a242b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1233581","wikidata_id":"Q3824737","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1416,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/czB3nodfGkJCKVE75DSBTnMN9V4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":944}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2009-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
