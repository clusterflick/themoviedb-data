Liosha and his wife Tania are walking through the plush forest around Boldino when a mysterious figure pops up from behind a tree and asks the couple a question on an esoteric point of Pushkin scholarship. From that strange beginning, the man, whose name is Klimov, starts to ease himself into the couple's private space, and trouble ensues. Complementing this story is the festival itself, enactments of Pushkin's works, and emotional debates among the festival-goers over the meaning of his poetry.","popularity":0.1351,"poster_path":"/3bFkTMEiqXcnNN36TwUhyImnzkh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4581,"logo_path":"/p858ADU9O67a7ageVEjsk18jqak.png","name":"Dovzhenko Film Studios","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1986-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guard Me, My Talisman","video":false,"vote_average":3.9,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Khrani Menya, Moy Talisman","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oleg Yankovskiy","original_name":"Олег Янковский","popularity":0.4815,"profile_path":"/4Mw5mEOQKSkpV0zKEGZcfHOYSGL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Алексей Петрович Дмитриев, журналист","credit_id":"52fe4ebac3a36847f82a44c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatyana Drubich","original_name":"Татьяна Друбич","popularity":0.1805,"profile_path":"/t83PuBScvK4lRSXBv7oRTI2yLHN.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Таня, жена Алексея","credit_id":"52fe4ebac3a36847f82a44f1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandr Abdulov","original_name":"Александр Абдулов","popularity":0.3007,"profile_path":"/dYJJte685YHkKZCRXFRatOLVSav.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Анатолий Евгеньевич Климов","credit_id":"52fe4ebac3a36847f82a44c9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandr Zbruev","original_name":"Александр Збруев","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/eLoiTHVqIzD2XbmEfHnOxbQFjo3.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Дмитрий","credit_id":"53b16fa00e0a26597900804e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Adabashyan","original_name":"Александр Адабашьян","popularity":0.2999,"profile_path":"/wbETM3Q6tOuOq6dXrfXkH9rlAAz.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"французский турист","credit_id":"52fe4ebac3a36847f82a44d5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bulat Okudzhava","original_name":"Булат Окуджава","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":"/81XJC0z7Lz5vOQ0qaasusrVugpi.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4ebac3a36847f82a44cd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Kozakov","original_name":"Михаил Козаков","popularity":0.2639,"profile_path":"/mWRsbW2PSq7a19dgZULKdZBpbSp.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4ebac3a36847f82a44d1","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Balayan","original_name":"Roman Balayan","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ebac3a36847f82a44c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82798,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rustam Ibragimbekov","original_name":"Rüstəm İbrahimbəyov","popularity":0.3621,"profile_path":"/uE1G0MBO9NV8hpQPZeW4kl1BUiI.jpg","credit_id":"5b2de6d29251416e0c001c59","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272365,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vilen Kalyuta","original_name":"Vilen Kalyuta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/wdUN98Ct1QxcUArFNW6YIHBEvNk.jpg","credit_id":"67b6fad30c61025fafc3f686","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2793064,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Oleksii Levchenko","original_name":"Oleksii Levchenko","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/iw2yn5F1Bm7CqeOXusLqxUtPgqh.jpg","credit_id":"67b6fb16b3f8fb27c41a022f","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1523209,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vadym Khrapachov","original_name":"Вадим Храпачов","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/eVPfsYktmHa0EOnZViV6VjNLmIf.jpg","credit_id":"67b6fb6eb3f8fb27c41a025e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2894510,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fyodor Glushchenko","original_name":"Федір Глущенко","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b6fcd0b3f8fb27c41a0459","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5258829,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lyudmila Lyubenskaya","original_name":"Lyudmila Lyubenskaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b6fd24e484fc21541a04c3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5258830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"A.
