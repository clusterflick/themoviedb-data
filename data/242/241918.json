Mostly on black space, the figures in blue perform a very compact and jewel-like opera in surreal form, again to Satieâ€™s piano music. Ideally, the film should be projected on a 30\" wide white card sitting on a music stand, center stage of a large auditorium or music hall, with sound from the projector piped into the big speaker system. The film is most effective this way, but can be shown normal-size also","popularity":0.181,"poster_path":"/bvtedJGLXoUPCXgucalzOQzD1VO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carabosse","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":267634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Jordan","original_name":"Lawrence Jordan","popularity":0.2613,"profile_path":"/nELFCK1hpF0pmhRSQy9EdWrVG6R.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ec0c3a36847f82a5e6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2189368","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bvtedJGLXoUPCXgucalzOQzD1VO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9887,"name":"surrealism"},{"id":7507,"name":"collage"},{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
