After Oliver McCall stunned Lennox Lewis in the second round to become WBC Heavyweight Champion, he turned down a $10 million offer from Lewis for an immediate rematch. Instead he agreed to fight 46 year old former WBC, IBF and lineal heavyweight champion Larry Holmes, who was making his fourth attempt at regaining a heavyweight title after losing to Michael Spinks in 1985. Each of his previous three attempts (against Spinks in 1986 in a rematch, against Mike Tyson in 1988, and against Evander Holyfield in 1992) ended in defeat, although he went the distance in two of the three fights.","popularity":0.724,"poster_path":"/q4GIAo5HjbT8yBFIOgEazU3lMve.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oliver McCall vs. Larry Holmes","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1003978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Holmes","original_name":"Larry Holmes","popularity":0.3272,"profile_path":"/iGx231hobBZi54RDjoZfHNJfsQV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64d8185937109700e225946c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4211567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver McCall","original_name":"Oliver McCall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ofYiDvIrxi7AakqTnLEpRSVS1Al.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64d81879b6c2641154f94882","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":155766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sugar Ray Leonard","original_name":"Sugar Ray Leonard","popularity":0.3056,"profile_path":"/mgtPdj3Ov2cd3dMrhuYHcHcuEmA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64d8188ef495ee02924efcdd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Hearns","original_name":"Thomas Hearns","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/eu7F4eikbn0EHBXJZj4eM1BtnMx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64d818a6bf31f201ce690006","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":216149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marvin Hagler","original_name":"Marvin Hagler","popularity":0.2088,"profile_path":"/tnDuXxs6bucrEnVRruFpmjyPDt7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64d818aebf31f201cb6a7079","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mgocNfawRdz4LR2VQTLWn47eTjA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1282}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2020,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q4GIAo5HjbT8yBFIOgEazU3lMve.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1347}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
