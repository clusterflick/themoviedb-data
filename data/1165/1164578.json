They found that the testimony of scientists and the support of public opinion, both here and abroad, were not enough to win their case. The film shows their ordeal and the landmark Sydney trial. Concerns raised included potential conflict-of-interest situations where a government must protect citizens' health while supporting certain kinds of industry; the relative value of the political and judicial processes in mediating social problems; and the need for a public forum for debating environmental issues. The film contains outstanding footage from chemical-industry films of the 1950s and recent material about Vietnam veterans affected by Agent Orange.","popularity":0.338,"poster_path":"/3iXIjXkXA9XKANRNpjmNjtpMWRF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1984-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Herbicide Trials","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neal Livingston","original_name":"Neal Livingston","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/khWAyBqyEkmowQAr8QBOOQUuSSK.jpg","credit_id":"64d91589bf31f201ccbf7bf6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neal Livingston","original_name":"Neal Livingston","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/khWAyBqyEkmowQAr8QBOOQUuSSK.jpg","credit_id":"64d915a2b6c26411595a63a5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neal Livingston","original_name":"Neal Livingston","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/khWAyBqyEkmowQAr8QBOOQUuSSK.jpg","credit_id":"64d915b4001bbd00c6c7bf94","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029204,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kent Martin","original_name":"Kent Martin","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/ezSZ5qCaOu7PfbzgYjY8UVCAe31.jpg","credit_id":"64d915ce001bbd00c6c7bf9f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0226748","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kYOF7tU4wMqYzoct9IgJfPeSqwx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3iXIjXkXA9XKANRNpjmNjtpMWRF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j5PT1Gu6Iokv7k8GQVVqb8CNvwD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":222551,"name":"environmental activist"},{"id":237123,"name":"herbicide"},{"id":240204,"name":"cape breton"},{"id":272851,"name":"environmental documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1984-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
