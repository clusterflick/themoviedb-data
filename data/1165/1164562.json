The film contains stunning landscapes shot in winds of 130 miles per hour.  While there is often serious damage from these Suêtes, roofs blowing off buildings and even homes blowing apart, there is also a good dose of local humour surrounding life under these harsh environmental conditions. Residents from young to more than 90 years old tell their tales of life under these winds.","popularity":0.1677,"poster_path":"/cEHsmC7YA80UA9OuNwhdF5yV4rn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123000,"logo_path":null,"name":"Black River Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":806,"logo_path":"/kcNh09qqR2Pkw1JAzRW4CommrW4.png","name":"Téléfilm Canada","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Suêtes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neal Livingston","original_name":"Neal Livingston","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/khWAyBqyEkmowQAr8QBOOQUuSSK.jpg","credit_id":"64d90d5bbf31f201ce698602","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neal Livingston","original_name":"Neal Livingston","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/khWAyBqyEkmowQAr8QBOOQUuSSK.jpg","credit_id":"64d90d68001bbd01005d10b8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neal Livingston","original_name":"Neal Livingston","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/khWAyBqyEkmowQAr8QBOOQUuSSK.jpg","credit_id":"64d90d7363aad2013ae266fc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wKnKzjd5QF6UBtCQfpjFHpa3DGM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cEHsmC7YA80UA9OuNwhdF5yV4rn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1935,"name":"wind"},{"id":240204,"name":"cape breton"},{"id":303307,"name":"east coast"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
