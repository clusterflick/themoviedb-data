He absorbed all the vices and valor of his homeland. His whole life was connected with his beloved city. He owed his first success to another great Roman - Fellini, and Italian became the only obstacle in his international career. On stage, Alberto Sordi might have seemed uncontrollable and rude, but could have been charming and slightly ridiculous. He played scammers and victims, sweet losers and unsurpassed drunkards with the manners of great comedians. But, even jokingly, he always remained serious.","popularity":0.1717,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":176690,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rai Trade","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RomAmor: Alberto Sordi, from Rome to the whole world","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Римская любовь: Альберто Сорди, от Рима до целого мира","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Sordi","original_name":"Alberto Sordi","popularity":0.5318,"profile_path":"/rJhtlCbXFizYE6yW4GmJND45MX7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d81fabf495ee0294300c58","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31894,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ettore Scola","original_name":"Ettore Scola","popularity":0.2641,"profile_path":"/f4Y5YwFwgvTSGHuYqiAKuvCapI8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d81fb937109700c51ae0b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5812,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Furio Scarpelli","original_name":"Scarpelli","popularity":0.4014,"profile_path":"/f1TCz5Wwff0W3nseJJ15PPm9zGQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d81fc8d100b600ff0b1869","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlo Verdone","original_name":"Carlo Verdone","popularity":0.2409,"profile_path":"/aIjyOzz56M3MGAcHmcwfnztargp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d81fd6069f0e00c7232354","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvio Governi","original_name":"Silvio Governi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d82505b6c2641155f187be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4211645,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claudia Salinetti","original_name":"Claudia Salinetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d824a6001bbd01005c8603","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2601122,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stefano Di Leo","original_name":"Stefano Di Leo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d824dc37109700ffb5d7ba","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1312376,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giancarlo Governi","original_name":"Giancarlo Governi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d82433b6c2641158c7b2a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2814960,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dalia Castel","original_name":"Dalia Castel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d824c2d100b6011c81f6ed","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4211626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roberto di Russo","original_name":"Roberto di Russo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d8205ef14dad00ad4f3a83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Alberto Sordi - De Roma Para o Mundo (Doc.
