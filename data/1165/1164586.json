Most other jurisdictions have put moratoriums on inshore marine oil and gas activity. This documentary tracks this ecological and political controversy, which pits citizens groups against their governments and industry. The Battle At Our Shores looks at citizen activism, governments that ignore democracy, and the fight against corporate globalism at a local level.","popularity":0.7305,"poster_path":"/wnwqjErVTqrifRCUvDfc78Wncct.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":206162,"logo_path":null,"name":"Black River Productions Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Battle At Our Shores","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neal Livingston","original_name":"Neal Livingston","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/khWAyBqyEkmowQAr8QBOOQUuSSK.jpg","credit_id":"64d91a2e37109700c51b7268","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neal Livingston","original_name":"Neal Livingston","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/khWAyBqyEkmowQAr8QBOOQUuSSK.jpg","credit_id":"64d91a3ad100b600ff0ba7e8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neal Livingston","original_name":"Neal Livingston","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/khWAyBqyEkmowQAr8QBOOQUuSSK.jpg","credit_id":"64d91a4f371097011c504b61","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yhkZiNGxj3wLW4SnmqvVW5eJUgc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wnwqjErVTqrifRCUvDfc78Wncct.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":272851,"name":"environmental documentary"},{"id":302100,"name":"oil company"},{"id":310327,"name":"nova scotia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Atlantic Film Festival","release_date":"2001-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"VISION TV","release_date":"2002-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Battle at Our Shores","key":"evGDeseuB9I","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2007-05-07T19:47:33.000Z","id":"64d91bfdb6c26411569cb07e"}]}}}
