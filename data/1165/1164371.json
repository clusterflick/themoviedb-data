A voice speaks, sometimes sings, sometimes fails to say. It is trying to address the points at which various confusions meet and link, in an articulated chain or a ripple. When a discussion of trauma isnâ€™t centred on its origin, the aftermath can play out.  Here, the water facilitates a looking across time, mirrors and windows, as well as gaps and blank spots. A sort of portal, upon which bodily evidence materialises. The voice is sense-making, it maps and unpicks, it looks to teenagers, to suburbia, to middle England, to queer futures, to healing.  COMPLIANCE exists both as a kind of haunting, and as a means of dealing with being haunted.","popularity":0.0648,"poster_path":"/4bJ4JAlWwEfjmPy7x8iQSojXxZj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Compliance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225494,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iona Roisin","original_name":"Iona Roisin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"64d8789bf495ee0294304edb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225494,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iona Roisin","original_name":"Iona Roisin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d878b8069f0e01018fd117","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225494,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iona Roisin","original_name":"Iona Roisin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d878c8bf31f201ce6945b9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225494,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Iona Roisin","original_name":"Iona Roisin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d878dd069f0e00ae669aba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4212072,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Clark","original_name":"Daniel Clark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d878f8bf31f201ca8cb851","department":"Sound","job":"Recording Supervision"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4bJ4JAlWwEfjmPy7x8iQSojXxZj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
