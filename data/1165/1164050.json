Two continuous flute tones gradually move apart, defining a range of tensions as they do so. At the same time, two dancers move through a sequence of static tableau which act as a graphic notation for the film score. In the second sequence, the dancers improvise accelerating gestures, moving ever closer to an abstracted choreography of kinetic shadows and light. The third sequence ties the physical movements of each dancer to a minimal piano score, in which each note or phrase corresponds to a fragmentary gesture or action.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/b6BzRKcGgVVGc6oJYQISMpbHSyp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freefall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3032467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Sercombe","original_name":"Martin Sercombe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d7acce001bbd011d906eb4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b6BzRKcGgVVGc6oJYQISMpbHSyp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
