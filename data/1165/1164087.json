From the Solovki in the north-west to the Kolima in Siberia, from Lenine to Kroutchev, a polar geography is erected into the Gulag system. One does not escape from camps. After ten years of imprisonment, one dies. Some survived, some left traces; they witness: organisation, work and discipline, but also resistance, repression and revolt.","popularity":0.2999,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":169855,"logo_path":"/owxjMUpB2uvfF0sdGrT6gQo2GY4.png","name":"13 Prods","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":220,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gulag","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Gułag","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Гулаг","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3673867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Ostermann","original_name":"Lisa Ostermann","popularity":0.1472,"profile_path":"/p0HqclE1O7wAclh93VilNAsyPRq.jpg","credit_id":"64d7cb8cf14dad013a8c0395","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hélène Chatelain","original_name":"Hélène Chatelain","popularity":0.1127,"profile_path":"/yYOw9tgmpG5PExnlfg728iKKBmJ.jpg","credit_id":"64d7c603f14dad013a8c01d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iosif Pasternak","original_name":"Iosif Pasternak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d7c61237109700ac410b5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iosif Pasternak","original_name":"Iosif Pasternak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d7c8cf001bbd00c6c7058e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hélène Chatelain","original_name":"Hélène Chatelain","popularity":0.1127,"profile_path":"/yYOw9tgmpG5PExnlfg728iKKBmJ.jpg","credit_id":"64d7c61fbf31f201ccbed72a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1590626,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-François Priester","original_name":"Jean-François Priester","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d7c8b3b6c264115753b14a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iosif Pasternak","original_name":"Iosif Pasternak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d7c62db6c2641158c79013","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612782,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jean-Louis Porte","original_name":"Jean-Louis Porte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d7c89c001bbd01005c6227","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0280708","wikidata_id":"Q78521848","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14637,"name":"gulag"},{"id":191543,"name":"stalinism"},{"id":247508,"name":"soviet union history"},{"id":258936,"name":"communism crimes"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2000-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
