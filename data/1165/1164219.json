Stiles was down on his luck working as a telemarketer in Toronto when, one day, he threw out his pre-written script and began speaking to customers in curious character voices inspired by his upbringing in Nova Scotia. That month, Stiles made the most sales of any employee and earned a free DVD player for his efforts. In the following years, Stiles threw caution to the wind, venturing out to local open mic nights — where he developed a substantial cult following — and later publishing a pair of books with Insomniac press.","popularity":0.2841,"poster_path":"/f3JexRDLFTxq4V1EUh2z2fixIZt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magpie Productions Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2007-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Givver Jimmie Givver!","title":"Scouts Are Cancelled","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4211485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Stiles","original_name":"John Stiles","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d80932b6c264115753c2b8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3221604,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John D.
