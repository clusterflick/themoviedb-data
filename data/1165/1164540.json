Through a well edited combination of interview footage and still photographs this film outlines the serious problem that awaits us now that hundreds of thousands of tons of chemical weapons have been disposed of off our coastlines. The exact location of dumps was not always recorded on navigation charts. Sixty years later, containers that were designed to last for fifty years have started to disintegrate, posing substantial danger to both marine life and coastal communities.","popularity":0.3335,"poster_path":"/yf7qmAioctEihawCWDpKRAn30ze.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":123319,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arcadia Content","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2006-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buried at Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Jones","original_name":"Michael Jones","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/dOOESK1rw4mNu53sTYQ3ZwdQE6h.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"64d8fa23001bbd01005d0934","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1261369,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Wesley Chisholm","original_name":"John Wesley Chisholm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d8fa41bf31f201c94efb89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562445,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Allen J Abel","original_name":"Allen J Abel","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d8fa92b6c2641154f9cf2b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6047652","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yf7qmAioctEihawCWDpKRAn30ze.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":163212,"name":"water pollution"},{"id":268126,"name":"chemical weapons"},{"id":321716,"name":"chemical poisoning"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
