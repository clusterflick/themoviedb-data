After Jacob learns that Daisy’s most recent bleach-drinking episode has put her back in the psych hospital, he once again tries to reintegrate her back home upon her release. However, Daisy’s delusional behavior and paranoia soon puts both Jacob and Vivian - as well as Vivian’s 16-month old baby - in jeopardy.  Very Still, Very Quiet seeks to spotlight the constant revolving door families are going through when they try to get their mentally ill loved ones help. By crafting a humanistic film about this struggle, we feel we can help impart a deeper understanding of the complexities of the mental health system, and encourage more conversations regarding holistic models of care for the mentally ill.","popularity":0.0552,"poster_path":"/uN0GufLRbjwBKTRHzZJU2ijiciy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Very Still, Very Quiet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4213054,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Winston Titus Tao","original_name":"Winston Titus Tao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d91feef495ee029430977a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4213053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron John Tao","original_name":"Aaron John Tao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d91fd9371097011c504da0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4213053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron John Tao","original_name":"Aaron John Tao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d91fe063aad200c6fbf8ae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4213054,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Winston Titus Tao","original_name":"Winston Titus Tao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d91fe93710970139453049","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26443431","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uN0GufLRbjwBKTRHzZJU2ijiciy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
