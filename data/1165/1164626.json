The work is a duet and integrates a live web cam feed with AR technology using game design program Unity to overlay digital elements over a performer's body. By mounting the webcam on the performer's chest, the work integrates the human body with technology, forcing the virtual perspective and manipulating the performer's movement. QR code like images cover the other performer, creating a conduit for the virtual manifestations. Featuring satellites, spaceships, celestial bodies and bodies of water the virtual elements reference the effects of bodies in orbit, both artificial and natural. The work highlights the power and presence of unseen technology, by transposing it onto the human body.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orbit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
