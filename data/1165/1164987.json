Even if that means chopping all the trees in Taigasville. The sleepy citizens of the arctic town know nothing of his nefarious actions except for Tic, the dreamy member of the Puffins Impossible team. With his connection to nature, every tree cut leaves him weaker until he's completely sapped of his powers. It's up to his mighty feathered comrades, Didi Damage, Tactik and Mega Pie with the help of Johnny Puff to help Tic regain his strength and confront the diabolical Otto before the last tree falls forever.","popularity":1.0806,"poster_path":"/82JN0OVXODEQv4LBgmh5Kc51nuP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184844,"logo_path":"/gsd7K46hkePQejS6hN6Lc5RqBH1.png","name":"Iervolino & Lady Bacardi Entertainment","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Walrus Who Wanted Too Much","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1276565,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Iervolino","original_name":"Andrea Iervolino","popularity":0.1013,"profile_path":"/fYcOinCNh1HMZIcGkO3TXGj3c1Q.jpg","credit_id":"64da6941001bbd011d91e2d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382251,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Peter Nalli","original_name":"Peter Nalli","popularity":0.1163,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da695df495ee028f6580e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3233481,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adelaide Meloni","original_name":"Adelaide Meloni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da6a6a371097013945e6df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4203932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandro Scaretti","original_name":"Alessandro Scaretti","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64da6a75b77d4b113fc42b4a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27095808","wikidata_id":"Q121437633","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/98MUxnHKKXAd39nXQlzMCKMz1c6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/82JN0OVXODEQv4LBgmh5Kc51nuP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18165,"name":"animals"},{"id":192255,"name":"cartoon walrus"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
