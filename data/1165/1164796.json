The Bhutaneses’ acute environmental awareness has led it to being the only carbon-negative country in the world. To many, the small nation seems like a model for the rest of the world.\r But behind this idyllic façade there lies a more sinister reality. Buddhism is the only religion tolerated by the Wangchuck dynasty who have ruled the country for the last century. This ultra-conservative regime is closely intertwined with the Buddhist faith. The flocks of millionaires and Hollywood stars who arrive in Bhutan to work on their karma can only be accommodated thanks to the toil of terribly paid workers. This film explores the dynasty’s rule while also taking a look at the youthful counterculture movement which has emerged since the country’s exposure to the internet.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/vycS84ZKkk5xSmP06FAyiKQhhAo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129457,"logo_path":"/sjtZGSyiORSOj0PDPseXet8d5Yp.png","name":"Yemaya Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"With its exquisite natural beauty and emphasis on ‘Gross National Happiness’ Bhutan seems like a model for the rest of the world.
