The first, on 12 April, occurred when an overcrowded boat was approached by a large commercial vessel. Less than a week later, on 18 April 2015, a similar incident led to over eight hundred deaths after an overcrowded vessel collided with a cargo ship that had approached to rescue its passengers. Both incidents are in part the result of changing EU policies toward at-sea rescue, particularly the retreat of state rescue operations and a resulting onus on commercial vessels to fill the ‘rescue gap’.","popularity":0.1642,"poster_path":"/hKbhkecNUcqFOgf7QLvT8Ucc3Rv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Forensic Architecture","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death by Rescue: The Lethal Effects of Non-Assistance at Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4520971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Forensic Oceanography","original_name":"Forensic Oceanography","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c1e8259590e30161b1c8f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hKbhkecNUcqFOgf7QLvT8Ucc3Rv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2580,"name":"shipwreck"},{"id":1729,"name":"migration"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"},{"id":208980,"name":"mediterranean sea"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
