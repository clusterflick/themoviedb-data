For years this topic has been debated in the news and in political circles as being a possible future for North America. In recent years, the mood has shifted and a rift is developing between those who want a deeply integrated North American community, and those who wish to retain their national sovereignty. This film takes a look at both sides of the issue by interviewing insiders such as members of the ultra-secretive Bilderberg group, the Trilateral Commission and the Council On Foreign Relations and also journalists and activists such as Luke Rudkowski, Alex Jones and producer Dan Dicks who have been at the heart of this heated debate.","popularity":0.4439,"poster_path":"/1oifNMDzt2Y0Z1xoRwFzx3cbcUt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The whole world is watching.","title":"United We Fall","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Dicks","original_name":"Dan Dicks","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4703c3a368484e0b04f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":191533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bryan Law","original_name":"Bryan Law","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4703c3a368484e0b04f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1705078","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qBZmzWsKmoQfRVgjq9n31O9KeRg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1oifNMDzt2Y0Z1xoRwFzx3cbcUt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/an6yTx7XuhdBec288IaLoely6SP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":593,"name":"globalization"},{"id":11208,"name":"conspiracy theory"},{"id":9309,"name":"elite"},{"id":3681,"name":"economy"},{"id":10865,"name":"new world order"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
