Things get complicated when the vertically-challenged coffin-creepers get their itty-bitty hands on a sword with the blood of the last slain Tall Vampire. With this relic, they can create a super-race of SHAQ-sized Draculas out of any tall human. Now, the half Vampire / half Human, Drexel, is the town's - and the world's - only hope to stop the countryside invasion of the mini-Demons. There are no SHORT fixes to this TALL problem.","popularity":0.4646,"poster_path":"/ffocaVl6gEx6ItAyuEuwX4KltJt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90373,"logo_path":null,"name":"J H Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":90372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Panacea Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Don't look down","title":"Ankle Biters","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Minarovich","original_name":"Adam Minarovich","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/g1oCEy906bzRiZUqwqEscT6EXZ9.jpg","cast_id":1000,"character":"Drexel Vennis","credit_id":"52fe4722c3a368484e0b6b11","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1816905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Moore","original_name":"Michael Moore","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"T-Bone","credit_id":"5918e589925141585204c494","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":544363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Busbee","original_name":"Jeremy Busbee","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Rafe","credit_id":"52fe4722c3a368484e0b6b15","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Fahey","original_name":"Timothy Fahey","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"John Marcus","credit_id":"5918e5a2c3a36842c104d99a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816904,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jim Holcomb","original_name":"Jim Holcomb","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Cowboy","credit_id":"5918e5c092514159c104a0ff","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Arnde","original_name":"Matthew Arnde","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Lurik","credit_id":"5918e5f4c3a36840aa04570a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyrell Petty","original_name":"Tyrell Petty","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1009,"character":"Droz","credit_id":"5918e607925141580d04b7c8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otis Lucky","original_name":"Otis Lucky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1010,"character":"Brody","credit_id":"5918e614c3a368423c04c746","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Minarovich","original_name":"Adam Minarovich","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/g1oCEy906bzRiZUqwqEscT6EXZ9.jpg","credit_id":"573663759251410b24001094","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Minarovich","original_name":"Adam Minarovich","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/g1oCEy906bzRiZUqwqEscT6EXZ9.jpg","credit_id":"5918e550925141061e044abd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816904,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jim Holcomb","original_name":"Jim Holcomb","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5918e545c3a36840aa045686","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0344843","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ffocaVl6gEx6ItAyuEuwX4KltJt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3133,"name":"vampire"},{"id":33873,"name":"little people"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
