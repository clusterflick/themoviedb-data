Set in Paris and taking place over an entire night, the story has a complication in that the trio who want to prevent the suicide do not speak the man's language -- he is Lithuanian and speaks no French. So the protagonists comb the underbelly of a nighttime Paris, looking high and low but mostly low for anyone who speaks Lithuanian. Depending mainly on dialogue for its impact, the verbose drama reveals how the protagonists undergo a transformation as the night wears on.","popularity":0.2181,"poster_path":"/v8NfPZpqJWLQrN6Dqt4mL2OplAM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Contact
