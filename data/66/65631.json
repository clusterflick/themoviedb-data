The two disc set features nearly five hours of material, including a complete master class where Victor, along with bassist/educator Anthony Wellington and six bass students, uses his personal experience and expertise to delve deeper into rarely discussed, yet vitally important, aspects of music making. While traditional music education focuses primarily on developing technique and note-perfect performance, professional musicians like Victor know that there's much more to making music than just playing the right notes. On Groove Workshop, Victor redefines the essential elements of music and demonstrates how to apply them in fresh, creative, musically relevant ways.","popularity":0.0314,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":300,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Victor Wooten: Groove Workshop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
