It was the start of an extraordinary year they spent with the Liberian president as she struggled to take control of a country devastated by years of civil war.  Together with her 'iron ladies' (the finance minister and police chief are also formidable females), she takes a firm hold on the government, trying to root out corruption and spend the tiny annual budget carefully. But it is not an easy task, and everything seems to be against her - even her presidential mansion burns down.
