Urgently taken to a psychiatric hospital, she is diagnosed with the Stendhal Syndrome: a temporary psychological disorder well known to affect tourists who are too vulnerable to the beauty of art work. This disorder which is considered benign doesn't worry the medical staff who asks that she be sent back to her country. Back home, she has to come to terms with a tragedy she has wanted to flee: her mom had gone missing right before her departure. Convinced that she has to move on with her life for her mental sanity, Camille decides that it is time to accept the fact that her mother will never come back. But when she goes to Matane, the last place where her mother had been seen alive, Camille comes across many clues that will propel her into an emotional roller coaster.","popularity":0.5077,"poster_path":"/41FD54ZZFNSEhoCicNDl4xZSyWe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":749,"logo_path":"/8fPzWPPAUrYBa8xr8JCXKrXdVA6.png","name":"Christal
