Overall, those looking for subtlety have come to the wrong place, but for those who've lost their faith in two-chord rock--hold on tight and let the Hives take you on an adrenaline-fueled ride.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/cy0318gXS7gkYpQJA8Qd5o6aZH0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In Concert, In Film, and On Video!","title":"The Hives: Tussles in Brussels","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/61aefvOZSjOLOIAKzUrBJeATvvh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1696,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cy0318gXS7gkYpQJA8Qd5o6aZH0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
