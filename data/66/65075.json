He had no guide, no map, and only the vaguest of instructions: Keep the river on your right. A year later Schneebaum emerged from the jungle…naked, covered in body paint, and a modern-day cannibal.  Titled after Schneebaum’s 1969 cult classic memoir about his formative experiences living in the Amazon, Keep The River On Your Right is the extraordinary stranger-than-fiction story of Schneebaum’s return to the jungle, 45 years after his original visit, to reunite with the very tribesmen he loved and who gave him nightmares for nearly half a century. A deeply affecting and searing portrait, sibling filmmakers Laurie and David Shapiro capture a man in utter conflict, a fearless adventurer, and one of the most charming, enigmatic, and perplexing men ever captured on screen.","popularity":0.4527,"poster_path":"/547BjvhpThD8QXpGB7UnKi33ox2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keep the River on Your Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":18,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Krata to potami dexia","type":"Festical title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Once I Was a Cannibal","type":"working title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Wild Man","type":"working title"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Keep the River on Your Right","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1061895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tobias Schneebaum","original_name":"Tobias Schneebaum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe46fbc3a368484e0aeaf9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Mailer","original_name":"Norman Mailer","popularity":0.3322,"profile_path":"/k3WaFdSl9OAi1BjFO4h4RniEjeL.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe46fbc3a368484e0aeafd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1061896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Nelson Rockefeller","original_name":"Michael Nelson Rockefeller","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe46fbc3a368484e0aeb01","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":240363,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laurie Gwen Shapiro","original_name":"Laurie Gwen Shapiro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fPtAyy8Ir2RaTvMdmiNYNvxqadc.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46fbc3a368484e0aeaf5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458224,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Shapiro","original_name":"David Shapiro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5666924d92514129c2000539","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0206187","wikidata_id":"Q21869488","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/547BjvhpThD8QXpGB7UnKi33ox2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oHR0KPt0RE74iy3WyGPEmfLPbJM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sNA1bkeEnhGMpFitfh1LbFGPOJW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10428,"name":"cultural difference"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Keep the River on Your Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale 2000 Trailer | Documentary","key":"Qfnxcvs39JM","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-07-20T00:39:22.000Z","id":"66538ec0d4ef6ffc40057621"}]}}}
