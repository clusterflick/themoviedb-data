Venturing deep into the Northern Minnesota wilderness for a quiet getaway with their father and step- mother, two grown siblings realize that something is terribly wrong when the family dog is brutally killed. Shortly thereafter, a wild-eyed man emerges from the woods and claims that he will fight to protect the family from the horrible menace lurking in the dark. As tensions rise and trust erodes, the only thing more deadly than what lurks outside becomes the growing dread within.","popularity":0.225,"poster_path":"/mZnf9KpeWXdW9UkpdeEQ0fuGMcN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18656,"logo_path":"/39IXbSAetEdkeTMrU3GrTAybbk0.png","name":"Breaking Glass Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dawning","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Najarra Townsend","original_name":"Najarra Townsend","popularity":0.3082,"profile_path":"/9XCcoiea3wOTwzdclR1O9BKNU48.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Aurora","credit_id":"57f721c0c3a3687c72001bfd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1690467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Goslow","original_name":"Jonas Goslow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Chris","credit_id":"57f721d292514111c7001bbc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1690468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Coral","original_name":"David Coral","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Richard","credit_id":"57f721e292514111c9001b83","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Kellogg-Darrin","original_name":"Christine Kellogg-Darrin","popularity":0.1354,"profile_path":"/8I9UawqSRfdsj9OntIPJhO1bOdU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Laura","credit_id":"57f721f192514111c5001c8d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1690469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Jay Salmen","original_name":"Daniel Jay Salmen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Man","credit_id":"57f7220092514111d1001cd6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2689353,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Brian Clement","original_name":"Brian Clement","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657ab482ec8a4300c33b2e38","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629897,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gregg Holtgrewe","original_name":"Gregg Holtgrewe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f720d692514111c5001c3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1629897,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gregg Holtgrewe","original_name":"Gregg Holtgrewe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f7210392514111d4001ba6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1530660","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3TiSe2BDLQvJMos3Jw4XVqfZsSY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mZnf9KpeWXdW9UkpdeEQ0fuGMcN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1360,"name":"minnesota"},{"id":13209,"name":"cabin in the woods"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
