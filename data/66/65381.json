With Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke from the original outfit and guitarist David \"Bucket\" Colwell, now a member of more than 10 years' standing, they're supremely tight, running through a succession of hits like \"Can't Get Enough,\" \"Feel Like Makin' Love,\" \"Burnin' Sky,\" \"Rock and Roll Fantasy,\" and Free's immortal \"All Right Now.\" Mostly, the songs are well-honed and urgent, free from indulgent solos, but Rodgers--whose voice has always been Bad Company's main attraction--leaves too many choruses to the crowd.","popularity":0.1359,"poster_path":"/qUqqMeEsfSR7eatOpXz5EMC5CsC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"17 tracks recorded live at the Paramount Theatre in Denver","title":"Bad Company in Concert: Merchants of Cool","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k3DTc4mpfnJ5rra2vzD8iBFLPXb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qUqqMeEsfSR7eatOpXz5EMC5CsC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.73,"height":777,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/wgAKRE77SSbcJ7Y5e76OzVdOHNI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":567}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18002,"name":"hard rock"},{"id":196067,"name":"blues rock"},{"id":289911,"name":"bad company"},{"id":339059,"name":"british rock group"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
