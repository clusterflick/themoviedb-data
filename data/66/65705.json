The eccentric artist eventually tolerates the intrusions of the two teens and gives the boy some historical background on how the two met and became involved. When the boy tells his mother he has met the artist, the mother returns to him and rekindles the passionate affair the two shared years before. The boy is caught in the middle between his mother's infidelity and his own resentment and rebellion towards his conservative, often humorless father.","popularity":0.0532,"poster_path":"/dvDWxr5y721YL0ZtXLnktrOpRFG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Only Son","video":false,"vote_average":4.75,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":543933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Ancian","original_name":"Eric Ancian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Eric","credit_id":"52fe4717c3a368484e0b46f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":543934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Bouvet","original_name":"Francis Bouvet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Le père","credit_id":"52fe4717c3a368484e0b46f5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":543935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eléanor Farouel","original_name":"Eléanor Farouel","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Florence","credit_id":"52fe4717c3a368484e0b46f9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":543936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Hureau","original_name":"Serge Hureau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1004,"character":"Serge","credit_id":"52fe4717c3a368484e0b46fd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4654210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Schoeller","original_name":"Guy Schoeller","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"","credit_id":"661d3885ec0c580163743710","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4654211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Vanier-Baulier","original_name":"Paul Vanier-Baulier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"","credit_id":"661d388d6f43ec01875d8f7f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":376323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Polac","original_name":"Michel Polac","popularity":0.1189,"profile_path":"/xQzRBqLqLlbzQ1mY1CCuMsAA2K9.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4717c3a368484e0b46ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":376323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Polac","original_name":"Michel Polac","popularity":0.1189,"profile_path":"/xQzRBqLqLlbzQ1mY1CCuMsAA2K9.jpg","credit_id":"661d386a4ca67601871cd2e0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0191608","wikidata_id":"Q16681740","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dvDWxr5y721YL0ZtXLnktrOpRFG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
