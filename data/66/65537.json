The clever man has worked out a scheme to snare rich men. The trick is simple: \"Pantoufle\", the little dog he lets for 5,000 francs a week, will run off, climb into a luxurious car with only one man inside and \"retrieve\" him to Josyane, since her address is stuck to the dog's collar. René, the first man who rings her door-bell, is single (or nearly so!), good-looking but ... broke.","popularity":0.3117,"poster_path":"/9EVXbk9DizNGDrEmfXyVx7AH2xp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104908,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinéa
