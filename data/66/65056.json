In other words, it's a movie for everyone, period. Set in suburban Long Island in the summer of 2002, with the psychic wounds of 9/11 still fresh, A Little Help is a story that takes a comic, searching and profoundly empathetic look at a few pivotal months in the life of dental hygienist Laura Pehlke (Jenna Fischer)-an ordinary woman whose life suddenly flies off the rails-and her heroic efforts to re-establish a sense of security and normalcy for herself and her son.","popularity":3.5347,"poster_path":"/dz5Dtx02nATmBskqAp1m8YJgSVR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62764,"logo_path":null,"name":"Secret Handshake
