Later, the executive's body is brought to company offices for an official wake -- only no one at the company has ordered that such a thing be done. A mysterious prankster, who is able to imitate the voice of the company's president, has arranged these things. When Americans from the head office get wind of these developments, they institute a search for the perpetrator which leads to mysterious subterranean passages under the company's skyscraper.","popularity":0.7228,"poster_path":"/3EfiJ9YJSexXkxYw8giytLN2vjt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1530,"logo_path":null,"name":"Citel
