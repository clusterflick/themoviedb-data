Within the shadows of their mysterious surroundings, they discover millions in loot, seemingly left behind in filthy duffel bags for no good reasons. That was not all they would uncover – for two rotting corpses and a loaded gun were next to be found. Already sickly, Fatia experiences strange recollections and trauma in the form of a strange young girl and as well, that of a sinister presence – all clues that point towards an evil that occurred within this dilapidated structure some time ago. Things take a turn for the worse when the gun goes missing, their friendship self-destructs and Fatia’s haunting escalate to a point where she teeters on the brink of sanity.","popularity":0.1044,"poster_path":"/yCS5KQ14MqLSuFliZwNfneGtzko.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2011-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No Way Out","title":"No Entry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","title":"Di Larang Masuk","type":"Movie"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asyikin Kamal","original_name":"Asyikin Kamal","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Fatia","credit_id":"550f6d57c3a3683f39003c6d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1444222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muhamad Ismaizal bin Yusoof","original_name":"Muhamad Ismaizal bin Yusoof","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ronnie","credit_id":"550f6d6a925141065c003cee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isma Hanum","original_name":"Isma Hanum","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Juli","credit_id":"550f6d82c3a3681db200a6e5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muniff Isa","original_name":"Muniff Isa","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bad","credit_id":"550f6d949251410701003d36","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4289274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Chiang Hoi-Si","original_name":"Jeffrey Chiang Hoi-Si","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6510ca03344a8e0972cd8a4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yCS5KQ14MqLSuFliZwNfneGtzko.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
