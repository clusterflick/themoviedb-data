It is an historic running through the technical and artistic evolution of the 7th art. We move from mute to sound, from B&amp;W to color, trough all the genders (musical, Lyric, politic...). Beside it we have a kind of resume of the historic contest in which cinema lived till now, events and movements (neo-realism, classical etc.). All the aspects are taken in consideration: fashion, star system till the end, the sad end, of cinema in the theaters.","popularity":0.2983,"poster_path":"/vrnz1zvIMgKZKRfgQt7NGql6v79.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20849,"logo_path":null,"name":"Audifilm","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":26803,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salomé","origin_country":""},{"id":75001,"logo_path":null,"name":"ASP","origin_country":""},{"id":850,"logo_path":"/aF7qajGJGtMpdrtvssM9g90YanX.png","name":"Eurimages","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":6744,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magyar Televízió Müvelödési Föszerkesztöség (MTV)","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1997-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nitrate Base","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1844011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucianna De Falco","original_name":"Lucianna De Falco","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":"/hUOpHDgmCp1ID6xLUptOvAHXBc3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d8e664a8289a00029cc83de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iaia Forte","original_name":"Iaia Forte","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":"/xJPwCODM1Onk0iSeffseIpUBe0k.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d8e66608289a0000fcc9069","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Éric Berger","original_name":"Éric Berger","popularity":0.095,"profile_path":"/6oeq8mv2um0a1V87U09i1CtmBh2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d8e66e1221ba60021b5c96f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabio De Luigi","original_name":"Fabio De Luigi","popularity":0.5012,"profile_path":"/9NhWezlcSxu6cYHH5kU4EklfozC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5d8e66f6109cd00029411e1b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dario Costa","original_name":"Dario Costa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bbZ4kdtylkNrIatq4w5daDU0abX.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"6230899563aad200731efd88","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Ferreri","original_name":"Marco Ferreri","popularity":0.1958,"profile_path":"/afP3Hk6ys05jqh33q8nrmkELpZz.jpg","credit_id":"537578a00e0a2630430009d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203489,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jean-Jacques Prunès","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Prunès","popularity":0.1521,"profile_path":"/hYfhcK2XT0htTpHI6V5AdXXqYMn.jpg","credit_id":"5d9a73bdd371970018b6e6ed","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1013552,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Tibor Lázár","original_name":"Tibor Lázár","popularity":0.1116,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb26aa1089ba00450e72b4","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Ferreri","original_name":"Marco Ferreri","popularity":0.1958,"profile_path":"/afP3Hk6ys05jqh33q8nrmkELpZz.jpg","credit_id":"5fbb26921089ba00400e4ebe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679760,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lóránd Banner-Szûcs","original_name":"Lóránd Banner-Szûcs","popularity":0.0497,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb26d004b5960042f75603","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1602701,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"László Makai","original_name":"László Makai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fbb26ba8de0ae00414ceb27","department":"Art","job":"Set Decoration"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158358,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dominique B.
