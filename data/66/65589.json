From the comfort of your seat, you'll thrill to the larger-than-life vista of raging waters as you take a heart-pounding ride over the Falls and experience other death-defying stunts performed there.  Meet the daredevils who challenged the fury of the Falls: The Great Blondin, who completed a death-defying tightrope walk over the river in 1860; and Annie Taylor, a 63 year-old teacher who was the first person to go over in a barrel and live to tell the story.  Created by Academy Award winner Kieth Merrill, the film takes you back to before the first Europeans discovered the Falls and gives you a glimpse of their 12,000 year history. No trip to the Falls is complete until you've seen Niagara: Miracles, Myths and Magic.","popularity":0.1248,"poster_path":"/wly8WLgg8Uyo5SOqJfhx1s1mbTi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Niagara - Miracles Myths and Magic","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75590,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kieth Merrill","original_name":"Kieth Merrill","popularity":0.1153,"profile_path":"/9p3ZA9eHRmqUbVmYSlHbtG165BA.jpg","credit_id":"5413fdde0e0a2619a4001363","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75590,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kieth Merrill","original_name":"Kieth Merrill","popularity":0.1153,"profile_path":"/9p3ZA9eHRmqUbVmYSlHbtG165BA.jpg","credit_id":"5413fe04c3a3687db6001391","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0091626","wikidata_id":"Q16977126","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cNsb8erIVNEj6lN8wLEujYur9sx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":630},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wly8WLgg8Uyo5SOqJfhx1s1mbTi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
