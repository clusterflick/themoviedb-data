It provides a multi-perspective view of a tumultuous period as seen through the eyes—and reflected in the hearts and minds—of members of the high-school generation that was born around the time of the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, and that came of age in the 1960s. Others join them in creating in the film’s conversation about the period and the psycho-emotional topography of high-Maoist China, as well as the enduring legacy of that period.","popularity":0.7854,"poster_path":"/ygkq8wUooDBFlhw69B9asXTh1xp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Morning Sun","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carma Hinton","original_name":"Carma Hinton","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46fbc3a368484e0aeb1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geramie Barmé","original_name":"Geramie Barmé","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46fbc3a368484e0aeb15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Gordon","original_name":"Richard Gordon","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46fbc3a368484e0aeb0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0381430","wikidata_id":"Q6912901","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2OFXFo61qoL7w9wlMLNrNNfJMka.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.72,"height":1083,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ygkq8wUooDBFlhw69B9asXTh1xp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4004,"name":"cultural revolution"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
