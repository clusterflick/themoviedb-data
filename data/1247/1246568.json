The prevailing question for the characters is whether to ‘lean in’ or to resist through strategies of withdrawal, redaction, and retreat. The curriculum is complicated by scenes drawn from the 1954 film Salt of the Earth, a semi-fictional account of a strike at a New Mexico zinc mine wherein the status of the women’s domestic labor is viewed through the strike’s racial and economic urgencies. The group is drawn into this contestation by the film’s soundtrack and a woman attempting to escape becoming its protagonist. Ambiguous labor leaks between the nine characters as they confront the social instruments for the expression of complaint, anger, and suffering. Some learn to feign surprise and incompetence and to conspicuously demonstrate fatigue.","popularity":0.1436,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Startled Faction (a sensitivity training)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2462144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carrie Louise Abernathy","original_name":"Carrie Louise Abernathy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Priestx 3","credit_id":"65d1b4e9c144dd017cbeaad3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4543281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Democco Atcher","original_name":"Democco Atcher","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Male Mystic","credit_id":"65d1b50541eee1017c0952ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3030517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Crotte","original_name":"Laura Crotte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jodie","credit_id":"65d1b527db72c0016339002f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2334454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coco Elysses","original_name":"Coco Elysses","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Priestx 1","credit_id":"65d1b53dc144dd017cbeab32","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1251820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Garvey","original_name":"Michael Garvey","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/eZoWourYVk79JpPx4l9yaIse8gs.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Becomingmystic 1","credit_id":"65d1b5aea0664501861a1867","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4543290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zachary Nicol","original_name":"Zachary Nicol","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Becomingmystic 3","credit_id":"65d1b5d1db72c0016339007c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4543292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beata Pilch","original_name":"Beata Pilch","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Female Mystic","credit_id":"65d1b5e31685da017ac4377d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4543293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristal Sabbagh","original_name":"Cristal Sabbagh","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Becomingmystic 2","credit_id":"65d1b5f566751d018631ea38","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4543296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristin Van Loon","original_name":"Kristin Van Loon","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Priestx 2","credit_id":"65d1b6096eecee018a38b82f","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4543298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Sullivan","original_name":"Catherine Sullivan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d1b63ddb72c000c8387f5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3546769,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Raoul Germain","original_name":"Raoul Germain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d1b672aa659e016242d78c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE STARTLED FACTION trailer | BFI London Film Festival 2018","key":"Nr3aCu-3iMk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2018-10-16T13:32:25.000Z","id":"65d1b6c641eee100e7086419"}]}}}
