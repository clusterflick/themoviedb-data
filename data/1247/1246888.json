A number of factors complicate the case: the suspect was without a driver's license; he reported the car stolen to cover himself; he could not be persuaded to confess; and the girlfriend is pregnant. The police use considerable pressure on the girl, and treat her eventual statement as though it were a confession.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Investigation of a Hit and Run","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Marshall","original_name":"John Marshall","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/aN1Rt8npcoqDNiQsnz8Iis0WYCN.jpg","credit_id":"65d297824bc38b01575446f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12805132","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
