We tried to perform and make a trash violence sex movie in the tradition of the Kuchar brothers or film noir. The girl is Georgia Sulla Tella, the man a real police cop we asked for the role for the bad guy playing in the red-light area of Frankfurt. He was happy to play a bad boy and he is real good. The music is \"Sleepwalk\" and the drums from a Pink Floyd record. I shot the film and edited it later on my own. The apartment was the one I was living with Georgia, it was our real outfit. She always wore this kind of stuff, you know all the good girls were wild.","popularity":0.0607,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sleepwalk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2609144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anja Czioska","original_name":"Anja Czioska","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d141ef6eecee018a37f272","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
