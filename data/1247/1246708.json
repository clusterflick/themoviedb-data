And then again: hay in the barn, pitchforks in the field, potatoes and sour milk. The even rhythm of nature and the rhythm of human work and human life inscribed in it. A life in common.

A warm, intimate portrait of two old people.","popularity":0.0814,"poster_path":"/vZSYN6Gzg7n38fU7quzKXLAhmXt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dziad i baba","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Grandpa and Grandma","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomasz Zygadło","original_name":"Tomasz Zygadło","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/490Tf6dr8NSowHwXla0OylCJJXk.jpg","credit_id":"65d22a53f9475b0186db21b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0176681","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1426,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vZSYN6Gzg7n38fU7quzKXLAhmXt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":950}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
