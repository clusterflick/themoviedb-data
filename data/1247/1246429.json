You see them at home; the way they live, the way they bathe and shower. It's also about my life. Six short portraits on the way I approach my friends. What they say is not that important, as these are private conversations in a relaxed atmosphere. The music in the film is that of my friends or groups. The two members of my girl band The 3 Pussy Kisses are also part of the film with a long song that I sing, Oh What a Wonderful World. Manfred, Martina, Hans, Andrea, Birgit, Matthias are the stars.","popularity":0.0691,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Friends in Frankfurt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2609144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anja Czioska","original_name":"Anja Czioska","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d14899aa659e016242799f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
