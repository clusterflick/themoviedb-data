I am particularly interested in the tipping points at which curiosity and the associated openness to the unknown turn into an urge for control. The title Drawing from Nature refers to the artistic practice of nature study. It is a way of visually and mentally appropriating what is observed, which subsequently allows one to freely dispose of the representation of the motif. I make use of this principle in my work. In my studies of nature, however, I try to include both the motif and the observer himself. My specific interest here is in the area between the two poles, the area of tension in which the weighting of open-mindedness and dominance is decided.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drawing from Nature (Episode 3)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2643693,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Heindl","original_name":"Michael Heindl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d0f61a8eda87018547678c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Deluge Online Exhibition","release_date":"2024-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
