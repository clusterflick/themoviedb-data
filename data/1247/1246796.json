Instead of a pale-skinned, forward-facing Venus, viewers are shown the back of a black woman lying perfectly still on a marble slab. Her entire head is covered—either smothered or shielded—by a pile of small stones; subtle breath movements are the only sign of life. By hiding facial and sexual features, the artists offer some protection for this real person being presented as an idealized object. The video's title comes from a Gwendolyn Brooks poem, in which life's honey is stored but not tasted. It is saved as the speaker heads to war, the time of his return unknown, suggesting a parallel in the defensive precautions black women use to survive life's daily hostilities.
