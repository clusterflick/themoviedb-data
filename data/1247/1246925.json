How can an uninteresting person find something interesting to do? If a man finally finds something he finds interesting, what does it have to do with his own meaning? Or are the two actually the same thing at some point? If a person thinks his existence is meaningless, then at least he has the concept of meaning in his mind. If he thinks that the meaning itself is meaningless, he just thinks \"nothing is nothing\" and then denies the meaning according to that meaning to have any other meaning than \"nothing is\". Defining the concept of meaning as \"empty\" does not prove that meaning cannot \"have\". Maybe he just hasn't found it yet, maybe found it but not sure. Of course, it's possible that he'll never be able to find it, or even if he does, he'll never be sure...","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yi Yi Jin Pao","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4544647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liao Wang","original_name":"Liao Wang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d2aff54bc38b0189548f5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
