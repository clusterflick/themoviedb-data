Weaving verite scenes of Carlton's isolated, impoverished, yet passionately dedicated existence with archival material and poignant encounters with other artists, an untold story of cultural cross-pollination emerges: pre-war African-American diaspora, American Army presence in Calcutta during World War II, Jazz in Bollywood and US State Department sponsored jazz tours in India. Musical performances and archival music accentuate a story that spans a historical arc from 1926 to the 1980s Finding Carlton revives the intense power of a largely undocumented jazz movement.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding Carlton - Uncovering the Story of Jazz in India","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2139863","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
