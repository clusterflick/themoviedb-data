He empties his house and puts his memories in boxes the removal company loads onto their truck to take them to Spain. Another Galician man, the filmmaker Hugo Amoedo, who is based in Brussels, too, wonders whether and when he’ll be back in his homeland. In the meantime, he teaches his son to ride a bike, wonders, dreams, struggles to unravel ideas for films, and argues with the clerks of the Brussels post.","popularity":0.1432,"poster_path":"/hJBHHCS8XvZ2WKqujQcMANu8H7l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":221125,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vanderlux","origin_country":""},{"id":184355,"logo_path":"/zM5VRTYm17O5WhKH54UAmJNltpJ.png","name":"Dérives","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2024-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Galician","iso_639_1":"gl","name":"Galego"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Closed boxes open boxes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"caisses fermées caisses ouvertes","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"cerrar cajas abrir cajas","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4559278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xavier Queipo","original_name":"Xavier Queipo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65dcf3404c1bb001697c9b3f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4793955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cé Tomé","original_name":"Cé Tomé","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"667ab0e092f36373131596a6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4793958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Amoeda Alvarez Morillo","original_name":"Luca Amoeda Alvarez Morillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"667ab146211446f544567d6e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4530600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Amoedo","original_name":"Hugo Amoedo","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d1ef8bb422420187b31fd7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4530600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Amoedo","original_name":"Hugo Amoedo","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d1ef3e77c01f01630ee942","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4530600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Amoedo","original_name":"Hugo Amoedo","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dcf361344a8e018736bf4c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4530600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Amoedo","original_name":"Hugo Amoedo","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ab00ba975df13ea5a3359","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785690,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Théo Jegat","original_name":"Théo Jegat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ab0783c1d70c686cbc55f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4530600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Amoedo","original_name":"Hugo Amoedo","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ab02345510650efa0ac15","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4530614,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cédric Plisnier","original_name":"Cédric Plisnier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ab04d236f5e0c718be4c3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4797561,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul Millot","original_name":"Paul Millot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667d3ae99055c8a09e09205e","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4797564,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julie Freres","original_name":"Julie Freres","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/6Luw4SJUyqKsLEEmFDaDYuBmZ8b.jpg","credit_id":"667d3d481c023b09d56ec698","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1QOQOAKZ36XyYsKpdXdUzNQ0gsx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1895,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hJBHHCS8XvZ2WKqujQcMANu8H7l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1340}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":251150,"name":"cultural identity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TEASER_ENG_Pechar caixas abrir caixas de Hugo Amoedo Canal","key":"901067047","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-01-09T08:32:40.000Z","id":"667ab431f1c9e36e19cbc599"}]}}}
