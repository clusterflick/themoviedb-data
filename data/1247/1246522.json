Disregarding his duties, he instead begins gambling with the locals. He sets up a game board, Patolli, a favorite among gamblers. Atop the game board sits an effigy embodying the dual natured pair, Xochipilli, lord of gambling and luck, and his male lover, the old coyote god, Huehuecoyotl, lord of tricks and misfortune. Having earned a substantial wealth off of the poor locals, Six Rabbit decides to end his night of success. But soon after dismantling the protective effigy, gambling with luck soon turns to gambling with lives.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Merchant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
