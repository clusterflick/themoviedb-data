As Charles Darwin composed his theory of natural selection, he began defining for the modern generation a suitable, if altogether scientific answer for the origin of man. While this theory has gone largely unchallenged scientifically for the past 150 years, there is one segment of society that has been consistently uncomfortable with its revelations--the community of faith. Does the Bible provide a narrative of mankind's material origins? What is the real source of the controversy surrounding evolution vs. creation? How do we reconcile scientific discovery with a loving, universal, Creator-God? In From the Dust, renowned theologians, educators, and scientists reexamine this perennial debate, and infuse it with fresh theories, new theological insights, and an open desire for truth and dialogue.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/q4mGZflkqHgh15mNX0YPVVqIOW0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From the Dust","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4230719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Polkinghorne","original_name":"John Polkinghorne","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/7iIN9Mg2ZlnNNO4MYKpu05gs3op.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65d16ed5a06645018619c1d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3681580,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"N.T.
