Olha is a migrant care worker in Naples, whose life could fill up a few telenovelas. And yet, it is so similar to the lives of many Ukrainian women in Italy. Will Olha be able to give Naples a chance and find a true feeling among the routines of her transnational life?  The full-length film is based on a short documentary film of the same title by the same director, which was filmed as part of the Verzio Film Festival's DocLab workshop in 2016.","popularity":0.0744,"poster_path":"/bFlwna5bOl4cmR0te4zc36aps9G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2019-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Olha's Italian Diary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3542962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olena Fedyuk","original_name":"Olena Fedyuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3D26RaBDH2Ab0Q7dzMLZ75DsaRq.jpg","credit_id":"65d0d04ee627190181719a41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3542962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olena Fedyuk","original_name":"Olena Fedyuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3D26RaBDH2Ab0Q7dzMLZ75DsaRq.jpg","credit_id":"65d0d059fd63000163c9ff70","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3542962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olena Fedyuk","original_name":"Olena Fedyuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3D26RaBDH2Ab0Q7dzMLZ75DsaRq.jpg","credit_id":"65d0d066fd63000186ca85ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2129636,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eszter Csepeli","original_name":"Eszter Csepeli","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d0d077e627190181719a7e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1752027,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Viktor Onysko","original_name":"Віктор Онисько","popularity":0.0443,"profile_path":"/5W9U0YGvGd0FCZED44j2XIr79NJ.jpg","credit_id":"65d0d08962fcd3018741533f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31349843","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bFlwna5bOl4cmR0te4zc36aps9G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vienna, CEU Summer University screenings","release_date":"2019-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ethnofest Athens Ethnographic Film Festival","release_date":"2021-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival","release_date":"2021-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
