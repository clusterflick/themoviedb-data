She believes in love and thinks it is possible to find a beautiful romantic relationship even at the age of 57. The short film is an intimate sneak-peek into one of the contemporary taboo topics: intimate lives of the female migrants away from home. Will Olha be able to give Naples a chance and find a true feeling among the condemnation and suspicion?  The short film was produced during Verzio Film Festival's DocLab workshop in November 8-13, 2016, Budapest, Hungary. Subsequently, the director made a full-length film based on the same material. The full-length film received the same title as the short film. The short film was used as a trailer in promotion.","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":"/fvooMPq7GsbAReRJUl0mosqepV1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2016-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Olha's Italian Diary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3542962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olena Fedyuk","original_name":"Olena Fedyuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3D26RaBDH2Ab0Q7dzMLZ75DsaRq.jpg","credit_id":"65d0d4a0f2cf25017ae1e3aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2129636,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eszter Csepeli","original_name":"Eszter Csepeli","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d0d4b21d31430184ba446c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4541823,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Melinda Sukosd","original_name":"Melinda Sukosd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d0d4c12dda890162dce5f2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31349911","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1327,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fvooMPq7GsbAReRJUl0mosqepV1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":940}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Olha's Italian Diary Verzio13 DocLab","key":"0Cb9DhqV_wQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2016-12-08T17:00:31.000Z","id":"65d0d53d693e2001634f1476"}]}}}
