The world Prouvost invents here might perhaps originate with the 11 cm figurine known as the “Venus of Willendorf” as great-grandmother of us all. The artist borrows the story of this stone-age sculpture, reinterpreting and interweaving contextual motifs. Among the many interpretations that fascinate Prouvost is one whereby the figurine, named “Venus” by her finder, might not be a fertility symbol but rather a representation of a wise grandmother.","popularity":0.0445,"poster_path":"/fpQGCeLq3vWZ0bBdxSdg51rbNbq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You, My, Omma, Mama","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1350159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laure Prouvost","original_name":"Laure Prouvost","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d0a480c8f3c4017ceee1cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1616,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fpQGCeLq3vWZ0bBdxSdg51rbNbq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1078}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CPH:DOX","release_date":"2024-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
