To reveal social processes, the author uses a special monologue method, and the vision itself is realized by combining the internal analysis of the hero of the film and its director, who returns to Syria and sees his country after a long absence differently, than it was before the war. The film shows the destruction and vandalism caused by terrorists in many archeological, religious and residential areas of the country, which became dangerous for the population, especially in late 2015 and early 2016 - the most difficult phases of the war on Syrian soil.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":"/tVqJiZGOI3X9Jp8lR97xWKemMkT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2021-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Above Ground","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Над землею","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4541957,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Somar Afif Agha","original_name":"Somar Afif Agha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d0de35c8f3c4017cef16c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15964498","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"FILMABOVEGROUND","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tVqJiZGOI3X9Jp8lR97xWKemMkT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival","release_date":"2021-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Над землею / Above ground (Trailer)","key":"Gl7kLH0Lgyk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-08-29T16:34:10.000Z","id":"65d0dd6b20ecaf017c2f8e12"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"trailer_1 Documentary film ABOVE GROUND By Somar Afif Agha","key":"G3L9bd-T2EI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-08-29T16:15:51.000Z","id":"65d0dd742dda890147dc2337"}]}}}
