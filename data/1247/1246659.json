And so, with the help of his assistant Jasper he begins photographing models hanging, shot by arrows, as gladiators dying in the arena, as victims of strangulations, as street toughs losing knife fights, etc. Only problem is, Nathan, Jasper, and new assistant Zachary are all psychopaths whose fascination with death and killing goes way beyond mere art. And, really, just who is manipulating who? It becomes hard to tell as we journey down the ever-darker path to full-on insanity with these three killers and their hapless victims.","popularity":0.142,"poster_path":"/ouMsfumGQUVyELZ3S0vXnTRNuaD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dead Guys
