Despite her mother, Debrah, appearing to have everything under control, the vacation is hitting some turbulence. Madea isn't ready to leave the country; Brian doesn't approve of his daughter's hasty wedding or her immature fianc√©e; Tiffany starts to doubt Zavier; and Debrah's acting out of character.
