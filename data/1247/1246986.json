Superheroes and other toy action figures are used to act out the artist’s narrative to a pulsing musical soundtrack. Monteavaro’s fascination with the British 1980s pop star Adam Ant is represented through the presence of his action figure in one of the film’s lead roles. He is accompanied by toys including “Power Woman,” a Wonder Woman-like character who is a stand-in for the artist. In the battle between good and evil – one character even has “evil” written on its chest – it remains unclear who will ultimately prevail. Although it appears that “good” will triumph, there are indications that the battle will continue.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fL8H4e72uWfQNpsn3haASI8ZVUQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Friend or Foe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4545037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beatriz Monteavaro","original_name":"Beatriz Monteavaro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d2f865761421017cffb308","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fL8H4e72uWfQNpsn3haASI8ZVUQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1434}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
