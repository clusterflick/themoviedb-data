Fortunately, Kupfer's interpretation places Brünnhilde and Hagen at its center and the singers are well up to the task. Deborah Polaski's final scene, so critical to any performance of the cycle, is excellent, the voice warm, the emotions palpable. Her moving performance here is ample compensation for the touch of vocal hardness she displays in the opening scenes. As Hagen, the veteran bass Matti Salminen offers a great portrayal: firm of voice, creating a complex character, not a stage villain. Also notable are soprano Elisabete Matos, who makes Gutrune a sympathetic character, and Julia Juon, whose Waltraute is more involving than usual.","popularity":0.1096,"poster_path":"/rAOzha1Zq5tCtyryuECi5q0TImR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":284,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wagner - Götterdämmerung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1654517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Polaski","original_name":"Deborah Polaski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Brünnhilde","credit_id":"663a4c49470ead01221433c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matti Salminen","original_name":"Matti Salminen","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/85f1AMUU64wTADtLjQN4xLkM8cG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hagen","credit_id":"663a4c87c9054f0130921db4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2409640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Treleaven","original_name":"John Treleaven","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/7ygqUyUbiAqsw2lCIZ0GK6OEoNH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Siegfried","credit_id":"663a4cdb66565a0123173102","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1314396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Falk Struckmann","original_name":"Falk Struckmann","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Gunther","credit_id":"663a4cf2a4af8f012b00e1f3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bertrand de Billy","original_name":"Bertrand de Billy","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/chCShuWhFDOiBmN9ylurMMxVS6d.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"66ba2a2f72a15e42c7257eeb","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Kupfer","original_name":"Harry Kupfer","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663a4d49a4af8f013100e348","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rAOzha1Zq5tCtyryuECi5q0TImR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2005-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
