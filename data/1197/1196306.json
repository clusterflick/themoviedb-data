Two months later, the army broke into the house in which he was being held captive in order to release him. That same day, one of the guerrillas was abducted and disappeared by the civic-military dictatorship. Decades later, the director of this film, and the son of that guerrilla man, meets to talk with the businessman’s son and grandsons. The Businessman is made up of talks, but also of magazines, poster, flyers, photographs, newspapers, ads, home movies and objects that are also the testimony of a time; its editing makes personal memories intertwine with the story, and in it, the question of the relationship between who’s filming and who’s being filmed becomes inescapable.","popularity":0.2603,"poster_path":"/6eSxPxYh5JYZ72MpseFq6cQSldc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2023-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Businessman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1047234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germán Scelso","original_name":"Germán Scelso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539fd8c2811a100c90a6d62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1047234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germán Scelso","original_name":"Germán Scelso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539fd98955c6500aa5b6d2c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1047234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germán Scelso","original_name":"Germán Scelso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539fd9c955c650138bc477d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1047234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germán Scelso","original_name":"Germán Scelso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539fda6ec455200ea4da3f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1047234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germán Scelso","original_name":"Germán Scelso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539fdaa24f2ce01390fd581","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4340165,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tomás Sabattini","original_name":"Tomás Sabattini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539fdb924f2ce01390fd594","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2966326,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laura Bruno","original_name":"Laura Bruno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539fdc6955c65011be10d6b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6eSxPxYh5JYZ72MpseFq6cQSldc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Internacional de Cine de Mar del Plata","release_date":"2023-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
