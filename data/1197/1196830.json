Elma Pelozo is 80 years old and the mother of Gabino Ruiz Díaz, a young man who died during the war, and who remained buried in the Darwin cemetery for three decades as a “soldier only known by God.” Gabino is one of the Argentinian heroes who gained back their identity thanks to the work done by Geoffrey Cardozo and Julio Aro. Elma has two dreams—meeting Geoffrey Cardozo, the person who buried his son with honors, and traveling to Malvinas to visit his grave.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5Syk74fWy6t7y3yFP4Gh6m25saM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":212108,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fundación No Me Olvides","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2023-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elma’s Dreams.
