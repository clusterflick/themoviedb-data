Diagnosed with diabetes at 17, Stephen led a reckless, obese life until he finally changed his ways. Based on his life, the video teaches a valuable lesson about proper diabetes care. Stephen narrates as Stuart Pankin mimics his buddy's former life as a 320-pound couch potato who gorges on pizza, beer, and junk food. Simple, hilarious vignettes recreated from films like Mission Impossible, Psycho, Austin Powers and other popular flicks parody Stephen's evil ways and demonstrate the point of good diabetes management in an exaggerated way, drawing Stuart into each of the plots.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"D4G","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0284023","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
