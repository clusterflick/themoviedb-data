As in her books, Bodoc speaks to the children frankly about important things—water, the wind, death. Although, rather than speaking to them, she asks them—she looks into their stories and invites them to give shape to their ideas. But Lagunas is not exactly a documentary about Liliana Bodoc; it’s about lots of things—about the ghosts that inhabit a territory, about the bridges between generations, about memory. In Lagunas there are curious children, there are teachers and shamans, there are bodies buried in the sand, there is a culture and a language that refuse to become extinct. There is a filmmaker who, as he records, asks himself about his memories and about the memories he is leaving to his children. And there is also a writer who proves that in order to write, first you have to know how to listen.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/l6RGFnyMjohiHyzm3vYk2vWNT36.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138289,"logo_path":"/bhDOWwcdpIq81hlShNlw6MpfFrd.png","name":"Año Luz Cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2024-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lagunas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2962112,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federico Cardone","original_name":"Federico Cardone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539ce44b87aec00fd9b4133","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2962112,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federico Cardone","original_name":"Federico Cardone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539ce55091e620138b40ac2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2962112,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federico Cardone","original_name":"Federico Cardone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539ce48091e6200fec62689","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2962112,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federico Cardone","original_name":"Federico Cardone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539ce4f091e6200acbd0b6b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1764976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariano Donoso","original_name":"Mariano Donoso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539ce74b87aec00c3a2d194","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4340029,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martín Chiarpoti","original_name":"Martín Chiarpoti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539ce9924f2ce00ff712775","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4251559,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alejandro Alonso","original_name":"Alejandro Alonso","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539ce8fec4552010b3b0f78","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4340030,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrés Cicarelli","original_name":"Andrés Cicarelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539ceaf67825900e446fcc9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683533,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dámaris Rendón","original_name":"Dámaris Rendón","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539ceb7678259013cd0cbc2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l6RGFnyMjohiHyzm3vYk2vWNT36.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Internacional de Cine de Mar del Plata","release_date":"2023-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
