Until then, it was believed that they had been destroyed during the last military dictatorship. Fifty years later, those images are projected again, taking us to an almost unknown period of Córdoba cinema and a time of unprecedented political, social and cultural effervescence. Each frame exceeds its original intention, to tell us about a group of young people passionate about cinema and the interests that mobilized them: psychology, militancy, music, sexual freedom. But the appearance of a strange character linked to the fate of the cans reminds us of the abrupt and violent end of the dreams of that generation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/72YC0tjA6rpVtUouMChuwMQcUnc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139361,"logo_path":null,"name":"Punto de Fuga Cine","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":212114,"logo_path":null,"name":"DEEFE","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Las latas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2647431,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marcos Rostagno","original_name":"Marcos Rostagno","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/k5XjbD1mjquCOCSEB0xjMDYJQBo.jpg","credit_id":"653b5e8ccc9683014eb84e08","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1740818,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lucía Torres Minoldo","original_name":"Lucía Torres Minoldo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653b5e7a519bbb00c4330fb8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3007181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santiago Sein","original_name":"Santiago Sein","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653b5e45564ec7013c2031d2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3007181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santiago Sein","original_name":"Santiago Sein","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653b5e1d109cd0010b029844","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2647431,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marcos Rostagno","original_name":"Marcos Rostagno","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/k5XjbD1mjquCOCSEB0xjMDYJQBo.jpg","credit_id":"653b5ea5719aeb00fe3bc599","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2540472,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ana Lucía Frau","original_name":"Ana Lucía Frau","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653b5e86cc968300ade5ea11","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3007181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santiago Sein","original_name":"Santiago Sein","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653b5e21bc2cb300aca2aa8f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8jGLd7Ll151Ls3iO8pyf95L3p2U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/72YC0tjA6rpVtUouMChuwMQcUnc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
