The whore (Babylon) - now without home - resides in the canals of an imaginary city, opens a bar and casts pearls before swine. We accompany a not so young couple for a little stretch of the desperate life on their odyssey through the canals : one more down here = one less up there! They land before the meat pots of Babylon that invite them for a cannibalistic dinner. Babylon can sing EVERYTHING and must leave.","popularity":0.0575,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Suvlaki is Babylon: Come, Eat with Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Souvlaki, c'est Babylone: viens manger avec moi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4338871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Echnaton Schano","original_name":"Hans Echnaton Schano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"653922ba9c24fc0103e1157a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4338872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Pfeifer","original_name":"Karl Pfeifer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"653922cc41aac400e040ec10","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4338873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Karner","original_name":"Andreas Karner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"653922dbae3668014da68cb3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4338874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Si.
