Many were sent to recreational camps in Russia by their parents to escape the shelling; they were then stuck there, sometimes for months, waiting for their mothers to bring them back. Others were fostered into Russian families, led to believe that Russia had saved them after their parents had abandoned them. This remarkable doc explores the journey of these children, and the parents trying to bring them home.","popularity":0.1076,"poster_path":"/5zZwlZk2CbAEvmWJhsxYRD2Uodv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The harrowing search for the Ukrainian children taken into Russia","title":"Ukraine's Stolen Children","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4339946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Farah","original_name":"Isabelle Farah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Voiceover","credit_id":"6539b8bbb87aec00abd336d6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2453029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shahida Tulaganova","original_name":"Shahida Tulaganova","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539b8f5b87aec00abd3371b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2453029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shahida Tulaganova","original_name":"Shahida Tulaganova","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539b901b87aec00fd9b2fdb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1254759,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sam Billinge","original_name":"Sam Billinge","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539b92167825900c7e82a09","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338616,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex Cooke","original_name":"Alex Cooke","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539b9718a0e9b00c938f61a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1510541,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alan Hayling","original_name":"Alan Hayling","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/oRhoobU028XKpTXaTzbSnyvVOcm.jpg","credit_id":"6539b984955c6500febfff18","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29607542","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5zZwlZk2CbAEvmWJhsxYRD2Uodv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
