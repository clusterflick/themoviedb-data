It involves five people, three locations, and the different subjects and forms of knowledge that they bring with them. These range from urban tensions – such as unresolved histories of the 2011 London riots – to music and the personal ways in which each of the protagonists relate to ideas of the political. Material gathered in a concentrated two-day shoot has been brought together in a film installation specially conceived for The Showroom, London NW8.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Left to Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1465916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wendelien van Oldenborgh","original_name":"Wendelien van Oldenborgh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653a73f8d35dea013b96b1a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
