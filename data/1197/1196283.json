Analog Thinking answers that question by documenting the meticulous work of those who choose that path. The screen becomes filled with wonderful objects—optical toys, cameras, projectors, film stock cans, moviolas… And the testimonies from those creators invite us to discover a universe that has a lot to do with both craftsmanship and the collective experience—an instance of thinking with your hands that is only possible with curiosity and patience. And among the words, practices and artifacts, Analog Thinking also saves a place for the images that are born from all of that. And it reminds us that, even in this digital age, they still have a lot to teach us about waiting and making mistakes, surprise and beauty.","popularity":0.2987,"poster_path":"/v5FdBbE989XJyvGAPIG8AktaWxW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":211998,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rioabajo Producciones","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2023-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Analog Thinking","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2010534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulo Pécora","original_name":"Paulo Pécora","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/gDMbA9WFMErpHmAFq0xeZsdtIAq.jpg","credit_id":"6539dd1d24f2ce00ff712ff5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2010534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulo Pécora","original_name":"Paulo Pécora","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/gDMbA9WFMErpHmAFq0xeZsdtIAq.jpg","credit_id":"6539dd2267825900adffde2c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2010534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulo Pécora","original_name":"Paulo Pécora","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/gDMbA9WFMErpHmAFq0xeZsdtIAq.jpg","credit_id":"6539dd27091e62011bafe8a1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2010534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paulo Pécora","original_name":"Paulo Pécora","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/gDMbA9WFMErpHmAFq0xeZsdtIAq.jpg","credit_id":"6539dd2d678259011ecdddf6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1172385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mónica Lairana","original_name":"Mónica Lairana","popularity":0.0864,"profile_path":"/2C7RTfO844bKxLqbbtyGF8cYYXy.jpg","credit_id":"6539dd3bec455200c921e3d6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1172385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mónica Lairana","original_name":"Mónica Lairana","popularity":0.0864,"profile_path":"/2C7RTfO844bKxLqbbtyGF8cYYXy.jpg","credit_id":"6539dd3e678259011ecdde05","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2314519,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nubia Campos Vieira","original_name":"Nubia Campos Vieira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539dd47955c6500e1fea492","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088183,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juan Manuel Molteni","original_name":"Juan Manuel Molteni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539dd4f678259013cd0d3e6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2869269,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hernán Hayet","original_name":"Hernán Hayet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539de9b2811a100ea080eb2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v5FdBbE989XJyvGAPIG8AktaWxW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Internacional de Cine de Mar del Plata","release_date":"2023-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
