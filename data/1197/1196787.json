He became a gay icon after the publication of his memoir, The Naked Civil Servant in 1968, and even more of a celebrity when the book was filmed in 1975 with John Hurt in the starring role. This documentary asks how such a public figure - and a queer icon - fits into ideas of family, and in particular into his own family. Through an exploration of photographs, home movies and interviews with relatives, UNCLE DENIS? reflects on how traditions of familial memory-making intersect with the more public image-fashioning of one of the twentieth century's most determinedly self-made men.","popularity":0.0725,"poster_path":"/lozfb8PT84beAunxQxk8xY9OsHa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uncle Denis?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Quentin Crisp","original_name":"Quentin Crisp","popularity":0.1642,"profile_path":"/9kp2xAPdUtZnmSTmpiNxoBQz5Tj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"653b22d0bc2cb3010b49d17f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302744,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adrian Goycoolea","original_name":"Adrian Goycoolea","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"653b22d6109cd000ad615f5d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3297506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Goyocolea-Crawford","original_name":"Michelle Goyocolea-Crawford","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"653b22e1719aeb00ab2a62f4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4341971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elaine Pratt","original_name":"Elaine Pratt","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"653b22e8bc2cb300c97d48e6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4341973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances Ramsay","original_name":"Frances Ramsay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"653b22f2564ec700c8aac5c2","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2302744,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adrian Goycoolea","original_name":"Adrian Goycoolea","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653b22aae894a600c51527f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1377241","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lozfb8PT84beAunxQxk8xY9OsHa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
