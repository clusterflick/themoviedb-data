For Ongoing Cave, his third work, the director goes back underground, this time in a literal manner, in order to reveal the mysteries of speleology, the science that studies caves and caverns. Italy, Slovenia, Cuba; antiwar bunkers; an exploring, revolutionary ballerina; an electronic party in which the stalactites and stalagmites dance under the flashlights. Everything is part of the ecosystem of tunnels and people that D’Angiolillo connects on screen, through images in which what lies still comes to life.","popularity":0.3164,"poster_path":"/9xcDTOLqpm0gL8n8rGWQDSVrcX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51613,"logo_path":"/3DgCWaJxvgWEQ9OyLZ7FmbDEtzH.png","name":"Lita Stantic Producciones","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"2023-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ongoing Cave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julián D'Angiolillo","original_name":"Julián D'Angiolillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653a004a2811a1010b1de995","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julián D'Angiolillo","original_name":"Julián D'Angiolillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653a004e67825900e4471644","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julián D'Angiolillo","original_name":"Julián D'Angiolillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653a0053091e620138b426cb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julián D'Angiolillo","original_name":"Julián D'Angiolillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653a0056b87aec011a1d12ab","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julián D'Angiolillo","original_name":"Julián D'Angiolillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653a005c24f2ce01390fd6f3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1335912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Mazzolo","original_name":"Pablo Mazzolo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/cnLvObugfYlFWk0PV6vICpPSQqZ.jpg","credit_id":"653a0066ec4552014d6ea0ec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249405,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mercedes Tennina","original_name":"Mercedes Tennina","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653a006d2811a1012c9900b7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522000,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicolás Varchausky","original_name":"Nicolás Varchausky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653a00752811a100ea082365","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":976406,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lita Stantic","original_name":"Lita Stantic","popularity":0.201,"profile_path":"/hI9OfVGTBccQdry6GcA2WMVoP02.jpg","credit_id":"653a007f678259011ecdee6b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9xcDTOLqpm0gL8n8rGWQDSVrcX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1807},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jX0Ls5W17zKjCmsxksiHR8inRrN.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":700},{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/std8bwF5pWZdXlWINGHAQMuAjKT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":620}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Internacional de Cine de Mar del Plata","release_date":"2023-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
