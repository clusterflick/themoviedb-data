An enigmatic and reclusive talent, Siffre wrote the song It Must Be Love, later covered by Madness, alongside songs of defiance like the classic anti-apartheid anthem (Something Inside) So Strong. In a highly unusual and uncompromising creative life, Siffre has produced nine albums to date â€“ a somewhat overlooked back catalogue whose range and quality is nothing short of extraordinary. His hugely impressive body of work has in recent years also proved rich territory for an array of hip-hop heavyweights with Dr Dre and Eminem, Jay Z and Kanye West all discovering and sampling his music, bringing it to an entirely new generation of listeners around the world.","popularity":0.1649,"poster_path":"/oqAMYnebtZ2RlCLkZ8EjFGlP6ju.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Labi Siffre: This Is My Song","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4338941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Labi Siffre","original_name":"Labi Siffre","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65392ce094631800e38367bc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Yentob","original_name":"Alan Yentob","popularity":0.4371,"profile_path":"/cE1TVynSWTO2iPcVcNwWNZt3wbN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65392ceb41aac400e040f0cb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2215707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke McMahon","original_name":"Luke McMahon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65392d5b0fb17f00abc13f2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682775,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tanya Hudson","original_name":"Tanya Hudson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65392d6cf495ee011c245047","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oqAMYnebtZ2RlCLkZ8EjFGlP6ju.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
