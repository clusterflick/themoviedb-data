A device brought the world to our fingertips, connected us in unparalleled ways, and streamlined communication. But for the man behind the machine, life was far from streamlined.  The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs, by acclaimed San Francisco composer Mason Bates and Pulitzer-winning librettist Mark Campbell, comes home to the place where it all began.  Under the baton of Michael Christie, Bates' score takes us on an operatic journey through the fragmented memory of love, betrayal, obsession and death, weaving together classical lyricism and a techno soundscape informed by the audio of early computers.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cl01yJnJRpkhb7Z94EaQnQIHIvn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1180,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cl01yJnJRpkhb7Z94EaQnQIHIvn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":787}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
