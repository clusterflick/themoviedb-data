Some of them have to do with the origin of their relationship, others with its extremes, from the most tense to the most playful. However, all of them converge in a common denominator that keeps them together despite everything. Dueto is the story of two men who, without any shame, allow their friendship to affirm, with conviction, its real name—love. One that is sometimes tender and light, other times possessive and rough, but always ready for a generous indulgence that doesn’t need that of the flesh. The two of them turn Dueto into an oath made of film, in order to honor the pact of that powerful shared feeling.","popularity":0.1102,"poster_path":"/mWBuyfnXvKKaub9ee9dNmxl4KVo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127382,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumen Cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2023-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Duet","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":127339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgardo Cozarinsky","original_name":"Edgardo Cozarinsky","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/ohvnmqBj5DyXvj4uD3veAqF0yDS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6539db942811a100adb09787","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafael Ferro","original_name":"Rafael Ferro","popularity":0.2117,"profile_path":"/rBPfuNG5p0mnPWMl0WgWbuxnW0p.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6539db9d2811a1012c98ec44","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1704563,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aníbal Garisto","original_name":"Aníbal Garisto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539dbf2091e620138b412a9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafael Ferro","original_name":"Rafael Ferro","popularity":0.2117,"profile_path":"/rBPfuNG5p0mnPWMl0WgWbuxnW0p.jpg","credit_id":"6539dba8ec4552012c19fa40","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":127339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgardo Cozarinsky","original_name":"Edgardo Cozarinsky","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/ohvnmqBj5DyXvj4uD3veAqF0yDS.jpg","credit_id":"6539db8b24f2ce011c649ef3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2456719,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Iair Michel Attías","original_name":"Iair Michel Attías","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539dbba091e620138b41281","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafael Ferro","original_name":"Rafael Ferro","popularity":0.2117,"profile_path":"/rBPfuNG5p0mnPWMl0WgWbuxnW0p.jpg","credit_id":"6539dba3b87aec00e002e2cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1775528,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ulises Conti","original_name":"Ulises Conti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539dbe1091e62011bafe7be","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1456110,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gaspar Scheuer","original_name":"Gaspar Scheuer","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539dbd8091e6200fec62e5c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3272258,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Santiago Cánepa","original_name":"Santiago Cánepa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539dbb1955c6500c4554eb6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4340056,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bárbara Dafne Brandt","original_name":"Bárbara Dafne Brandt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539dbcbec4552010b3b1747","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":127339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgardo Cozarinsky","original_name":"Edgardo Cozarinsky","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/ohvnmqBj5DyXvj4uD3veAqF0yDS.jpg","credit_id":"6539db88955c6500e1fea351","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29899805","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mWBuyfnXvKKaub9ee9dNmxl4KVo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Internacional de Cine de Mar del Plata","release_date":"2023-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
