This incompleteness, which could then be attributed to the director’s aesthetics, always free and prone to absurdity, was actually a pause that now, four years later, is resumed. The protagonist continues to be Débora, a somewhat insecure tattoo artist who ends up involved in the resistance when a new batch of invaders threatens to wipe out every single record of the human race. With the childlike strokes and the uncontrollably innocent humor characteristic of him, Blasco continues to shape his own epic, a hallucinated version of El Eternauta, with click beetles and all.","popularity":0.4039,"poster_path":"/9IsAHCUdORFSnipBWh6qSSrlU29.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29856,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crudo
