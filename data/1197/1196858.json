After being raped, Hank, a trans person, finds himself knocked up and alone. In spite of a lifetime of attempts, Hank can't shake his Christian guilt and is in a constant wrestling match with his choices. We follow Hank through a series of encounters with a quirky cast of characters that can only be found in the South. Mama's too drunk to lend an ear. His older boyfriend - Trampus - is full of condemnation. Honey Lynn, the town glamazon, is a breath of fresh air that offers the most unexpected solution. The film is a 'queer' ride that hopes to increase awareness between cultures and implement discussions between those from different backgrounds in order to implement positive change. It is an illustration of the experience of being raised in the God-fearing South and discovering the difference between spirituality and religion.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/qXUzwAQx1IDpucV4EEGBdGheMlE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queer and Southern God","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3460475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Burch","original_name":"Mel Burch","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"653b5cb35907de0138e0a226","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4342265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noelle DeAtley","original_name":"Noelle DeAtley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"653b5cb95907de00e1a12174","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4342266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Hill","original_name":"Adrian Hill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"653b5cce519bbb01383158e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathy Butler Sandvoss","original_name":"Kathy Butler Sandvoss","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"653b5cd5bc2cb300eafbde98","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4342264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melisse Tokic","original_name":"Melisse Tokic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653b5c90bc2cb3010b49f701","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7858736","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qXUzwAQx1IDpucV4EEGBdGheMlE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
