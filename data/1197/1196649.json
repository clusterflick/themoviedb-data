Dead outlaws. Warm beer. All these await Charley Stone in the afterlife -- and life after death ain't quite what he expected. Charley is reunited with two old friends -- a rifleman named Jake and a philosophizing barkeep, Cole -- as well as a band of ruthless enemies from lives past. Somewhere in the harsh drylands lie the keys to Charley's forgotten past -- a troubled former life as Ben Kane, a Texas Ranger whose ruthless justice sent many outlaws to Hell long ago. Part action movie, part philosophical musing, Hell is Texas is a gothic western that redefines the ghost story -- a harsh tale of redemption, rediscovery, and revenge from beyond the grave.","popularity":0.1072,"poster_path":"/rCrRvt1KsRxKVKy8kqscJybv20R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":212070,"logo_path":null,"name":"Puppy Dog Head Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":212071,"logo_path":null,"name":"Some Big Ass Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Charley Stone Always Thought Texas was Hell... then He Died.","title":"Hell Is Texas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":179973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Nutter","original_name":"Mark Nutter","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/vDXuDvoF07PaFrQ7WzZkRpiIa1l.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Charley Stone","credit_id":"653ad10d5907de011bc38f66","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2051160,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jamie Dierlam","original_name":"Jamie Dierlam","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Dis","credit_id":"653ad148e894a600ad559d5c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyler Mason","original_name":"Tyler Mason","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jake","credit_id":"653ad15a5907de00e1a0c9cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4341524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Hamby","original_name":"Rick Hamby","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Cole","credit_id":"653ad170519bbb00e18b35a2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1404273,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"R.
