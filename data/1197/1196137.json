It’s 1895 and Annie Londonderry has returned victorious to America, hailed as the first woman to ever cycle around the world. She’s pioneering, she’s plucky, and she’s pitching her story to the New York World. But she can’t do it alone. Joined at the eleventh hour by unwitting secretary Martha Smith, the two begin to share Annie’s unbelievable adventures. But before long, the cracks begin to show, and Annie is forced to confront a past she’d rather leave unexplored.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fSPmbR6Is2uhKjJGl8CjIsrxGc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RIDE: A New Musical","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1180,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fSPmbR6Is2uhKjJGl8CjIsrxGc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":787}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
