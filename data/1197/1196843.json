A serial killer that was given the name of “El Loco de la Ruta” was blamed for these crimes. Every investigation that had to do with these crimes was half-hearted and defective; the stigmatization of the victims was much more intense than any aim at justice. In a decade pierced by impunity and social discontent, the women, most of them still unorganized, were the only ones to raise their voices and take the cold city streets reclaiming justice.","popularity":0.0855,"poster_path":"/gRLWfKK8qqBKq9jUzI5lMUI4Ezs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2023-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Groundswell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2253044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oriana Castro","original_name":"Oriana Castro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7KKWvmqi80Kk7JeDDnJL19ok4GK.jpg","credit_id":"653b55ca109cd000c9470b01","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2253044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oriana Castro","original_name":"Oriana Castro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7KKWvmqi80Kk7JeDDnJL19ok4GK.jpg","credit_id":"653b55c5cc968300ade5e5ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolás Galvagno","original_name":"Nicolás Galvagno","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653b55facc9683014eb849d4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2253044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oriana Castro","original_name":"Oriana Castro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7KKWvmqi80Kk7JeDDnJL19ok4GK.jpg","credit_id":"653b55d1519bbb00c4330b01","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568492,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pablo Sala","original_name":"Pablo Sala","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653b55ea109cd000eae27d78","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568492,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pablo Sala","original_name":"Pablo Sala","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653b55f05907de0138e09e69","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2198771,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Emiliano Serra","original_name":"Emiliano Serra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653b55e2cc9683014eb849c3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2680284,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gastón García Guevara","original_name":"Gastón García Guevara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653b55da109cd0012cfe3d3d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gRLWfKK8qqBKq9jUzI5lMUI4Ezs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Internacional de Cine de Mar del Plata","release_date":"2023-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
