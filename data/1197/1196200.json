This is purist cinema. Shapes are just moving around, but it is virtually impossible not to project judgements, desires and a storyline onto them. With such raw materials, the perceived narrative is not about the shapes, but a reflection of the viewer’s own psychology and memories. Scientists found that viewers construct their own individual interpretations of events; there is not one common narrative, but innumerable permutations—sometimes with imagined voices or sound effects.” - Brittany Gravely / Harvard Film Archive","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fULBTWpvgwYut6xW44zyf5JLnrM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fighting Triangles: Social Perception AKA The Heider-Simmel Illusion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2423079,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fritz Heider","original_name":"Fritz Heider","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679d7ddd28bb97ddd3952ec5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2423081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianne Simmel","original_name":"Marianne Simmel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679d7deca74d8ee23b2615fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fULBTWpvgwYut6xW44zyf5JLnrM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":598}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1944-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Heider-Simmel Illusion","key":"8FIEZXMUM2I","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-02-16T17:06:51.000Z","id":"659443a9069f0e450e2157fb"}]}}}
