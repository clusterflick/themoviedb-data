The camera films two people, two bodies, alternately female or male, or both? Or neither? The viewer is confused, and doesn't know who is who, but it doesnâ€™t matter. The camera is sometimes close, sometimes distant, like a voyeur who wants to participate, who wants to be part of it. From time to time, one of the two people looks straight at the camera - and the image turns bright red, like a connection, a flash, a lightning, maybe a sudden jealousy of not being in the protagonists' shoes? The eyes then refocus on the other person, and forgets about the camera, the voyeur, who continues to stare in silence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"ENVY is a reflection about bisexuality, non-binarity, a game about gender and sex and the performance of femininity and masculinity.","title":"Envy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4341096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nyx","original_name":"Nyx","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"653a84fed35dea0101caf1f3","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4341097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ursinae","original_name":"Ursinae","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"653a85058a0e9b00ad21581b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4341104,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Shamhat","original_name":"Shamhat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653a8583ec455200ea4de491","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4341102,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carmina","original_name":"Carmina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653a856b8a0e9b010b2915cf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4341100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmina","original_name":"Carmina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653a8545ae366800ff5b74d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4341101,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carmina","original_name":"Carmina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653a8553ae366800c5b90ae5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4341103,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ser Lait","original_name":"Ser Lait","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653a8578ae366800c5b90b01","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
