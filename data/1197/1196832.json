Although he still does not know if he is going to produce it – since he thinks that his cinema will not be well received by current European sensibilities – Iván takes advantage of every moment with Carmen to record, with his cell phone in his hand and an endless smile on his face, every adventure they embark on.","popularity":0.4729,"poster_path":"/dHPfiip5FJKE0uMmX3qhYKQln1C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173459,"logo_path":"/fGPnNjkGsLing2khfNWHJ9o8gmg.png","name":"Serie Gong Cine - La
