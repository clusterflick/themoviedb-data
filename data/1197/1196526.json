Three musicians from Luanda who reflect the feeling of the young angolan generation after the demonstrations between 2011 and 2016. They took place against the ruling party (MPLA) and the president Eduardo dos Santos forcing him to step down of his position and renouncing the reelection in 2017. As a legacy to this unique and intense period where dos Santos was leaving the power of Angola after 39 years, Toty, Sacer and Helder share with us the desires, dreams, fears, frustrations and hopes that the youth angolans feel, with their music and words. Recorded during my first stay in Luanda for the field-work of a PhD on musical anthropology, this film captures the way of how young independent creators use art as a way of expressing an individual and collective identity that defy power and institutions in Africa.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luanda S(o)un(d)rise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
