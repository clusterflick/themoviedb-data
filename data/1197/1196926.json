It turns out that Abdul's wife, Lela, is currently having pregnant cravings called \"Ngidam\". She craves Betawi cuisine that is becoming rare. Her requests for \"selendang mayang\" (a traditional Betawi dish) and \"nasi ulam\" can still be fulfilled. But then, Lela asks for a difficult dish, \"sayur babanci\" (a specific vegetable dish). For several days, Abdul hasn't been able to find this dish, even though he has been traveling around Jakarta. Their third child is expected to be a boy, the child they've been waiting for after two previous daughters. His mother-in-law often reminds him of the myth that if cravings are not fulfilled, the child might be born with a birthmark. His colleagues then assist him. It turns out that Lela's cravings are not as straightforward as those of a typical pregnant woman.","popularity":0.061,"poster_path":"/7N3b9ToWA6j74MTMnh3aGQd3jG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":212126,"logo_path":null,"name":"Komik Kompasiana","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2023-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ngidam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3087711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Gondowijoyo","original_name":"Amanda Gondowijoyo","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lela","credit_id":"653b8e795907de011bc4002a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2637107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kak Jek (Jaka Perdana)","original_name":"Kak Jek (Jaka Perdana)","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/foR4XfapZvZpz4IRVLHKq0jOZWv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Abdul","credit_id":"66b73cfc268f5dac021db5a1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2354355,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Agung Jarkasih","original_name":"Agung Jarkasih","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/e1k323piyPa52DXeIcc64L0W53g.jpg","credit_id":"653b8e57719aeb011b9770d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4342432,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dewi Puspasari","original_name":"Dewi Puspasari","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653b8e67719aeb011b9770e5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7N3b9ToWA6j74MTMnh3aGQd3jG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"id","note":"Jakarta Film Week","release_date":"2023-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
