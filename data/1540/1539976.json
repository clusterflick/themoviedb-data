More than a personal remembrance, the poem carries his mother’s plea — “tell them we weren’t the only ones” — a call to acknowledge the countless lives scarred by war, displacement, and silence. Through Guzlowski’s measured reading, the film becomes both intimate and collective: a meditation on inherited trauma, the duty of memory, and the fragile line between history and forgetting.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7dskSO99hsyhuTfbbeEwurzdNsQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A mother’s tragic experiences of war and loss, carried forward by her son.","title":"We Weren't The Only One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5606831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Guzlowski","original_name":"John Guzlowski","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"68b65c8cda6801e9a19e232b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2319165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Zhort","original_name":"Alex Zhort","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/9kQeprPoiua7lpgQSisERNZaywy.jpg","credit_id":"68b65c6b65908b0fa82010a2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2319165,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Zhort","original_name":"Alex Zhort","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/9kQeprPoiua7lpgQSisERNZaywy.jpg","credit_id":"68b65c795d4b26d95d15882c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30972741","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ip3JivENemZANyZiKNiGapGuHmr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7dskSO99hsyhuTfbbeEwurzdNsQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
