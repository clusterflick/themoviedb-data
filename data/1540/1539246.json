That hard work paid off in one of the most amazing seasons in Auburn football history. Auburn fans quickly saw there was something special about this team. Dramatic wins over Mississippi State and Texas A&M, followed by two of the most unbelievable finishes you'll ever witness, \"The Miracle at Jordan-Hare\" against Georgia and the improbable fashion in which the Tigers defeated Alabama in the Iron Bowl punctuated a season to remem-ber. The Tigers topped those two incredible finishes with a triumph over Missouri and were crowned SEC Champions!","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/zxelVE1ltwld8ka69NN5VJdtYjB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":272877,"logo_path":null,"name":"Auburn IMG Sports Network","origin_country":""},{"id":272878,"logo_path":null,"name":"IMG","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A New Day: The Story of the 2013 Auburn Tigers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5656147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gus Malzahn","original_name":"Gus Malzahn","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/xCfWadKhkSHwDIITIEppj4sx1OK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68b4afc725722b2347b4f68b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5662395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhett Lashlee","original_name":"Rhett Lashlee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68b4afd025722b2347b4f696","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5662397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellis Johnson","original_name":"Ellis Johnson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"68b4afef71140ab30954e573","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5662398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodney Garner","original_name":"Rodney Garner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"68b4b001ecb40f9e4615813e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5662400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cassanova McKinzy","original_name":"Cassanova McKinzy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"68b4b0426a237666db3f0162","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5662409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corey Grant","original_name":"Corey Grant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"68b4b0f5aedac09f98200c05","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5662411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cody Parkey","original_name":"Cody Parkey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"68b4b10587660c634415804a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5662415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Marshall","original_name":"Nick Marshall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"68b4b1457c83cbc3999e1e15","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5662421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"C.J.
