The film traces Thomson's career, which began in Toronto, where he worked as a commercial artist. Later, Thomson's weekend sketching trips in the country turned into longer journeys farther north, and he finally settled in northern Ontario's Algonquin Park. Thomson spent less than four years as an artist and was barely 40 when a canoe accident ended his life. Fellow artists Lawren Harris, A.Y. Jackson and Arthur Lismer pay tribute to this genius, who, in Jackson's words, \"contributed more to Canadian painting than any other artist.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/Q50hFnhSbs6dWKLHg4STc4sJ9E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"West Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1727384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan McFee","original_name":"Allan McFee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68b607ab6210a69fb1398213","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1588041,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Graham McInnes","original_name":"Graham McInnes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b607ca4c6234278c1f2ea0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1588041,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Graham McInnes","original_name":"Graham McInnes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b60828682d48bfa31f286a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5664618,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Judith Crawley","original_name":"Judith Crawley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b608847c095dd97354ea61","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5664621,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Weinzweig","original_name":"John Weinzweig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b608b9bad29d8e84b4fca8","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Q50hFnhSbs6dWKLHg4STc4sJ9E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
