Scripts and preparation turn out to be completely unnecessary, and chaos soon ensues. But the real madness has yet to begin—because the legend isn’t as far-fetched as they thought. The psychopaths in question are still very much present. In fact, one of them harbors his own ambition to direct horror films and is handed the perfect opportunity on a silver platter.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blood Shack","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1794388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arno Pluquet","original_name":"Arno Pluquet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b5f8d66c655492c654ebab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35113286","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
