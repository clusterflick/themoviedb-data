Based on the confessions of Nikolai Stavrogin in Dostoyesvsky's The Devils, this performance is characteristic of the Squat Theatre's recombinant aesthetic, which fuses disparate cultural references. Elements include motifs from late-1940's gangster movies, music by the influential German electronic group Kraftwerk, Antonin Artaud's incendiary letter to Andre Breton, and the uncanny use of 'real life': a live dinner scene in which, night after night, the children of Squat members, along with their mother, ate their meal and engaged in conversation before the audience.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pig, Child, Fire!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5376663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Squat Theatre","original_name":"Squat Theatre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b4e69ca040e6a6c19e2772","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
