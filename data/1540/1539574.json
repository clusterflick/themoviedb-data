Counterintuitively enough, these people, united by a common idea of securing the well-being of Askania Nova, find it impossible to agree among themselves. Our hero, Nikolai Khlebniuk, was fired from his job at the reserve 20 years ago and now lives in a dilapidated hut in Askania; in spite of that, he has no plans to move elsewhere anytime soon. Our film is about the secret that keeps Nikolai in this place for decades.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Fields","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2350613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrii Lytvynenko","original_name":"Андрій Литвиненко","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/dFWekzER3cLtyL4NVvGF1sPAiLu.jpg","credit_id":"68b58463450460b491397fff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
