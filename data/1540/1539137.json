Shot entirely on VHS, Painted Room is an eerie, esoteric exploration of displacement and memory, told through the quiet rituals of a painter moving into a new home. As he brushes fresh coats onto the walls, strange visitors begin to appear—ghosts not of the dead, but of the displaced.  The film interrogates what it means to replace the old with the new. Each layer of paint becomes a scar of those who came before—a visual metaphor for lives overwritten but not erased.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/wcgFAGGiWhVsCPpwgB54dLfohNx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":272862,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rollingpin Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Painted Room","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2929079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Kombert","original_name":"Henry Kombert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68b47eea6c655492c654e53c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4230912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alec Simmons","original_name":"Alec Simmons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b47f0374f60b437f200bbe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2447596,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ross Bugden","original_name":"Ross Bugden","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/7XbGfBDWTqjfmSvacxAK27xP0wO.jpg","credit_id":"68b47f2c39a2115ab81f25a8","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5662117,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julia Waller","original_name":"Julia Waller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b47f40c31c873c839e1f0c","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5662120,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Tristan Simmons","original_name":"Tristan Simmons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b47fa25d4b26d95d158034","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5662121,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Oscar Terrell","original_name":"Oscar Terrell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b47fb7ce5cdcdb92397ee4","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5662123,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mustafa Yasin","original_name":"Mustafa Yasin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68b47ff27eda1c6aba1f2342","department":"Camera","job":"Best Boy Grip"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wcgFAGGiWhVsCPpwgB54dLfohNx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Hastings Rocks International Film Festival: Strand DRAMATIC, EXPERIMENTAL & ESOTERIC FILM","release_date":"2025-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
