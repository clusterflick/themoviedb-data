The viewer and two other participants are invited to explore four inner spaces, each one a private, intimate story told and co-created by real people. A unique, embodied experience, guiding the users step by step into the heart of human desire and the shadows it casts.  Dark Rooms is a sensory, site-specific and immersive installation that confronts the audience with their own bias and boundaries, exposing our deepest longings and the forces that may shape our sexual identities.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/w5amzCOJzubgVOCi7MKDCYCiHTg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":234539,"logo_path":null,"name":"Morph
