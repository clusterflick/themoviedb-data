The first complete descent of the canyon, with a 1,000-meter drop, was made by Thierry Krattinger, Stéphane Girard, and Jean-Claude Dobrilla in 1990. Filming took place in very difficult conditions: an aquatic atmosphere, a dramatic void, and mediocre rock in the 300-meter waterfall. The documentary Trou de Fer was selected for competition at the Trento Film Festival in 1992.","popularity":0.1143,"poster_path":"/ivzUNoEOAQZHbktGXXpr6dC6iyS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trou de Fer","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5405017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thierry Krattinger","original_name":"Thierry Krattinger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6811239ca458c27761eaad20","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5405020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphane Girard","original_name":"Stéphane Girard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"681123c1a458c27761eaad2f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5405022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Claude Dobrilla","original_name":"Jean-Claude Dobrilla","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"681123d719292f098880dffe","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5079660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Meauxsoone","original_name":"Guy Meauxsoone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gbaDBcr2uSAH96n7Ov4iPmIijYS.jpg","credit_id":"68111d0a930c895e280fcfd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5079660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Meauxsoone","original_name":"Guy Meauxsoone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gbaDBcr2uSAH96n7Ov4iPmIijYS.jpg","credit_id":"68111d10930c895e280fcfd3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36738811","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pp5pcl5oCsYs98u9dnZTmz4ZHvK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ivzUNoEOAQZHbktGXXpr6dC6iyS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":217365,"name":"canyoning"},{"id":229378,"name":"reunion island"},{"id":299404,"name":"mountain documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
