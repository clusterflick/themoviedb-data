Feeling like a burden, he isolates himself—only to be left at home with his separated sister’s son. As memories surface and generational pain echoes, he faces a critical choice: to end his life or break the cycle. A moving tale of trauma, connection, and the quiet power of presence.Through memory, silence, and unexpected connection, the film explores whether pain must be inherited—or if it can be broken.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":260761,"logo_path":null,"name":"nivas picutres","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2025-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echo of existence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5197979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"sanjoey","original_name":"Sanjoey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9eqBxoqauL2LzkYMPr5sp5uXwDL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"arul","credit_id":"6810de29eb1d4b06de0fda9f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5404489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"paari mithran","original_name":"paari mithran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"mithun - the kid","credit_id":"6810de59930c895e280fc503","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5197979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"sanjoey","original_name":"Sanjoey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9eqBxoqauL2LzkYMPr5sp5uXwDL.jpg","credit_id":"6810de762e8ba022e480e7c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5404491,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"wikkie","original_name":"wikkie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6810de88ba241d8aea814c55","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5404493,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"ashwin nivas","original_name":"ashwin nivas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6810de99eb1d4b06de0fdaf1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5404494,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"kat","original_name":"kat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6810dea85ad0b67c66eb0eee","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5404495,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"irai","original_name":"irai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6810debceb1d4b06de0fdb0b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5197979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"sanjoey","original_name":"Sanjoey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9eqBxoqauL2LzkYMPr5sp5uXwDL.jpg","credit_id":"681101a40c125a95530feb7e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ta","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
