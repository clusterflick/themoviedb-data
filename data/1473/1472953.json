Surrounded by beautiful waitress Nahoko and Daisaku, a university student who calls himself a genius inventor, she leads a happy life.  　One day, a strange phenomenon known as the “Flower Blizzard Incident”, which has been happening all over the Kansai region, occurs near Asumi's house. Yusuke, a former ace of the defence force, gets excited and starts investigating the case.  At that time, Asumi meets Ferilin, a boy fairy who holds the key to the case.  Asumi asks him about the truth behind the incident.
