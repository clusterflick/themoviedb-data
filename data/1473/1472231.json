On a mystical whim of Jennifer's, they buy an old farmhouse which stands in the shadow of a castle. While Fred spends weeks alone renovating the old house, Jennifer returns to their home in Australia to liquidate their assets. When Fred arrives at Shannon Airport to pick up Jennifer and Billie, it is Billie who emergesâ€”alone. There is no note, no explanation, not so much as a word from Jennifer, and the shock has left Billie speechless. In that instant, Fred's life falls to pieces.","popularity":0.1714,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":221347,"logo_path":"/6Ry6uNBaa0IbbSs1XYIgX5DkA9r.png","name":"Scott Free Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":227641,"logo_path":"/oX3s6MJ8yJU9QUNYQhyXtjmGlZA.png","name":"Nine Hours","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":81,"logo_path":"/8wOfUhA7vwU2gbPjQy7Vv3EiF0o.png","name":"Plan B Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":41077,"logo_path":"/1ZXsGaFPgrgS6ZZGS37AqD5uU12.png","name":"A24","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Riders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Pitt","original_name":"Brad Pitt","popularity":7.8411,"profile_path":"/bSk1OGSQ95RDxbUYuIw2NzJDcCa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Fred Scully","credit_id":"680fa1f70c125a95530f9e62","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward Berger","original_name":"Edward Berger","popularity":1.1991,"profile_path":"/st8iwTbaPHmX0lOiyGFC4sIcA8H.jpg","credit_id":"680fa1edba241d8aea810958","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39725,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Kajganich","original_name":"David Kajganich","popularity":0.3335,"profile_path":"/qEviQGEUUVkpD3WWczs2UJJHjfz.jpg","credit_id":"680fa203ba241d8aea810961","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1238434,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tim Winton","original_name":"Tim Winton","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":"/k4P9e5cQl6RTeJotxcDY3eOknfq.jpg","credit_id":"680fa21a0c125a95530f9e6f","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ridley Scott","original_name":"Ridley Scott","popularity":2.2681,"profile_path":"/zABJmN9opmqD4orWl3KSdCaSo7Q.jpg","credit_id":"680fa2450c125a95530f9e86","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1527474,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael A.
