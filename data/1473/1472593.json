A girl saves a young man from becoming a monk with the help of the Lotus Goddess and the Blue God. Despite his participation in the main roles of Nijinsky and Karsavina, \"The Blue God\" in 1912 failed in Diaghilev's entreprise, as it was set to the faded music of Reynaldo Khan. Andris Liepa replaced it with Alexander Scriabin's \"Divine Poem\", and Mikhail Fokin's unreleased choreography with a modern interpretation by Englishman Wen Eagling, but theater-goers and critics considered the new production a failure, while noting the outstanding work of artist Anna Nezhnaya in restoring costumes and decorations.
