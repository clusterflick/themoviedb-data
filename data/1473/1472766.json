Both princes suffer greatly from the role assigned to them of maintaining a world that is collapsing. And both endure childhood traumas in their relationships with their parents, which they will struggle with for the rest of their lives. Yet their goals and worldviews could not be more different – ​​the liberal Rudolf has a vision of a united Europe, while the conservative Wilhelm primarily wants to strengthen his own empire and rule authoritatively. A docudrama about two heirs to European imperial houses of the same age, but who follow completely different paths – for one, it culminates in personal triumph, for the other in tragedy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clash Of Crown Princes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1818211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Markus Freistätter","original_name":"Markus Freistätter","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":"/ubgOqJfaHFYwcVPt7sUn1KHAkXq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rudolf","credit_id":"68110b132e8ba022e480ec19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1720894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raphael Nicholas","original_name":"Raphael Nicholas","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/rO2ZkSIsdWr4YXmvlQTHBGOLe57.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Wilhelm","credit_id":"68110b21dde6e180f681317a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1279783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Rumpf","original_name":"Judith Rumpf","popularity":0.0949,"profile_path":"/yHKt5HgjqrFmeeYWu3GI6hU6on1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Vicky","credit_id":"68110b43a90acaf6eeeb1d16","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":572647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferry Öllinger","original_name":"Ferry Öllinger","popularity":0.1237,"profile_path":"/t7wUHoySnji1omp8pskMQHm5m2c.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Franz Joseph","credit_id":"68110b5ba90acaf6eeeb1d22","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5217934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Waldner","original_name":"Valentina Waldner","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mizzi Kaspar","credit_id":"68110b6a0c125a95530fecde","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2910517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Fertner","original_name":"Lisa Fertner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Salondame","credit_id":"68110b744603571ead0fdd42","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28920642","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
