A snowstorm hits, leaving the guests trapped and cut off from the world. No one’s unhappier about this than the Earl’s son and heir, Robert, the leader of a dangerous new political party. As the evening progresses, an attempt is made on Robert’s life and he is determined to find the culprit. Is it the jilted lover, the resentful cousin, the belittled butler, a mysterious guest?
