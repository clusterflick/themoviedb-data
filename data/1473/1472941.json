The documentary tells the story of each of them and how those stories transformed into a collective struggle that continues to this day. Absence is a recurring theme throughout the narrative. But, despite everything, the mothers managed to transform those absences into a powerful presence and the reason for their struggle, becoming the most active sector of the resistance against the dictatorship.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/edITREYteEQlrnWP47fQjXtEeWZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa침ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"La historia de las Madres de Plaza 25 de Mayo de Rosario","title":"Arder치 la memoria","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5405473,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eugenio Magliocca","original_name":"Eugenio Magliocca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6811656a926ed22d82616be9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1954241","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/edITREYteEQlrnWP47fQjXtEeWZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer \"Arder치 la Memoria.
