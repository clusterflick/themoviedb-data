He is joined by an Indian Runner Duck with autism, Fred, who creates beats with his beak, and the brown bear with Down Syndrome, Bearnice, who loves nothing more than dancing for the big crowd at the circus. They must defy the odds to save the mysterious circus panther, Shadowclaw, in the heart of New York City. Together, they must turn their differences into strengths, overcome their fears, and save the panther before the official K9 team captures her and puts her away forever.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":242614,"logo_path":null,"name":"Epsilon Film","origin_country":""},{"id":30092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parapictures Film Production","origin_country":""},{"id":177020,"logo_path":null,"name":"Falcon Features","origin_country":""},{"id":2526,"logo_path":"/kzIW6QWhacDwzGoXEIWhac8rb70.png","name":"Kickstart Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":228959,"logo_path":null,"name":"MOIN Filmförderung Hamburg Schleswig-Holstein","origin_country":""},{"id":98024,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film-Fernsehen-Autoren-Team GmbH","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":228927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Creative BC","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Dreamers – The Hunt for Shadowclaw","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5405069,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alison James","original_name":"Alison James","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6811333b0c125a95530ff631","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2429177,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Heiko Hentschel","original_name":"Heiko Hentschel","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6811335319292f098880e2a9","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Character Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43091,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Moreland","original_name":"Robert Moreland","popularity":0.12,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681133852e8ba022e480f521","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697618,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ulrich Schwarz","original_name":"Ulrich Schwarz","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681133c1a458c27761eab0da","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198399,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andreas Schneider","original_name":"Andreas Schneider","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681133d80c125a95530ff6b8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1642669,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas Baumgarten","original_name":"Thomas Baumgarten","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681133eda458c27761eab135","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arno Hazebroek","original_name":"Arno Hazebroek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/iiSSY3e47QYWsYTzuGkpiowkQ6m.jpg","credit_id":"681133fb2ce920d0bd80d110","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
