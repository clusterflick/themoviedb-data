Beekind gives insight on the nature of the honeybee as a member of the colony, their interactions and relationships to each other and to humans, as we look within, and take one big sustainable step back. We're welcomed into Circling Hawk, the business and home of Gregg and Michelle Scott, our owners and operators, and caretakers of the 25 acres of land. Alongside their two protégés Julia and John, we are taken on their journey as stewards, artists, and guides to the life they lead at the apiary. A life of peace, love, and earthly balance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beekind to the little guy","title":"Beekind","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35684812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
