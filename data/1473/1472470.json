Introduction, progression, training, rope maneuvers, sequence of movements, equipment, and high-level practice—everything you want to know about climbing. Accessing the vertical world means learning to read the rock, combining positioning, balance, and self-control, and having fun. Demonstrations by Jean-Christophe Lafaille (high mountain guide) take place in the dizzying scenery of the Vercors cliffs (Presles and Corrençon-en-Vercors) and the Dentelles de Montmirail. Jean-Pierre Bouvier, known as \"Mouche,\" takes you to the magical boulders of Fontainebleau, while François Legrand (world champion on climbing walls) gives you his advice on how to progress.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4HmgRqBQxc6CSGAztKEOjZtZNmT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":260723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pan Art Vision","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Climbing - Discovery & Initiation","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3786023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Bouvier","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Bouvier","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/xYycLmnRTs0hdBeg53q4e2DvC9E.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"681050fedde6e180f681138d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3999723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Christophe Lafaille","original_name":"Jean-Christophe Lafaille","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":"/7mCyShPQRQVAUqdZRGSLiABhXI7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"681051200c125a95530fc789","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1403348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Legrand","original_name":"François Legrand","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/reh4lIX1oCe7aIyVdzOUi7TEAd4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68105131dde6e180f68113a6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5079660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Meauxsoone","original_name":"Guy Meauxsoone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/eMKlOQLkXnItZBXCRjIF6WT801t.jpg","credit_id":"68104d065ad0b67c66eafb31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5079660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Meauxsoone","original_name":"Guy Meauxsoone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/eMKlOQLkXnItZBXCRjIF6WT801t.jpg","credit_id":"68104d492137f34c24eaafeb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36733111","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nNSCC6nEF2SqQ1C4ca7V31cRxeX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4HmgRqBQxc6CSGAztKEOjZtZNmT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
