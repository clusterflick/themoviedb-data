He faces challenges as each tradesman he encounters requires different goods in exchange. Eventually, they come up with the idea of using precious metals as a common medium of exchange, leading to the creation of coins. This new system simplifies trading, allowing the fisherman to sell his fish for money and easily purchase what he needs.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":47906,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stephen Bosustow Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":260648,"logo_path":null,"name":"Learning Corporation of America","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why We Use Money, or the Fisherman Who Needed a Knife","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1219700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Clark","original_name":"Steve Clark","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680f66ebeb1d4b06de0f91c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1326907","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
