Roque’s videos explore the tensions between the natural and the constructed, often blurring the lines between what is visible and what is obscured. In several of the works on view, the moon appears as a guiding light and offers direction amidst the darker sides of paradise. Roque illuminates joy and communion within his work, often casting characters from the LGBTQ+ community in Brazil, such as dancers, drag queens, and other personas. Within the landscape of his imagination, queerness is not just a form of identity but a horizon—a space between times, a cosmic paradise.
