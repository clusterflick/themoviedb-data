Do we know what our Savior looked like? The film The Face of Jesus explores two acheiropoietic images—sacred cloths not made by human hands—the Shroud of Turin and the Veil of Manoppello, as well as the most extraordinary depiction of Jesus painted by human hands: the Vilnius image of the Merciful Jesus. Filmmakers take the audience on a cinematic journey to the tomb in Jerusalem from 2,000 years ago, to Rome, Manoppello, and San Giovanni Rotondo, to discover what our Savior looked like. After the main feature, learn about the devotion to the Holy Face with a bonus featuring U.S. clergy who detail the power of the ancient devotion and why it’s gaining traction among the faithful in modern times.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Face of Jesus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
