Finding herself at 35 in an age of incessantly and increasingly fraught gender politics, Grace feels both more exposed and less seen than ever. Join her as she explores what butch identity means in a world moving beyond labels, and tries to work out where it, and she, belong in the new frontline of queer liberation. Sounds funny, right?  No stranger to comedy, Grace has appeared on BBC Radio 4’s The Now Show and smash hit podcast The Guilty Feminist, and has long since earned a reputation as the folk scene’s funniest lesbian. Her eagerly-awaited standup debut has been a long time coming – and was a runaway success at 2022’s Edinburgh Festival.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grace Petrie - Butch Ado About Nothing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5365520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Petrie","original_name":"Grace Petrie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"680f7bd7930c895e280f8ee5","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
