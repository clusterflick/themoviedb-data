The resultant movie is a conversation about how we internalize our climate emergency, letting mortalities large and small emerge only when the night puts our guard down. Inspired by the San Francisco Bay, dreams, and novelist Octavia Butler's vision of a future California. This film embraces the aesthetics of a crumbling society – expired and cast off film, backyard developing, hand cranked camera – because it is a premonition, a goodbye, and a last look over the shoulder.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"In the Maritime Frequencies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1627834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greta Snider","original_name":"Greta Snider","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/mcBwm32z4fy4bG4X7DrntlPytW9.jpg","credit_id":"680fe3f4930c895e280fa014","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
