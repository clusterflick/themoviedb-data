Jess, a young English-speaking photographer, goes to an abandoned downtown loft to document a queer party. While she's having fun with her friends Kevin, Mélie, and Diane, the party is suddenly interrupted by yet another police raid targeting the community. Jess then points her camera at the police: for no apparent reason, the officers charge the guests and brutalize the crowd with batons. As the community mobilizes to denounce the injustice, Jess and Diane join the movement and try to convince the newspapers to publish the incriminating photos, aware that they have in their hands a media bombshell that could change everything.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":161085,"logo_path":"/qCg1T2dQhud8z1g3Yr980dCPqNI.png","name":"Le foyer films","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":313,"logo_path":"/rx5CT9wUnEz0AcdpcX9epujv7nw.png","name":"TS Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Arsenal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pier-Philippe Chevigny","original_name":"Pier-Philippe Chevigny","popularity":0.1602,"profile_path":"/gO50xO4YrazOojtq6sURe8jCKNw.jpg","credit_id":"680fe5db930c895e280fa08e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pier-Philippe Chevigny","original_name":"Pier-Philippe Chevigny","popularity":0.1602,"profile_path":"/gO50xO4YrazOojtq6sURe8jCKNw.jpg","credit_id":"680fe5df4603571ead0fa795","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1169091,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chloé Robichaud","original_name":"Chloé Robichaud","popularity":0.0883,"profile_path":"/8M6C4KZktdQ4AweInUgs8Jk7LO5.jpg","credit_id":"680fe5ea4603571ead0fa7a0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":796,"name":"police brutality"},{"id":250606,"name":"queer"},{"id":348565,"name":"lgbtqia+"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
