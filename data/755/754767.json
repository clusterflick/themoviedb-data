They are both from Bologna, but travel all over the country to sell their goods. Not without success, because all these years they have always won the deluxe vacation the company bestows on its best salesmen. With the firm footing the bill, they have travelled to various remote corners of the globe: they went on a safari in Kenya, rode camels in Saudi Arabia and visited temples in Asia. This year, they are going to Cuba. We meet the two gentlemen through the man who has been filming them on their excursions for the past 15 years.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/b1CwuNTt2dO5kA7MnD2MCaa9iMJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pierrot e la Rosa","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life as a Corporate Holiday","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914202,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Paolo Muran","original_name":"Paolo Muran","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8c88abcb80280039077edb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1489035,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gianluca Buelli","original_name":"Gianluca Buelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8c888c17c4430036d9b24c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914202,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Paolo Muran","original_name":"Paolo Muran","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8c8876397df0003857775c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2820363,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Milco Fabbri","original_name":"Milco Fabbri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8c889dce9e91003545048e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b1CwuNTt2dO5kA7MnD2MCaa9iMJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
