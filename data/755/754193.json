In the Philippines, there are about 3.3 million Filipinos afflicted with this “invisible” ailment, many of whom are afraid to admit it and deal with their condition for fear of being ostracized. Sometimes, warning signs are ignored and things end up tragically. In this full-length documentary, ABS-CBN hopes to destigmatize mental health by taking a more optimistic approach with stories of recovery and redemption.","popularity":0.3422,"poster_path":"/uv5YYC0ij3JCepgREXiZC7MS2u7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141333,"logo_path":null,"name":"ABS-CBN News and Current
