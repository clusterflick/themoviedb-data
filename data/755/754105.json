This film precedes the serial movies that will follow.  Nevertheless, the repetition is already very present for this film inspired by the music: that of John Cale, emblematic of my own passage from the rock aesthetics (Velvet Underground, Lou Reed, ...) to the minimal American music of La Monte Young, Philip Glass and Steve Reich whose composition processes will orchestrate upcoming films. Filmed with a Pathé Webo DS 8mm camera, the reel was shot several times in the camera in a series of layers of images overprint shot in Paris, Nanterre, La Défense and in the Perche. The filmic matter is apprehended in its thickness; I was very impressed by the film HYNNINGEN by Werner Nekes and Dore O.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/r4GkxgXOattXXaVSVFXUOTt9M4t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"98","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2993499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Sacy","original_name":"Christian Sacy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"603b6fbe798e060050dcc278","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2993500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Gottin","original_name":"Daniel Gottin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"603b6fc74bfa540050b97692","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2993503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frédéric de Lozère","original_name":"Frédéric de Lozère","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"603b6ff992e55b0050ff25cb","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2122795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Michel Bouhours","original_name":"Jean-Michel Bouhours","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a4b03391b9c00374b6b13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r4GkxgXOattXXaVSVFXUOTt9M4t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
