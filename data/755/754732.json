Encased within three vacuum-sealed bell jars it may not look like much, but it is one of the most important objects on the planet. It affects nearly every aspect of our lives from the moment we are born, to the food we eat, the cars we drive, and even the medicines we take. The Last Artifact follows the high-stakes race to redefine the weight of the world reveals the untold story of one of the most important objects on the planet. The kilogram, the base unit of mass in the International System of Units, helped send humans to the moon and satellites into space. This small hunk of metal is the object against which all others are measured. Yet over time, its mass mysteriously eroded by the weight of an eyelash. A change that, unbeknownst to most, unleashed a crisis with potentially dire consequences.","popularity":0.8758,"poster_path":"/uo53z2TiKKENfzsPwc6SzC0GLfv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":225276,"logo_path":null,"name":"KUSM-TV","origin_country":""},{"id":106458,"logo_path":null,"name":"Montana PBS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Artifact","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Measuring Mass: The Last Artefact","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Margolyes","original_name":"Miriam Margolyes","popularity":1.3188,"profile_path":"/q73xMZveDogt3e5uFknWMExLIyH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (UK version)","credit_id":"6144e08e2b531d00624555c2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaime Jacobson","original_name":"Jaime Jacobson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b98ab4356a710061db6399","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaime Jacobson","original_name":"Jaime Jacobson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b98ac43d43e013f79dd6ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2207637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed Watkins","original_name":"Ed Watkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b98b677304b5135b7e0622","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2207637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed Watkins","original_name":"Ed Watkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b98b72356a710061db6444","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2207637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed Watkins","original_name":"Ed Watkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660eadf5d6dbba014a6fb03f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2535832,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aaron Pruitt","original_name":"Aaron Pruitt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660eae426dc507017e57ad39","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982051,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stefanie Watkins","original_name":"Stefanie Watkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660eaea115dea0016235007a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13124120","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/55ZzyFze3h9MRRrptCanUVLg1pJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1875},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uo53z2TiKKENfzsPwc6SzC0GLfv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6012,"name":"physics"},{"id":230695,"name":"science knowledge"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
