As the exotic, mysterious Mata Hari, she became one of the most famous dancers of her day. She travelled throughout Europe and had a network of lovers everywhere, which made her an ideal spy during World War I. She was accused – rightly or wrongly – of being a double agent, and she died in front of a French firing squad in 1917.","popularity":0.2104,"poster_path":"/dBqUGqvEuyoIj6weypaFY0getxI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215508,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dutch National
