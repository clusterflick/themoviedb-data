Created by the extremely successful Jewish-Czech composer Jaromír Weinberger, Spring Storms was premiered in Berlin just ten days before the National Socialists seized power. The curtain soon fell permanently and irrevocably on this idiosyncratic operetta. Now, 87 years later, it will be lifted again for Barrie Kosky’s new production.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5BRtdAfPIwVYmqqipNQ3dic0RP2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weinberger: Spring Storms","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":839,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5BRtdAfPIwVYmqqipNQ3dic0RP2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":592}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
