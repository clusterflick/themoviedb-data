According to the director: “When I was 19 I set out, hoping I could learn the meaning of life by ‘experiencing everything’. I bought a car for 20 marks in a cafe in Ulm. I spray painted it yellow and green and drove it from Holland to Romania to Spain, sleeping in the back seat in a red blanket. Driving down to Málaga, at the crest of the mountains, the brakes went out. As the car sped down the mountain then crashed, I lost consciousness, followed by three days and nights of visions. What did I see, what did I understand? The Shaykh al-Akbar, Sufi mystic and philosopher Ibn ‘Arabî , writes that the journey only has true meaning if it brings a new beginning. In traveling, the heart becomes the goal of the journey”.","popularity":0.0639,"poster_path":"/eoEcc5AAEJmtMCt7gmCLZtvzUmv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kitâb al-isfâr: Book of the Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Κιτάμπ αλ-ισφάρ: Το Βιβλίο του Ταξιδιού","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Bauermeister","original_name":"Mary Bauermeister","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/lNvAmJRWd51FmJFJWIyYRY311yX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8a19192667780037e329e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Gril","original_name":"Denis Gril","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8a191f1443f40039c9d3a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ximena Kilroe","original_name":"Ximena Kilroe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8a1926a135330036139910","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidi Saïd","original_name":"Sidi Saïd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f8a195d2667780039e0e579","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baba Hillman","original_name":"Baba Hillman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a198e2667780039e0e62d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baba Hillman","original_name":"Baba Hillman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a19811443f40039c9d483","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baba Hillman","original_name":"Baba Hillman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a1933a14bef0036b7b33a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baba Hillman","original_name":"Baba Hillman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a19528d2f8d003696e374","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baba Hillman","original_name":"Baba Hillman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a1975e9da690038e8eaa1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Baba Hillman","original_name":"Baba Hillman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a193f2667780036e20e60","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12782656","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l3gRjzsE37z2BngLPsw7k20CSSe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1176},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eoEcc5AAEJmtMCt7gmCLZtvzUmv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FIDMarseille International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
