These include: bi-packing with a strip of clear leader sewn with sequins, creating paper mattes of circles and text, and multiple exposures with more custom mattes, photographed with one actor (Aj Cesena) on a simple set. These processes required six passes through the camera. The roll was then rephotographed on an optical printer and extended to its current run time of 8 minutes. The soundtrack is made up of chopped and manipulated laugh tracks and audience sounds.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/oiZeax2xzTYGOVAeuAu7LCGBxA6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Mystic is sitting across from himself and gazing into a crystal ball.
