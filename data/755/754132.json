Those who had arrived as babies had never learned to walk, to dress, or to feed themselves. This documentary follows the young Greek medics who moved in to reform the asylum. They were astonished at the determination of the children, some of who had been chained to their beds for years, to improve their lives. A model ward was set up, and children were unchained. Within months some, like Andreas, were able to play games outside for the first time in their lives.","popularity":0.0707,"poster_path":"/jz6nam9sW5jNqcvWhE3FdRG8tjq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gabriel Productions Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1992-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Children Of Leros","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Τα Παιδιά Της Λέρου","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1073155,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexis Grivas","original_name":"Alexis Grivas","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6446a0bf0582245923328c9e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552017,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yannis Drakoularakos","original_name":"Γιάννης Δρακουλαράκος","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6446a0cab3f6f5049c9fac52","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane Gabriel","original_name":"Jane Gabriel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a5b30391b9c00364bd106","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane Gabriel","original_name":"Jane Gabriel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a5b351443f40038c6badf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817924,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dan de Waal","original_name":"Dan de Waal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a5b5da13533003614805f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817925,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter O'Connor","original_name":"Peter O'Connor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a5b6c2667780036e2eb0d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1620640,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yannis Haralambidis","original_name":"Γιάννης Χαραλαμπίδης","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a5b78f6fd180035b7926c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jz6nam9sW5jNqcvWhE3FdRG8tjq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
