Being in the union we realised that we should be allowed to live decently.” There have been calls for the abolition of child labour for years, but this film follows working children in the slums of Delhi and Bangalore who are demanding the right to work. They are forming unions and challenging authorities as they try to take control of their own lives. “They never ask us as working children what our problems are because they don’t want to know the truth.”","popularity":0.0632,"poster_path":"/rufEPTIj069sEFFSUcmRwVWKCKw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whose Life Is It Anyway?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1234274,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robert Moore","original_name":"Robert Moore","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a56a423851300373c88b8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane Gabriel","original_name":"Jane Gabriel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a568b8d2f8d0038954689","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1579621,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sam Gracey","original_name":"Sam Gracey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a569439549a0036b7a69c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane Gabriel","original_name":"Jane Gabriel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a5685f6fd180035b77e03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rufEPTIj069sEFFSUcmRwVWKCKw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
