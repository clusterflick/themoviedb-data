The word \"anima\" from which animation is derived, as we all know, means \"to breathe life into\". And \"life\" means \"limited time\" and that there could be an approach that does not include any of the aforementioned \"three elements\".  The result of several years of exploring new methods was an \"animated film\" that eschews the so-called \"animated\" structure. This film aims to visualize \"shifting consciousness\" through a method of filming in which approximately 5,000 pencil drawings are constantly overlapped\"","popularity":0.0546,"poster_path":"/hE9KimRombzoN7SG1WEYPhtwsTz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141916,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mistral Japan","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2017-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MATIERICA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1063264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keita Kurosaka","original_name":"黒坂圭太","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/r89PRoxQqk2ZyGDWOfV164Xwl9e.jpg","credit_id":"64289e310f3655011078d3a8","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3989705,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Yukio Hiruma","original_name":"Yukio Hiruma","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64289de901b1ca00777aa9dc","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817651,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yoshiaki Mizu","original_name":"Yoshiaki Mizu","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a1303a135330037129289","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1063264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keita Kurosaka","original_name":"黒坂圭太","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/r89PRoxQqk2ZyGDWOfV164Xwl9e.jpg","credit_id":"5f8a12f0a14bef0036b7a7dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":960132,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Haruyuki Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木治行","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a13201443f40039c9bcc5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7vTe2PEfXy4v17D1JNNdUog8YEg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hE9KimRombzoN7SG1WEYPhtwsTz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"No Language\", \"english_name\"=>\"No Language\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"xx\", \"native_name\"=>\"No Language\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"マチェーリカ／予告編","key":"416335918","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-05-09T04:16:04.000Z","id":"5f8a12813af92900384defae"}]}}}
