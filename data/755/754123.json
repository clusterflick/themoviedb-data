After working in McDonalds, Jane Gabriel was given full access to film the McDonalds outlet which held the world record for the amount of money taken in one hour, and to Hamburger University in London. This observational documentary reveals why McDonald employees run, and how the shouting and the “warm fuzzies” and “cold pricklies” affect the employees. They describe what it’s like inside McDonalds as it plans to open a new McDonalds in the UK every mile for the next 25 years.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/2hol6pP5qzzlja0PAhrVAhyRLl1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":141928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gabriel Productions Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1988-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Every Mile!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Ένα Σε Κάθε Μίλι!","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane Gabriel","original_name":"Jane Gabriel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a575d2667780037e42cec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane Gabriel","original_name":"Jane Gabriel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a5762a14bef0036b8509b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1479379,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mike Thomson","original_name":"Mike Thomson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a576b1443f40039cae9ed","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817928,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Lyte","original_name":"John Lyte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a5774a14bef0035b88fbf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007061,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bob Withey","original_name":"Bob Withey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8a5781d4b9d900382ed3d2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2hol6pP5qzzlja0PAhrVAhyRLl1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
