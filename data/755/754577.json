All children (actors and actresses) who work in the movie are residents in the community Vila Torres, an at-risk area in Curitiba. They were chosen after a theater classes for children held in that community as part as the film project.  Most of the residents of this community live from the collection and recycling of garbage in the city of Curitiba.  The story shows three children (two boys and a girl), in the mid-thirties, setting up a movie frame projection room. They build a projector with an empty shoe box with two holes with the size of a film frame. Inside the box they put a burnt-out bulb without its filament and filled with water. This bulb is used as a lens. Children had to wait until the bulb burned out. Those electrical bulbs were rare in those days.","popularity":0.045,"poster_path":"/wRB30YgxdKPUi5Vca9WaOwKFMcg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2020-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2819805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthonny Vinicius","original_name":"Anthonny Vinicius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Anthonny","credit_id":"5f8bcfe5fe077a003932efe6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2819806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Henrique","original_name":"Victor Henrique","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Victor","credit_id":"5f8bd018202e1100374c2377","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2819807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ketlyn Taynara","original_name":"Ketlyn Taynara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ketlyn","credit_id":"5f8bd02c1fb94f003534177b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2819808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melo Viana","original_name":"Melo Viana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8bd04ffe077a003932f250","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2819808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melo Viana","original_name":"Melo Viana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8bd058d05a030035dccd84","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2614403,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sandra Zawadzki","original_name":"Sandra Zawadzki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8bd072392712003a2684ed","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2819811,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jussara Locatelli","original_name":"Jussara Locatelli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8bd09ee9da690039eba2c6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2118817,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lúcio Kodato","original_name":"Lúcio Kodato","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"600a3f2b2d531a005664413f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12279160","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wRB30YgxdKPUi5Vca9WaOwKFMcg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Portuguese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Portuguese\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"pt\", \"native_name\"=>\"Portuguese\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
