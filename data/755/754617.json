Weaving the past with the present, the film spans between personal stories as it interacts with historical events, ultimately leading to the decline of a great art form.","popularity":0.4766,"poster_path":"/vvVNc4VdPv5i8fBcLnEwTNnF9l4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2009-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other Song","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1788830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saba Dewan","original_name":"Saba Dewan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5f8bf2c6cb80280038043d45","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3152553,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rizvan ul Haq","original_name":"Rizvan ul Haq","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e9923883ee67004600c04d","department":"Production","job":"Research Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1988089,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shikha Makan","original_name":"Shikha Makan","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e9924822e48000300a2e16","department":"Production","job":"Research Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1788830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saba Dewan","original_name":"Saba Dewan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8bf144a1353300351b6b29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1788831,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rahul Roy","original_name":"Rahul Roy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8bf1bffe077a003732cdf2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1760058,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Reena Mohan","original_name":"Reena Mohan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/qe8zhN98txiFF1cMkYEET6l5WYP.jpg","credit_id":"5f8bf1e990fca3003609052b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309123,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Khushboo Agarwal","original_name":"Khushboo Agarwal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8bf1f690fca300380a806b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1752849,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mahadeb Shi","original_name":"Mahadeb Shi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8bf209cf1afd0036dedc99","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521932,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anupama Chandra","original_name":"Anupama Chandra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8bf21d3927120038272ed9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1760058,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Reena Mohan","original_name":"Reena Mohan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/qe8zhN98txiFF1cMkYEET6l5WYP.jpg","credit_id":"5f8bf233a1353300351b6f3d","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1788830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saba Dewan","original_name":"Saba Dewan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8bf24e1fb94f003833f734","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1788831,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rahul Roy","original_name":"Rahul Roy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f8bf2b4ecbde9003b740688","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1519658","wikidata_id":"Q7755593","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vvVNc4VdPv5i8fBcLnEwTNnF9l4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":4178,"name":"courtesan"},{"id":4471,"name":"varanasi"},{"id":209365,"name":"history of india"},{"id":261423,"name":"uttar pradesh"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
