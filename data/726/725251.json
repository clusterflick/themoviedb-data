It is characterized by being a group composition, typically in the presence of judges and an audience, with poets rapidly contributing stanzas such that each new stanza addresses only the previous stanza; there is no overarching plot development, and the overall structure is a chain, not a conventional, linear narrative… In 1989, I had the great privilege to be involved in a film renga that was produced in the graduate film seminar led by Nathaniel Dorsky at the San Francisco Art Institute.” —Eric Theise","popularity":0.2043,"poster_path":"/8yXj9eRa6iAoJtfCwd1tjkI2mwZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Renga","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1071582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathaniel Dorsky","original_name":"Nathaniel Dorsky","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/dhJc7fXL8eQovtm6wMQb9cQZY7j.jpg","credit_id":"5f11fb762afb250033385a06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2715387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dena Penniston","original_name":"Dena Penniston","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f11fc8db87aec003619e3e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2715383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bud Lassiter","original_name":"Bud Lassiter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f11fbbd1d78f200321e8c83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2715379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Anderson","original_name":"Erik Anderson","popularity":0.1266,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f11fb4365c26c0037b5c49a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2715381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Baker","original_name":"Paul Baker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f11fb6565c26c0037b5c4ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2715382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kurt Easterwood","original_name":"Kurt Easterwood","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f11fba6b87aec003519c904","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2715390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Tempest","original_name":"Kim Tempest","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f11fcaf22e4800035680a6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1626538,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geoffrey Luck","original_name":"Geoffrey Luck","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f11fc6943d9b10037583fe0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":220691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Poitras","original_name":"Laura Poitras","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/gRCQMBVyEy7FlA6MAUJ0ESVobLp.jpg","credit_id":"5f11fc9db87aec003519c988","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1745346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Theise","original_name":"Eric Theise","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f11fccab87aec003319e8f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2715386,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Mukamal","original_name":"Alan Mukamal","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f11fc7c22e4800037684182","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John McGeehan","original_name":"John McGeehan","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f13a9ea1d78f2003322a98e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8yXj9eRa6iAoJtfCwd1tjkI2mwZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":3,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w8gfnaQqoPcOTKIDZdVzqIYadiA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kCKrvWybgVzG3dTAamzh7XRvGna.jpg","vote_average":0.958,"vote_count":4,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zDNFGSG6snUTl2ztFguNqyqTE8h.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":854},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xpuFEYvQXKnQ9TaCwT0suCuQLAb.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
