The Perseus, a British Parthian-class vessel built in 1929, was sunk by depth charges dropped from an Italian ship during a mission. On the submarine was a crew of 59 plus two passengers, one of whom was 31-year-old Navy stoker John Hawtrey Capes. When the sub sank, Capes washed up on the shore of Kefalonia, and for 18 months he hid behind enemy lines, hoping for a rescue that might never come.","popularity":0.0468,"poster_path":"/5sHfDal8fM9qnmTsxLETRhjyYOg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maximus Distributions Ltd","origin_country":""},{"id":131552,"logo_path":null,"name":"AQ Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Perseus Survivor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1943051,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sergey Machilsky","original_name":"Сергей Мачильский","popularity":0.1506,"profile_path":"/iNaXbVlGylrb89HqnXM7UApRVvJ.jpg","credit_id":"61c1ad568b959e0043419f65","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2587275,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evgeny Tomashov","original_name":"Evgeny Tomashov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c1ad4c2ac4990019197880","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2587275,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evgeny Tomashov","original_name":"Evgeny Tomashov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1488951c6aa70034861cbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6935414","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dudj4nET87Im7WKZevNxu6KWEM3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5sHfDal8fM9qnmTsxLETRhjyYOg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1142},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4UPjmxSP6OI9D00rVM4qnt76Ef1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"World premiere at the International Shipwreck Festival 2019 - https://www.festiwalwrakowy.com/en/","release_date":"2019-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Perseus Survivor [DARK WATERS] Trailer","key":"gHFNZIB97L8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-03-14T10:12:31.000Z","id":"5f1488e5d465370034670316"}]}}}
