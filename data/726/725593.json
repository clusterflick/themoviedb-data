Inspired by the texts of Edward W. Said, the poems of Mahmoud Darwish and Verdi’s opera Aida, the film depicts in a metaphoric form current issues of cultural identity, loss and the pressures to conform. With no dialogue, the film is backed by a musical excerpt from Aida whose lyrics express the difficulties of being loyal to one’s country and cultural identity. The personal and urban transformation tackles on issues of identity, loss and disorientation as a result of historical colonialism and contemporary globalization.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nothing Escapes My Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiam Abbass","original_name":"Hiam Abbass","popularity":0.5805,"profile_path":"/hkzC5aJKTiuCchBpybaHDVngYZW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Women","credit_id":"5f13664678570e003457b813","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florian Korter","original_name":"Florian Korter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Old Man","credit_id":"5f1366c3d46537003563bfc2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716521,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patrick Delsing","original_name":"Patrick Delsing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f13676c1d78f20033222f33","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2274475,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ari Benjamin Meyers","original_name":"Ari Benjamin Meyers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1368b64083b3003503c4c3","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716525,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Patrick Delsing","original_name":"Patrick Delsing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1369044083b30037039bd3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2280769,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nigel Hetherington","original_name":"Nigel Hetherington","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1368701c6aa70034812be6","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Krippendorff","original_name":"David Krippendorff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1366ed65c26c0037baf6f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716524,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Manu Alexander Lübke","original_name":"Manu Alexander Lübke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f13689265c26c0036b8f2cc","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Krippendorff","original_name":"David Krippendorff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1367061c6aa700357f6eed","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716520,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Krippendorff","original_name":"David Krippendorff","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1367322afb2500363a3b96","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1985650,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tobias von dem Borne","original_name":"Tobias von dem Borne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6034d4b8c6006d003cbad0e6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3783296","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"St. Louis International Film Festival, U.S.A.","release_date":"2015-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
