When his star athlete is caught eating candy before the meet, the coach has no choice but to remove him from the squad. However, as the big meet approaches, the coach, too, toys with the idea of eating candy. In a surreal hallucination, the coach is visited by the “Spirit of Candy,” who liberates him from his misperception that candy isn’t healthy.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":137327,"logo_path":null,"name":"R.P.
