That speaks to how difficult it is just to get into orbit. Next, consider how far away the moon is from the Earth: 240,000 miles. Since the alleged moon landings, no country even claims to have gone more than 400 miles from Earth and that was in the Space Shuttle. The International Space Station orbits at 200 miles above Earth. There is a big difference between 240,000 miles and 400 miles. Why can’t anyone make it more than 400 miles from Earth today if we could make a 480,000 mile round trip in 1969?","popularity":0.0503,"poster_path":"/lm2KeJSFSp5OcUO7BleWBTw73bT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apollo Zero","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2215562","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lm2KeJSFSp5OcUO7BleWBTw73bT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":857}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
