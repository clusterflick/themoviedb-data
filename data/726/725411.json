From the artistsâ€™ statement: Anathema re-imagines the microscopic behavior of liquid crystals undergoing turbulence as a sentient entity that possesses the fingertips and the eyes enthralled by the LCD touch-screens of communicative capitalism. Anathema can be understood as an object-oriented video that isolates and recombines the magical gestures of dream factory capitalism. By bringing the telecommunicating couplings of mother-father-daughter-son-machines and boyfriend-girlfriend-units into contact with the conductive imagery of liquid crystallization, Anathema proposes itself as a prototype for a counter-spell assembled from the possible worlds of capitalist sorcery.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3Ig7GSRyG93Tl1BWLkbZo7mOmhM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anathema","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Ig7GSRyG93Tl1BWLkbZo7mOmhM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vjJauQLcAeCyjwYqC29IdglKu2l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
