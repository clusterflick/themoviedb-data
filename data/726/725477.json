Homage to Airwaytakes its starting point in a 1920s photograph depicting the dog Airway, who was part pet, part lab animal to two anaesthesiologists. Their tests on Airway led to the development of a device which serves to open the patient’s airways. The invention became known as Guedel’s Airway, named after both the doctor and dog involved.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xhW4r60emuauPzIBUV3mYFXBdt1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2019-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homage to Airway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2716149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophia Ioannou Gjerding","original_name":"Sophia Ioannou Gjerding","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1312a365c26c0037ba8a41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xhW4r60emuauPzIBUV3mYFXBdt1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kLA6xLre4nrdNTFwvtW5Sh9RVJa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Ecrã","release_date":"2020-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARoS Aarhus Art Museum","release_date":"2019-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
