Formally seductive, and challenging to decipher, this \"ecological fantasy\" (for the lack of a more precise definition) transforms a botanical garden into a laboratory of evocative images and sounds, in a process that could be identified as alchemy.","popularity":0.0613,"poster_path":"/6N1oF2qxaenOwh9ZVVKR7fowwoe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1737260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Atoosa Pour Hosseini","original_name":"Atoosa Pour Hosseini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1515163852020036d272bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8352714","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jEo7EQ806ovoqUdt0LteilsfhcH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6N1oF2qxaenOwh9ZVVKR7fowwoe.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
