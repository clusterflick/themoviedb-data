He meets Gail Ormsby, the owner of the neighboring Box K Ranch, and the two are immediately attracted to each other. Ira Todd, Gail's crooked foreman, fills her head with lies about Lee, whom she unjustly comes to hate. In a pitched battle between the men from Enchanted Hill and those from the Box K, Todd's men are routed. Lee then learns that Todd (in league with a banker who knows that there is gold on Lee's land) has attempted to frighten him off by means of the repeated attacks. The law steps in, and Lee and Gail renew their courtship.
