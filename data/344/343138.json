This is not so surprising, coming from an artist who has lived in Berlin since 1979, a city inextricably bound up with WW II. Armando has always been fascinated by this period in history, that has determined his youth, and he is directly inspired by the history of Berlin. By showing documentary pictures of the war, the camera shoots the landscapes of Armando's paintings and the ideas behind them. The film records the construction of an immense flag, made of grey clay, and shows its function through authentic images. Armando expresses his interpretations of the past in an aesthetic way. Armando is a portrait of an engaged person, a film as he himself probably would have made it: associative, personal, but also aloof, as an interpretation of a period of time.","popularity":0.1259,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":54833,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moskito Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Armando","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1473926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armando","original_name":"Armando","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/wImUH7X1UysM6FX5zS0Xcsik2bJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55709c19c3a368709c000615","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":558636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maartje Seyferth","original_name":"Maartje Seyferth","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/9KG9mocHKtUpApKxq9Pcg78vWwR.jpg","credit_id":"5570707892514108660025a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":558637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Nieuwenhuijs","original_name":"Victor Nieuwenhuijs","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5570706ac3a3687f0c00176e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0287315","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
