The film is a simple observation of a group of staff and teenage pupils in the corridors, art rooms, exclusion room, and an empty classroom used as a makeshift mosque. With panoramic views of London, the seventh floor is a place of partial escape where the relative freedom of activity and empty space are the questionable outcomes of a disintegrating education system.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seventh Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1473887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Lucas","original_name":"Anna Lucas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55706638925141326c002246","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
