Through interviews, local artists discuss Flo's impact on the community and the small queer movement that was instigated around the FOSAJ Art Center in Jacmel where he was working at the time of his death. The filmmaker's poetic, personal narration is told from the perspective of a close friend and collaborative partner with whom McGarrell was co-directing a film based on the novel, Kathy Goes to Haiti (Kathy Acker, 1978).","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/a5Azxze4jEbgX83L8QBoAeHtJq2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peace of Mind","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cary Cronenwett","original_name":"Cary Cronenwett","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557705f8c3a36839660001ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3996340","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pUM8pp0dKIAqBgmjwykS4R8qtFv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2pk2MEBZJYrBl547unb2XP5egq6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/a5Azxze4jEbgX83L8QBoAeHtJq2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
