This film tells the story of their difficult relationship, seen from the perspective of the younger brother, who is not afraid to dish up a good share of self-mockery. “My brother thinks that once in a lifetime, everyone should take apart an engine block,” we hear him say in the voiceover. Next, we see Wout grapple with a towel and a pile of engine parts, while his older brother irritably lectures him from a distance. When Wout scales the slopes of the Himalayas with his camera, he comes to the point of making an important decision about his life.","popularity":0.1946,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":54890,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nederlandse Filmacademie","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Turn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joost Conijn","original_name":"Joost Conijn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"557190b9c3a368368e00165a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474203,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wout Conijn","original_name":"Wout Conijn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"557190c09251410872004848","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474205,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karel May","original_name":"Karel May","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557190d7c3a36839200017dc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474203,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wout Conijn","original_name":"Wout Conijn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557190629251415e77000c36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1210054","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":380,"name":"sibling relationship"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
