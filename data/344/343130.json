Yoav recalls his first encounter with Pasolini’s Teorema, back when he was still a soldier in the Israeli army. Nadav Lapid has created an alter ego director. In just a few scenes, Lapid condenses the moments that have ultimately altered the director’s life. Lama? is an extremely personal film that tangibly illuminates the vast potential inherent in cinema.","popularity":0.1397,"poster_path":"/oAbg3P8Y1V9ZnZyFudcYdz1caFk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why?","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1473888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliviér Tournaud","original_name":"Oliviér Tournaud","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"557066f8925141326c002262","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1269662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomer Sharon","original_name":"Tomer Sharon","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"557066ff925141326c002266","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3744515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Moreshset","original_name":"Daniel Moreshset","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/ihDoIpkI5P60pKlwaxrxnWG6VSV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"557067059251410861002415","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1011135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nadav Lapid","original_name":"Nadav Lapid","popularity":0.3021,"profile_path":"/w2d3Wty19GGOEhN7CqlSdvLQxIq.jpg","credit_id":"557066e7c3a3681073002526","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4433412","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oAbg3P8Y1V9ZnZyFudcYdz1caFk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":852},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8yFdPZOLD5k9iH1jY0jabs6Cibp.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1414},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bfpoSLptRg9ZH4FRPCEBhm2kJjD.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
