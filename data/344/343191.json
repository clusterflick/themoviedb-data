It wouldn't be such a problem if they didn't work in neighboring retail shops and have to see each other every day. Meanwhile, something weird is going on with the residents of their small town. Some of them are getting sick, others are acting a little less human and a lot more like robots. Can Mona and Jules set aside their relationship drama long enough to avoid the body snatching invaders?","popularity":0.2792,"poster_path":"/qlo0mWdB6beCh1SyyZLvFfxDzqU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54862,"logo_path":null,"name":"Obscurely Irrelevant Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"They're not paid enough to deal with this.","title":"Probable Robot","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1474004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Mack","original_name":"Julia Mack","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mona","credit_id":"5570dd9bc3a3681068002f6e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giselle Marie","original_name":"Giselle Marie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jules","credit_id":"5570dda4c3a36810560036f6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Hovan","original_name":"Jeremy Hovan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mac","credit_id":"5570ddc89251410872003199","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1474008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Medina","original_name":"Jonathan Medina","popularity":0.2667,"profile_path":"/es90kItvUMGxJqI3dRuruWoAwMJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sander","credit_id":"5570ddd29251416c2d00079f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cynthia Johnson","original_name":"Cynthia Johnson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Bianca","credit_id":"5570dddd92514140ca002524","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juicee Couture","original_name":"Juicee Couture","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5570ddec925141326c002f45","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Pieniaszek","original_name":"James Pieniaszek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Larry","credit_id":"5570ddf892514140ca00252b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Decker","original_name":"Emily Decker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Nick","credit_id":"5570deb692514108720031d8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.
