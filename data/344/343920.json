That he was even champion was a bit of a surprise. He’d taken the title with an upset of Ezzard Charles the year before. Marciano on the other hand, was the coming star. He’d hammered Joe Louis into retirement in 1951, a sad fight that many saw as a changing of the guard. Fans were eager to see the Rock take on Jersey Joe—but few expected to witness one of the all-time great heavyweight fights.","popularity":0.3743,"poster_path":"/6OuYusA3DoCdSvWHjS1ncjnBVCe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60,"logo_path":"/4YldLvCWQL9VIAHQ2Fu3Ffkh9Si.png","name":"United Artists","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rocky Marciano vs. Joe Walcott","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":990578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rocky Marciano","original_name":"Rocky Marciano","popularity":0.1731,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5576249c9251413f3a005009","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jersey Joe Walcott","original_name":"Jersey Joe Walcott","popularity":0.151,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"557624adc3a368569a002cfb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Powers","original_name":"Jimmy Powers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"557626509251413f3a005032","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475523,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nathan L.
