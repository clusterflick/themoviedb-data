His son does well until he's sent out on his own to claim an accident victim. Instead, he's asked by a friend of the dying man to help with CPR. Taken aback, he assents, the dying man is resuscitated, and Death's son is in the doghouse with dad. Enraged, pop gives his son 24 hours to deliver a corpse, so the young man sets out to ice the man who asked him for help earlier that day. Junior's target is a young actor, Tom, going through opening night and loved by Sarah, a rather histrionic young woman. A near-Death experience awaits them all as Junior comes of age.","popularity":0.386,"poster_path":"/TejyuvJj6JEbswmxYC1kVyDK2v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16099,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology (IADT)","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":241774,"logo_path":null,"name":"The National Film School at IADT","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1999-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At Death's Door","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cillian Murphy","original_name":"Cillian Murphy","popularity":7.457,"profile_path":"/llkbyWKwpfowZ6C8peBjIV9jj99.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Young Reaper","credit_id":"556fb59fc3a368105900104a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith McErlean","original_name":"Keith McErlean","popularity":0.2323,"profile_path":"/rkSrF2jGZRIt4iwS1qIB967mTM4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"6385e1cf2e069702a804f5fb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1694939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Des Keogh","original_name":"Des Keogh","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":"/7C68JpYZEaUVfDU92QiAnpDraBu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Father Reaper","credit_id":"64ce2a00303c85011dd38539","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3971666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niall O'Siordáin","original_name":"Niall O'Siordáin","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Bouncer","credit_id":"6772dd476234c1b46f6155ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":78549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eoin Whelan","original_name":"Eoin Whelan","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Doctor in Hospital 3","credit_id":"67d8165aebc30a0b480166ee","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2169283,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Conor Morrissey","original_name":"Conor Morrissey","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6385e1c05ed8e90083f75b72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2169283,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Conor Morrissey","original_name":"Conor Morrissey","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6385e1c31b157d00c9f99542","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0299492","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/TejyuvJj6JEbswmxYC1kVyDK2v.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1302,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/veL2yXiXbdCKW63Gv9QVbzYUwsZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":868}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
