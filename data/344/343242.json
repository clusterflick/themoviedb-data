Ngor","overview":"When Dr. Haing S. Ngor was forced into labor camps by the Khmer Rouge, little did he know he would escape years of torture and recreate his experiences in a film that would win him an Academy AwardÂ®. \"The Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S. Ngor\" tells the dramatic story about arguably the most recognizable survivor of the Cambodian genocide, a man who became a worldwide ambassador for justice in his homeland, only to be murdered in a Los Angeles Chinatown alley - a case still muddled with conspiracy theories. Through an inspired blend of original animation and rare archival material - anchored by Ngor's richly layered autobiography - the years encapsulating the Khmer Rouge's tyrannical rule over Cambodia are experienced though a politically charged transnational journey of loss and reconciliation.","popularity":0.5693,"poster_path":"/pXGUbugfi5rYHACpe8fnPDTGQVi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161552,"logo_path":null,"name":"DeepFocus Productions Inc.","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Khmer","iso_639_1":"km","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Killing Fields of Dr. Haing S.
