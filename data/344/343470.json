As the colours glow and change across their bodies and wings it is as if the genetic programme of millions of years is taking place in a few minutes. It is a rampant creation that seems to defy the explanations of evolutionists and fundamentalists. It is like a mescalin dream of Charles Darwin's.  The film is inspired by the insect collection of Walter Linsenmaier in the natural history museum of Luzern. As each insect follows the other, frame by frame, they appear to unfurl their antennae, scuttle along, or flap their wings as if trying to escape the pinions which attach them forever in their display cases. Just for a moment the eye is tricked into believing that these dead creatures still live . . .","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":105281,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ancient Mariner Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"While Darwin Sleeps...","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170336,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Bush","original_name":"Paul Bush","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/460eNBHQFhUXkZ4emgD62MDuKKT.jpg","credit_id":"557304bf925141318e0022ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":547960,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andy Cowton","original_name":"Andy Cowton","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b14bde0c3a3685333006b20","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3321386","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
