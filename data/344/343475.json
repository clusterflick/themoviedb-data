The construction vocational school holds a name-giving ceremony, thus calling the attention of its supervisory organ to itself. The school-master distributes as well as receives presents from the sponsoring factory, and the pupils sit for a written examination of unheard-of material. The results are devastating, which the despotic school-master attempts to conceal by a staged disciplinary procedure.","popularity":0.1798,"poster_path":"/5nbUEnQ1bwsMF66BaxhEy8lErfo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8100,"logo_path":"/1HuVRo0SYPSzYvduxVf4baaWqOI.png","name":"Mafilm","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1976-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spider Football","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"József Madaras","original_name":"József Madaras","popularity":0.1747,"profile_path":"/woLOiBxoXELKVmhj5CvhXlZmkkF.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Igazgató","credit_id":"557308f5c3a3686f580019ef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajhona Ádám","original_name":"Rajhona Ádám","popularity":0.0884,"profile_path":"/nKkqe3HpCBOhrypjci7vD9Ng09s.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lengyel Pál","credit_id":"557308fe9251411161002628","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1260012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judit Halász","original_name":"Judit Halász","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/fo3CyqilQ8xS8P9Azx1bNXd79F9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lengyelné,Éva,magyartanár","credit_id":"55730907c3a36870940019d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Róbert Koltai","original_name":"Róbert Koltai","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/kICjJBJpA5JFUMDyWjaLnMyAWXD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tornatanár","credit_id":"5573091092514115ee001a6c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":560237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ildikó Pécsi","original_name":"Ildikó Pécsi","popularity":0.1702,"profile_path":"/ue6q3RKFXTwcRQPVcaCJbrmdwXE.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pelikán anyuka","credit_id":"557309169251411161002631","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"János Rózsa","original_name":"János Rózsa","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55730934925141456e000331","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044274,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"István Kardos","original_name":"István Kardos","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557309419251412e2600125f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"János Rózsa","original_name":"János Rózsa","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5573092a9251412e2600125b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":70918,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zsuzsa Csákány","original_name":"Zsuzsa Csákány","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"590282d5c3a368288b0003e8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1571615,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"János Bródy","original_name":"János Bródy","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/mdyGH6ymcbavFA8uAPhw8V1pOe3.jpg","credit_id":"590282c8c3a36828b80003c4","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667497,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Nagy Vilmos","original_name":"Nagy Vilmos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"590282db9251413e0f00042e","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1602703,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Nelly Vágó","original_name":"Nelly Vágó","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"590282e3c3a368291d0003c6","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23614,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Elemér Ragályi","original_name":"Elemér Ragályi","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/A6kDNvOUArNUN3rEexEAQbmtiQ0.jpg","credit_id":"590282bb9251413e1d000417","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0075080","wikidata_id":"Q55718707","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":2175,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/5nbUEnQ1bwsMF66BaxhEy8lErfo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1446}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
