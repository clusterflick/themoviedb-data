Films of this genre gave the Finnish cinema and the viewing public one of its most popular characters – the lumberjack (tukkijatka, tukkipoika, tukkilainen) who at his most heroic hour becomes the log-roller or the shooter of rapids (koskenlaskija). The significance of this character in Finnish film is comparable to that of the Cowboy on American cinema. He is the pioneer, the wanderer, the adventurer. He negotiates the frontier, he is an embodiment of the conflict between wilderness and civilization.","popularity":0.221,"poster_path":"/4PJEdFEQ4JDy7M8oeSDdaUy02cj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21046,"logo_path":"/ghVwr2Y0DgRbg3b4Mm3FVdhJ6Fo.png","name":"Suomi-Filmi","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1928-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tukkijoella","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Stockflötarna","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"On the Log River","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1136513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Urho Somersalmi","original_name":"Urho Somersalmi","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/mbsESEXHvSIuyBbk717s1jQFBFY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Aaprami Turkka","credit_id":"5572dd8f92514115ee001628","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1474521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Sylvin","original_name":"Ellen Sylvin","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/6yBF9O8RI4cx6OEVFUPzkCQP2dw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Katri Pietola","credit_id":"5572dd99925141116100218d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1474522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Hannikainen","original_name":"Mary Hannikainen","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/l5yawFh9y518olTg6iIchCK5xVb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Anni","credit_id":"5572dda39251411161002194","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1288475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirsti Suonio","original_name":"Kirsti Suonio","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/kIJh4ybRsaNLA2yptbixUVfXHPO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maija Rivakka","credit_id":"5572ddadc3a3686f58001631","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1474525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eino Salmela","original_name":"Eino Salmela","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Antti Huhtanen","credit_id":"5572ddcac3a3686b7d001159","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1289111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paavo Kostioja","original_name":"Paavo Kostioja","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Huotari","credit_id":"5572ddd392514115ee001631","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1474195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ossi Korhonen","original_name":"Ossi Korhonen","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/teIKoHvbBemRAuxcfu0Z2ZhQmDf.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Pölhö-Kustaa","credit_id":"5572dddf9251416af70037bc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1474526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heikki Välisalmi","original_name":"Heikki Välisalmi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/1QTRybkj9Sb8B6DRKqA2suiHPDf.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Heikki Tolari","credit_id":"5572dde9c3a3683920003f8c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1474527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emil Lindh","original_name":"Emil Lindh","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"J.
