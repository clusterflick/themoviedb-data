Webster, who was born in Kansas City in 1909, was a unique personality in the world of jazz and blues. In the thirties, he played with all the great names. During his Amsterdam period, he stayed with an elderly landlady, Mrs Hardloper, with whom he appeared on a national talk show. In conversations with Van der Keuken, he muses on the past; on the fantastic experience of playing in the renowned Duke Ellington band; or on one of his best friends, who was so deft at eating with a knife and fork. Short, fragmented remarks, which Van der Keuken has edited in a loose, improvised editing style.","popularity":0.0967,"poster_path":"/i5WturdfIzWY5kg3pnWL6LmO3W7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29459,"logo_path":"/el8phAL6Xa6vXvvaQNiELmEOgx8.png","name":"VARA","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Ben: Ben Webster in Europe","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Byas","original_name":"Don Byas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"55742d729251413aa000056e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michiel de Ruyter","original_name":"Michiel de Ruyter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55742d79c3a368246a001164","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rob Langereis","original_name":"Rob Langereis","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55742d829251412e26003330","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Parsons","original_name":"Jimmy Parsons","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"55742d89c3a36823b9001290","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cees Slings","original_name":"Cees Slings","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"55742d90c3a368234e00158c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan van der Keuken","original_name":"Johan van der Keuken","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/zPqpgZaXeXe02OFiiikL5kg58RP.jpg","credit_id":"55742da0c3a36824d80015c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0189390","wikidata_id":"Q47155623","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i5WturdfIzWY5kg3pnWL6LmO3W7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":833}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1416,"name":"jazz"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
