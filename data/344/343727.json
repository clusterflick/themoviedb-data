It might have been the 1985 Mississippi State Bulldogs, who produced four Major League Baseball All-Stars. Two of them, Bobby Thigpen and Jeff Brantley, became Relievers of the Year, while the other two, Will Clark and Rafael Palmeiro, formed the imposing one-two hitting punch known as \"Thunder and Lightning.\" The brash and bold Clark was born in New Orleans, the son of a pool hustler, while the soft-spoken and shy Palmeiro was a son of Cuban immigrants who did his talking at the plate. As teammates at Mississippi State, they nearly propelled the Bulldogs to a College World Series title. Thirty years later, director Rory Karpf revisits those fabled Bulldogs, tracks the complicated relationship between Clark and Palmeiro, and brings closure to men who should be remembered for what they did, and not for what they didn't do.","popularity":0.5156,"poster_path":"/ofrcMYT5T6NCYsMOirAxeinSBxZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55062,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Row Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thunder and Lightning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rafael Palmeiro","original_name":"Rafael Palmeiro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"557456d09251413f660016e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1474972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Clark","original_name":"Will Clark","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"557456f2c3a368246a00153f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":151052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rory Karpf","original_name":"Rory Karpf","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557457109251413efe0018d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4530566","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ppHDiWs3xQx6bq5xVLc3bQEdFMl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mnCV3FMwHm1znO12YeTUBOuuBz4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ofrcMYT5T6NCYsMOirAxeinSBxZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":0.748,"height":991,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hO2AXY1uCe3QqLPA1PgM2ypJUH2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":741},{"aspect_ratio":0.748,"height":991,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A7wWVkXZaIImGBMo1NpLKaUjIY7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":741},{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":990,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xOcMWK6fydfXnRNs0KEd8uzjepY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":653}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":787,"name":"mississippi river"},{"id":1480,"name":"baseball"},{"id":3616,"name":"college"},{"id":189924,"name":"world series"},{"id":198244,"name":"chicago cubs"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
