Regler tells about her failed first marriage, the agreement she had to stay until the children were grown (but to see other lovers) which resulted in the true love she found with her second husband and renowned writer Gustav Regler, who later died a tragic death in India. The love affairs are historically rooted in the political and technological developments 20th century, and are narratively based in a complex sound/image structure. Interludes (silent optically printed film passages narrated with inter-titles excerpted from her diaries, and early childhood memories) formalistically refer to early cinema. The footage in these passages is re-contextualized and interwoven metaphorically throughout the text.","popularity":0.1024,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Stories My Grandmother Tells","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1083198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gustav Regler","original_name":"Gustav Regler","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5572e1f5c3a36838d3003f24","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Regler","original_name":"Peggy Regler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5572e1fe9251412e26000e0c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dana Plays","original_name":"Dana Plays","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5572e20d9251416af7003816","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0462693","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
