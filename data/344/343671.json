With its precise beak and long pink legs the stilt is superbly adapted to the stony braided riverbeads of the McKenzie Country, but it is tragically unable to deal with new threats (rats, ferrets, habitat loss). An early doco for TVNZ’s Natural History Unit, the magnificently filmed drama of the stilt’s struggle for survival makes it “stand out as a classic of its genre” (Russell Campbell). It won the Gold Award at New York’s International Film & TV Festival (1984).","popularity":0.2543,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Black Stilt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","title":"Wild South: The Black Stilt","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3619620,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hal Smith","original_name":"Hal Smith","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cbae0c9566580f7a33f81b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389377,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rod Morris","original_name":"Rod Morris","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cbae1990b87e07565edc78","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3619621,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Watts","original_name":"David Watts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cbae2a4a4bfc00504a5ab0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389377,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rod Morris","original_name":"Rod Morris","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5573cefec3a368234c000b64","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
