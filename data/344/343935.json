They set out on a journey across the globe, putting the fate of their family in the hands of strangers.  Across borders, behind bars and onto a smuggler’s boat – the family chased freedom.  ‘Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea’ tells Zainab’s story, and the story of many others who have trodden the same path.  Jessie Taylor and Ali Reza Sadiqi travelled across Indonesia and met with 250 asylum seekers in jails, detention centres and hostels. Through candid interviews, hidden camera footage and in the words of asylum seekers themselves, the story of the ‘refugee’ is told. What pushes people to leave home? What do they leave behind? What do they fear? Why did they choose this path? And what does it take to turn someone into a ‘boat person’?  Meet the human faces behind the most controversial issue of our time.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/u1I25ode3rjgJRIRorLWSoksZNH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55312,"logo_path":null,"name":"Liquid Creations","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2011-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What turns a person into a boat person?","title":"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475750,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Schmidt","original_name":"David Schmidt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557789b9c3a368427500020d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475750,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Schmidt","original_name":"David Schmidt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"557789dfc3a36843080001d7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475751,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Kamen","original_name":"Chris Kamen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55778a0c9251413da00001d3","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475752,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jessie Taylor","original_name":"Jessie Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55778a2ac3a368427500021e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475753,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick van Cuylenburg","original_name":"Nick van Cuylenburg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55778a56925141372d00094a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":571122,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Byron Joel Scullin","original_name":"Byron Joel Scullin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55778acfc3a368427500024c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475750,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Schmidt","original_name":"David Schmidt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55778b17925141372d000973","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1475752,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jessie Taylor","original_name":"Jessie Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55778b45925141372d00097b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2042463","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1408,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u1I25ode3rjgJRIRorLWSoksZNH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
