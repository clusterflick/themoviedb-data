She struggles to get by with this teenager who gets deeper and deeper in violence and juvenile delinquency. Speaking sentimentally, things are not going better: the relationship with her lover has come to an end. It may seems depressing, but Marie doesn’t give up, even if love seems to be an inaccessible dream. But love, there is. We can feel the affection of this mother for her troublesome child, thanks to Mathilde Seigner, who gives an astonishing performance. A subtle directing, a strong and captivating story, in short: a must see.","popularity":0.4672,"poster_path":"/hJBjtzauF0411LV92ogT5m684Vd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57615,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poly-Son-Post-Production","origin_country":""},{"id":207,"logo_path":"/uskenzq65wJe0cT0D8StQI3hJnO.png","name":"Agat Films & Cie / Ex Nihilo","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Mother","video":false,"vote_average":5.476,"vote_count":21,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathilde Seigner","original_name":"Mathilde Seigner","popularity":0.4655,"profile_path":"/AiuFNfBOyWWuOygzgu6bNgXyoXU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"5572ab01925141318e001a78","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kacey Mottet Klein","original_name":"Kacey Mottet Klein","popularity":0.2767,"profile_path":"/ggOHPk5DHQzf9t4Qm4sohmtcNVf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Guillaume","credit_id":"558848669251416faf000240","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierfrancesco Favino","original_name":"Pierfrancesco Favino","popularity":0.8025,"profile_path":"/hedzgTKFKrSleWvLkBlANng8w4T.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pierre","credit_id":"5588487ac3a3680534000244","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1480403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salomé Dewaels","original_name":"Salomé Dewaels","popularity":0.1261,"profile_path":"/5kSCOwXCjs9QpJB0IfrWFXYBjin.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Suzanne","credit_id":"55884890c3a3680534000252","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1480404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fiona Hernout","original_name":"Fiona Hernout","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/xPgy7bfQvWUlaiOKNl0BYPCSvzd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lorianne","credit_id":"558848a6c3a368053400025d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenny Clève","original_name":"Jenny Clève","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":"/kARTsNVnGqINNE6JN6WF1KmV4JI.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Le grand-mère","credit_id":"558848ddc3a368052f000261","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1029292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Salée","original_name":"Catherine Salée","popularity":0.3143,"profile_path":"/4BpOijEiMFxSIDkBS3GNppxW5Yp.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Martine","credit_id":"558848f09251416fa10002bb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":549324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eloïse Charretier","original_name":"Eloïse Charretier","popularity":0.0761,"profile_path":"/mihdmt8YMaNxSWnkhRA4Z1QEsX5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"La vendeuse de patisserie","credit_id":"558849169251416fad000292","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":233489,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Carrière","original_name":"Christine Carrière","popularity":0.147,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5572aaf0925141318e001a75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3712054","wikidata_id":"Q21009516","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7swLPw9HcZKwL3a7DmUGvUUBFDb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":3.239,"height":247,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/49DOGnTkJ824KBK1l9Foq9d5QUQ.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hJBjtzauF0411LV92ogT5m684Vd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uzlo0IoQrXjBaLXlNsPr4dqoFJe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
