The charming portrait of this young girl is sublimated with incessant tender zooms in and out on her face and her discreet smile, to accordion music. Itâ€™s a portrait-film, a dream-like film that has no contemporary equivalent to its formal and symbolic content. It is not a declaration of love, but a brief moment of admiration for beauty and the noble side of human nature.","popularity":0.0412,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portraits of a Young Eastern-European Jewish Orphan Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aryan Kaganof","original_name":"Aryan Kaganof","popularity":0.0484,"profile_path":"/rUElkeHdGyUXje2Sl0ubwWNRKOj.jpg","credit_id":"59a6d98ec3a36829d0000198","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
