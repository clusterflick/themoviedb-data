He had to travel though all over Europe to numerous museums and private owners in order to film the works of art. In the work of the great painter, Haanstra recognizes his particular interest in man as an individual human being, cutting straight through all the religious motives. And Haanstra also wants to see Rembrandt as an individual.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/zIO4Ht5WjLh3y56SBuCkwFz4LMc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54889,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministerie van OC en W","origin_country":""},{"id":46991,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bert Haanstra Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1957-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rembrandt, Painter of Man","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Rembrandt","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Haanstra","original_name":"Bert Haanstra","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":"/eZ5IJ3iq95lntxhshy5dAmW4zn3.jpg","credit_id":"55718e509251416d08001600","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948623,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stanley Sayer","original_name":"Stanley Sayer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6718cda75d0de89042d8aaef","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513122,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Mul","original_name":"Jan Mul","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6718cdb0a4ac8a432c5bd3a4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0050892","wikidata_id":"Q3932402","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zIO4Ht5WjLh3y56SBuCkwFz4LMc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":528}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1957-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
