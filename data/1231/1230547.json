She collides with unruly experiences of adolescence – quinceañeras, Rio Grande river excursions, teen makeovers and beyond – that invite her to soak up the details of the home her brother adored and she ignored. What emerges is a playful dance between a personal and collective coming-of-age portrait of kids on the border and Robie herself as she rediscovers the possibilities of joy in the aftermath of grief.","popularity":0.6368,"poster_path":"/sO2SFUihReXtPzkKkwXndApB8dm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":218279,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ambiente
