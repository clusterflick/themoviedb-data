He grew up on a Game Reserve in South Africa that was created by his father, who had a dream to set up a Safari but to bring Wildlife back out of Captivity from around the World and back into the Wild. This documentary shares how it began and how Peter Meyer survived some incredible moments living in the Wild but dedicating his lessons in Life to the Wildlife and his father. It's moving, cinematically stunning and truly heartfelt telling a story that has been silent for over 35 years.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/yhflNjNMPcydQOnuaeMnrs4wKwk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boy from the Wild","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yhflNjNMPcydQOnuaeMnrs4wKwk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
