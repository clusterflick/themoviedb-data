Using this knowledge, I focus on recent events in American politics to test this rural-urban divide. I interview six participants, three from a rural community, two from an urban community, and one from a suburban community. In these interviews, and in a supplemental survey, I ask how these citizens feel about the 2020 election, the events of January 6th and the current state of American democracy. To fully showcase this research, I use these interviews to create a documentary . The interviews and survey illustrate that the rural-urban divide continues to be a good predictor of political opinion, with rural participants tending to be more forgiving of, or even uninterested in, the insurrection.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rrZORES6C5wkCgrZG4kvlRcPhSm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":218239,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mikola's","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"How one divide explains the events of January 6th","title":"The Division Among Us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4478206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Frank","original_name":"Jackson Frank","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65a1d2ee596a9101287cfb30","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4478207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Goff","original_name":"Michael Goff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65a1d2ffd4fe0401223c4e3d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4478132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nate Heiman","original_name":"Nate Heiman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65a1d30b596a9101257cfc14","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4478208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna Kenniburg","original_name":"Joanna Kenniburg","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65a1d321cc277c0122d7db84","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4478209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katie Weeks","original_name":"Katie Weeks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65a1d3325907de012eb49e16","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4478210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry West","original_name":"Jerry West","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65a1d34178570e0123f2609e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3696130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Baez","original_name":"Kim Baez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65a1d357549dda0125fe5bb4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3696127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seth Weeks","original_name":"Seth Weeks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65a1d368549dda0128fe5cbe","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3696124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Gargano","original_name":"Michael Gargano","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/x6yoenec29a3orVgFnhMkFLnK3A.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65a1d37be9da69012f13f9a1","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4478205,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kyle Licar","original_name":"Kyle Licar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a1d2d7d6d64d012ffbeae4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3696124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Gargano","original_name":"Michael Gargano","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/x6yoenec29a3orVgFnhMkFLnK3A.jpg","credit_id":"65a1d2971feac1012511b6b3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3696124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Gargano","original_name":"Michael Gargano","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/x6yoenec29a3orVgFnhMkFLnK3A.jpg","credit_id":"65a1d2b1d4fe0401223c4d28","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3696125,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Luke Wysoglad","original_name":"Luke Wysoglad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a1d2cd78570e012ff25f9e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3696124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Gargano","original_name":"Michael Gargano","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/x6yoenec29a3orVgFnhMkFLnK3A.jpg","credit_id":"65a1d289596a91012b7cfa7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rrZORES6C5wkCgrZG4kvlRcPhSm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
