When human remains are found alongside a variety of Roman artefacts, none of the team at Albion Archaeology see anything out of the ordinary. But once the bones are washed back at HQ, something highly unusual is uncovered: a nail through the heelbone of one of the individuals. Could this be evidence of a Roman crucifixion? When they do some research, they find that only one confirmed example has ever been unearthed before, discovered in the 1960s in Jerusalem. To find out more, they call in renowned Osteoarchaeologist Dr Corinne Duhig to investigate.","popularity":0.425,"poster_path":"/uT0s0FDR6htauBqXDpLPsY1r5H4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":115187,"logo_path":"/5UHtxjCUtb4Bjy30AazamhhRGZC.png","name":"Impossible Factual","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":158800,"logo_path":"/pGWvq9K7JpBSdXlpurfA6FsGlOh.png","name":"The WNET Group","origin_country":"US"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":225782,"logo_path":"/ekjsYFZjS6PGKgxk68rBAqpLzJ.png","name":"ZDF Studios","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cambridgeshire Crucifixion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Anatomy of a Crucifixion","type":"Alternate"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Secrets of the Dead: Death in Britannia","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3222102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena Wilson","original_name":"Helena Wilson","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/a06Ra2kqib8Xdzq31nl4bRQELGs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator -
