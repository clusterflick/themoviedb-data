Join Elmo, Abby, Cookie Monster, and more as they sing, play, and laugh their way from 1 to 20. Learning numbers has never been more funâ€”or more furry! Animations, songs, and other favorite moments from recent seasons make counting as easy as, well, 1, 2, 3! Learning numbers along with little ones are Elvis Costello who wants to count to 10 but is missing an important number, Feist who sings about her favorite number 4, and Liam Neeson who gets an acting lesson from The Count while they count to 20.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/nvp8jApmhrqohf3k3p2K6NVOmkB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sesame Street: Cool Counting Collection","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nvp8jApmhrqohf3k3p2K6NVOmkB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
