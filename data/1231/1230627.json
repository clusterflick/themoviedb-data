From the summits of the island to the luxuriant forests, passing by rivers, swamps, beaches and mangroves, the diversity of landscapes and ecosystems offers a wide variety of spectacular panoramas.  Even if it is very frequented by tourists and has many inhabited areas, the island of Guadeloupe is also the land of a discreet, almost invisible people: the animals. They knew how to find their place, near or far from humans. We know of their existence. We have sometimes seen them; we have often been close to them. But rarely really approached.  From the summits of the island to the depths of the ocean that surrounds it, this 100% wildlife film takes us to the most remarkable animals of Guadeloupe.","popularity":0.1418,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":122922,"logo_path":"/wkW5V9kMU4uwrJ9rEzJTOAtjDWX.png","name":"Cosmopolitis Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GP","name":"Guadaloupe"}],"release_date":"2019-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guadeloupe, from Summits to Ocean","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1872006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frantz Confiac","original_name":"Frantz Confiac","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65a2b1985690b50129b00a77","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2867391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rémi Laugier","original_name":"Rémi Laugier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a2b45f1f02750127085d3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29028598","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
