Furie: Fire Up the Carousel!","overview":"This full-length documentary examines the life and career of the Toronto-born filmmaker Sidney J. Furie, a journey that spans over 60 years, from Canada to London and finally to Hollywood. In the midst of the Furie's own remembrances, he directs two last personal projects, shot digitally on shoestring budgets, from the first solo scripts he has written since 1961. 'Drive Me to Vegas and Mars' is a comedy about aging and letting go, while 'Hannah Cohen' is a Holocaust-themed love story set and shot in Israel. Sidney J. Furie: Fire Up the Carousel is an intimate portrait of a unique, prolific, and quietly influential filmmaker, a man with an impressive resum√© who has stood behind the camera on great films such as The Ipcress File (1965), Lady Sings the Blues (1972), The Boys in Company C (1978), The Leather Boys (1964), The Entity (1982), The Appaloosa (1966), Little Fauss and Big Halsy (1970), and many others.","popularity":0.1275,"poster_path":"/hjgrdZX8eUSKwawpl4LalA60Sdj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's time to open the Furie File.","title":"Sidney J.
