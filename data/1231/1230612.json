It is the last touring repertory theatre company left in Spain, whose patriarchs, Luis and Aurora, are approaching 80 years old. At the same time, on this emotional journey, we are introduced to the supporting actors, such as Manuel Andrés oandAmparo Pacheco - also octogenarians - who live their profession with dignity and unwavering enthusiasm. In “Cómicos” the names of our protagonists do not appear on illuminated signs but they shine with their own light in a film that talks about passion, the passage of time and the thin line that separates triumph and failure.","popularity":0.1746,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":9970,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dacsa Produccions","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":10139,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Zanfoña Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cómicos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1489222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Andrés","original_name":"Manuel Andrés","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/wHZoxgkAV5aYkWKuDiFzTEUgabt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65a2a3a1238513012562775d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2107350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aurora González","original_name":"Aurora González","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65a2a3ae5690b5137fafe25c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2248619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amparo Pacheco","original_name":"Amparo Pacheco","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/AgP0zDTCldh29RmfWwyoskyYCoJ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65a2a3babc2cb300c601da64","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luisa Fernanda Gaona","original_name":"Luisa Fernanda Gaona","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"65a2a3ca266778012264113e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1023400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Arribas","original_name":"Marta Arribas","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a2a3175690b5137fafe236","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1023400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Arribas","original_name":"Marta Arribas","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a2a3295690b50129b0071f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4479180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana Pérez","original_name":"Ana Pérez","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a2a373a6a4c10131a46d7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3565963,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alberto Molina","original_name":"Alberto Molina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a2a38cb7b69d01283bff75","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
