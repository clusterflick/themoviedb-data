From 10:00 AM to 04:00 PM, a group of residents of the city of Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world, participated in the intense experience coordinated by Argentine filmmakers Fabio Junco and Julio Midú. The collective process allows participants to pitch ideas in the morning, vote on a story at noon, and immediately start filming expressly, with a camera and microphone. The collective work was titled: \"CHRISTMAS AT THE END OF THE WORLD\" and tells an attractive intersection of stories of families living in the extreme south of Argentina on a date as sensitive as Christmas.","popularity":0.0725,"poster_path":"/jFmiosQX0rM0ClMpURtkpp6l5YE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6458,"logo_path":"/eT4oMUK7ODM0vvZue8yq3Ojwqf8.png","name":"INCAA","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2015-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Navidad en el fin del mundo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jFmiosQX0rM0ClMpURtkpp6l5YE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
