This film celebrates the groundbreaking efforts of key figures, centering on Dr. Bertrhude Albert, Dr. Naismy-Mary Fleurant, architect Wideline Pierre, economist Etzer Emile as well as dedicated canal workers Milourie Sylfrard, Theodore Johnson and Joseph Pressoir — all guided by the investigative journey of Max Angie Clervil. It also serves as a commentary on the complexity of colonialism and borders, tracing the role that the Massacre River continues to play in the history of Ayiti.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5Zh1IFcHOrYHXDtYaAgjhziEpEN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":277548,"logo_path":null,"name":"Faces of
