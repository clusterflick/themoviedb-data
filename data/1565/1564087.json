However, their bond is shattered when Li Xulai’s same-sex partner—who is also his former university professor—dies by suicide, bringing all of Li’s hidden truths to light. Strained by this revelation, his sisters grow distant. Li Xulai returns alone to the hotel room where he once lived with his lover, only to encounter Yang Ling, the late professor’s wife. In an intimate conversation, as memories of the past resurface, they come to realize that one man’s death has awakened a deeper understanding of love—and the necessity of self-love—for those left behind.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pride Days","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5754225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"余婧瑶","original_name":"余婧瑶","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f1b0f4b81d2ba4fb74f66b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5754226,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"兰天","original_name":"兰天","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f1b0fda0f1ae98e9b22fe0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
