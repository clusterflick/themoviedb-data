James Christian struggled through the pain barrier after a recent accident to play the set, including performing on the guitar, after having fallen off a ladder and broken his wrist only days before.  Much of the set was devoted to their debut, with some exceptional musicianship from the likes of Lanny Cordola and Chuck Wright, with other tracks and closing with a Whitesnake cover.  Setlist: \"Sahara\", \"Chains of Love\", \"Love Don't Lie\" (Stan Bush cover), \"Pleasure Palace\", \"Talkin' 'Bout Love\", \"Edge of Your Life\", \"Mind Trip\", \"All Is Gone\", \"The Rapture\", \"I Wanna Be Loved\", \"Can't Find My Way Home\" (Blind Faith cover), \"Slip of the Tongue\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sHmqgcMMSkqmn85Rum6iG1AULoz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House Of Lords: Live at Firefest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"House Of Lords: Live In The UK","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5755553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Christian","original_name":"James Christian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xzixfaf26pzKJV7GfjeuU13rpgA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lead Vocals / Guitar","credit_id":"68f29ee339486f0e8659137e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2598043,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lanny Cordola","original_name":"Lanny Cordola","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Guitar","credit_id":"68f29ef8f852acba4d591455","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2308669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Wright","original_name":"Chuck Wright","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/anOGg5jPJuwMX7H33KTY64P6awE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"68f29f13aa0c3027ec591370","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2425775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Mary","original_name":"Ken Mary","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/xKklpolatAq2UTVC6iXwKKKaOAv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"68f2a10f5eec4b46a574fac4","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1102,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sHmqgcMMSkqmn85Rum6iG1AULoz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":735}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
