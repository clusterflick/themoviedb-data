When Hawthorne breaks protocol and vanishes into a mysterious portal, the city reels from unexplained phenomena. Lang is forced to navigate a collapsing reality as STARLING agents turn ruthless and the boundaries between dimensions begin to rupture. As transformations unfold and the city descends into chaos, both men confront forces beyond comprehension-shifting identities, spectral adversaries, and a growing sense that something vast and irreversible is approaching.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/y5lCJmDkUdBde346WR4ucNPmRSy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Experience the evolution of reality","title":"Pryanama","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5757931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Myles Oliver","original_name":"Myles Oliver","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f4386df95de79d1b4e6f6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38683446","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":2611,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y5lCJmDkUdBde346WR4ucNPmRSy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1956}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9887,"name":"surrealism"},{"id":11237,"name":"rotoscoping"},{"id":196544,"name":"motion capture"},{"id":275266,"name":"cgi-live action hybrid"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":322496,"name":"action"},{"id":357272,"name":"sci-fi"},{"id":359557,"name":"vfx"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Pryanama (2025) | Official Trailer 2","key":"GF-7IqhRbyE","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-07-24T00:31:11.000Z","id":"68f438398d9fa7fab6baf582"}]}}}
