Thirty years later, the world has changed again, but his timeless ballet has travelled around the world. In a French-style garden, the choreography draws us into the seduction games of the Grand Siècle and the Age of Enlightenment, appealing to our classical musical and literary imagination: famous works by Mozart, the Map of Tendre, Dangerous Liaisons. But Preljocaj breaks with tradition by introducing a contemporary soundtrack and a choreographic language composed of broken lines and sensual movements. Like the final pas de deux, where the bodies whirl around for a languorous kiss: a moment of grace that has become the signature of this ballet.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/mq3GEa1FFJ1VdtPaMrZ05439Fqx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paris Opera Ballet: Le Parc","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathieu Ganio","original_name":"Mathieu Ganio","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/v7juEj3KbobR7my9n6eT8aU818b.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68f1a800341aa4979adf705d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3031820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Renavand","original_name":"Alice Renavand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4qjJRZIuAzYH6I68e8ehREnDbDM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68f1a818bb06a999fb77d8f1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194122,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelin Preljocaj","original_name":"Angelin Preljocaj","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/hA68MYZ5GOBOsUcHbYKG2Y4V54J.jpg","credit_id":"68f1a8427b8ee5669dec57a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mq3GEa1FFJ1VdtPaMrZ05439Fqx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1993}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2026-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2026-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
