Between Two Rivers","overview":"EAST TO WEST is an exciting seven part series charting the birth and flourishing of civilization in the Near and Middle East, and its huge influence on the West.  EPISODE 1 - Belween Two Rivers  This episode follows the birth of civilisation in Anatolia and the Middle East. We go back to the very beginnings, when hunter-gatherers pause in Gobekli Tepe and start to build the world's first structures around 12,000 years ago. We follow the first stages of civilisation: the rise of agriculture, governance and writing in Mesopotamia.  We visit ancient Babylon (Iraq) and Mari (Syria) to explore the world's earliest cities.  The latter part of the episode explores Alexander's arrival in Troy and his conquest of the Persian Empire - a journey that made him realise what he owed to the East.  In Miletus remarkable new finds show that the Greek god Aphrodite began as the eastern god Ishtar.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bifRXpXcTXiEryjo37YdpPML7xf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21592,"logo_path":"/tjqSDOrtxKLKHKtGe7f5tL4226k.png","name":"Madman Entertainment","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":2818,"logo_path":null,"name":"SBS Independent","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The untold story of the modern world.","title":"1.
