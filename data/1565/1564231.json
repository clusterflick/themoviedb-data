Thus, a piece of wood that catches fire must emit a gradation of different colors as its temperature rises. Based on this hypothesis, a 16mm celluloid film is directly exposed to the radiation of a fire, without the mediation of an optical system.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wyeQB9BgQfajOmJ8SR7fNyHYQgo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film de feu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4315351,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Sorrentini Zibjan","original_name":"Jacques Sorrentini Zibjan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68f2288b3f2aa07e594d1fea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wyeQB9BgQfajOmJ8SR7fNyHYQgo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"27th FCDEP (Collectif Jeune Cinema) - Competition","release_date":"2025-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
