Most of the concert footage was taken from a show at the Los Angeles Universal Amphitheatre on 2 September 1974 (Also featured are excerpts from D.A. Pennebaker's concert film shot at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973). Cracked Actor is notable for being a source for footage of Bowie's ambitious Diamond Dogs tour, and also for showing Bowie's fragile mental state during this period.","popularity":0.7004,"poster_path":"/6NS4qWnZkyD3yXSnNvF9zvDcN8T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1975-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cracked Actor","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Cracked Actor - A Film about David Bowie","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Collector","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Bowie","original_name":"David Bowie","popularity":0.9542,"profile_path":"/qrqQJivS0zLzxZKfgNZnDtjbqpI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4cccc3a36847f823f0dd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Yentob","original_name":"Alan Yentob","popularity":0.4371,"profile_path":"/cE1TVynSWTO2iPcVcNwWNZt3wbN.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cccc3a36847f823f0e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Yentob","original_name":"Alan Yentob","popularity":0.4371,"profile_path":"/cE1TVynSWTO2iPcVcNwWNZt3wbN.jpg","credit_id":"5a49c98d9251415c98009a14","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.
