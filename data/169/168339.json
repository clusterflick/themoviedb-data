It follows the story of a migrant family from the demolition of their neighborhood to their on-going struggle for housing rights. The film takes a look at the city on a macro level and through the eyes of experts, going from the tops of mushrooming skyscrapers to the depths of the railway tunnel under the Bosphorous strait; from the historic neighborhoods in the south to the forests in the north; from isolated islands of poverty to the villas of the rich. It's an Istanbul going from 15 million to 30 million. It's an Istanbul going from 2 million cars to 8 million. It's the Istanbul of the future that will soon engulf the entire region. It's an Istanbul nobody has ever seen before.","popularity":0.3796,"poster_path":"/9dbicT9xVs73XZbq7mFE1i9jX0N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11680,"logo_path":"/thDuwlPhKqGkfPzk0qd6zIiSw4m.png","name":"Filmförderung Hamburg Schleswig-Holstein","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":13163,"logo_path":null,"name":"York Street Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ecumenopolis: City Without Limits","video":false,"vote_average":7.417,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1150140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Imre Azem","original_name":"Imre Azem","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ccac3a36847f823ebe7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1854524","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"tr","file_path":"/9dbicT9xVs73XZbq7mFE1i9jX0N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5733,"name":"turkey"},{"id":10533,"name":"urban sprawl"},{"id":161662,"name":"urban development"},{"id":178027,"name":"environmental destruction"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"İstanbul Film Festivali","release_date":"2011-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ECUMENOPOLIS - CITY WITHOUT LIMITS (Trailer)","key":"XEzqu_z9fRo","published_at":"2011-08-09T11:43:42.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec701c3a368544800a070"}]}}}
