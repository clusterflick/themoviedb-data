They developed their bikes through rigorous field-testing, often risking life and limb to do so. Some of these cyclists were Category-1 road racers looking for a new way to train during the off-season. Others were simply fun-loving hippies looking for a new way to commune with nature. Their early bikes were scavenged from dumpsters and junkyards. It was from these humble beginnings that a multi-billion dollar industry, a form of recreation for the masses, and an Olympic event, were born. These hefty steeds were affectionately known as Klunkerz.","popularity":0.3695,"poster_path":"/folsdIpbJY3uOyPVD5cZ82LnDAV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the late 1960s through the 1970s a group of cyclists in Northern California's Marin County turned the bicycle world upside-down by taking their adventures off-road.","title":"Klunkerz","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1511150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Fisher","original_name":"Gary Fisher","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5973d8479251415806005be9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1856364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Breeze","original_name":"Joe Breeze","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5973d5c392514157fb005cbd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1856373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Ritchey","original_name":"Tom Ritchey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5973da1cc3a3685ded006383","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1856371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Kelly","original_name":"Charlie Kelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5973d9b3c3a3685dba005656","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1856376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Sinyard","original_name":"Mike Sinyard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5973da87c3a3685ded006409","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1856394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wende Cragg","original_name":"Wende Cragg","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/zyx86Ab24vnt8K0h26tc1aVwRzA.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5973e30cc3a3685ded006c8a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1856397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Bonds","original_name":"Alan Bonds","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5973e82dc3a3685dba0062ef","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1856398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otis Guy","original_name":"Otis Guy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5973e85dc3a3685dba00632a","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1856379,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Billy Savage","original_name":"Billy Savage","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5973dbd7c3a3685dd8006d00","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1856379,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Billy Savage","original_name":"Billy Savage","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5973dbe4925141580600600a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1856379,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Billy Savage","original_name":"Billy Savage","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5973dbb392514157ec006433","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0907856","wikidata_id":"Q6421506","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/folsdIpbJY3uOyPVD5cZ82LnDAV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3797,"name":"bicycle"},{"id":10191,"name":"mountain biking"},{"id":163222,"name":"off road"},{"id":225410,"name":"hippies"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Klunkerz: A Film About Mountain Bike History","key":"h19n-5qIp78","published_at":"2009-03-25T18:20:51.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"597476a7c3a36842c200b3b3"}]}}}
