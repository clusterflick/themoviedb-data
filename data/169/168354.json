An \"active health insurance\", in which the insured directly take over everything including medical activities and thus save costs. A new currency that expires in a few weeks and therefore stimulates spending. Unemployed people who, as \"loan siblings\", are given a new job and a good life. The traffic therapy group that wants to make you understand the snake as a \"unitary organism\". A therapy office in the fresh air, which finally gives musty psychotherapy a healthy freedom. Color the world back into balance, at least in the parking lot. Or use humans as a self-sufficient source of energy. Or a tangibly equal democracy: All people attain the same eye level, an optimal 1.9m [via platform shoes].","popularity":0.3926,"poster_path":"/oWSYwBAMwtX7bmHuCakamAFA2Qe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Measures to Better the World","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Bach","original_name":"Christoph Bach","popularity":0.3441,"profile_path":"/DjyM6g981W3qiHQZl4PUvjM2OJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Götz Bechstein","credit_id":"567eeafe9251414d98000ba9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Finzi","original_name":"Samuel Finzi","popularity":0.2817,"profile_path":"/pCMO1RAgikPaCt9wTOBnSZ2iM2S.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hector Balasz","credit_id":"567eeb1bc3a3684be300adaf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Geisler-Bading","original_name":"Claudia Geisler-Bading","popularity":0.2227,"profile_path":"/lbWFuZ74lLkOyOldekjvmphCXcI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Renate Werlow","credit_id":"567eeb2f9251412e5200880e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1332833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseline Gassen","original_name":"Joseline Gassen","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Erzählerin","credit_id":"567eeb3f9251412e52008811","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Georg Schütte","original_name":"Jan Georg Schütte","popularity":0.1017,"profile_path":"/2D6fZlLQEKxsRbR7P1cNL9aJ69F.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Martin Bobiak","credit_id":"567eeb5cc3a3684bcc00b2e3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rainer Sellien","original_name":"Rainer Sellien","popularity":0.4073,"profile_path":"/w0UdFn6OP3gP0c1zixPjwgX6ANw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bernhard Werlow","credit_id":"567eeb6cc3a36828f500009b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Güldenberg","original_name":"Patrick Güldenberg","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/zdhlff9fgQghitehXFARz3EVqVK.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tim Hiller","credit_id":"5a8784530e0a26540c042493","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Krauss","original_name":"Daniel Krauss","popularity":0.1451,"profile_path":"/haHcr3LBb1qUTNHhayQDKf7gwmS.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dr. Martin Mercker","credit_id":"5a8784e80e0a26540c04253c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Mauff","original_name":"Max Mauff","popularity":0.4992,"profile_path":"/iLbPfx8jKCWKxYkh27yVgJTmHQB.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"David Krüger","credit_id":"5a8784f7c3a36863e7042f3e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peer Martiny","original_name":"Peer Martiny","popularity":0.1503,"profile_path":"/kgNQXT9dYsOPU0192PKYtqLbP0M.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Bernd Kusminski","credit_id":"5a8785070e0a26545304896d","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Nickl","original_name":"Andreas Nickl","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":"/jX60elmIypF5HTOpAoLAmZybV2E.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Rolf Tiede","credit_id":"5a87851a0e0a2653db049954","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harald Schrott","original_name":"Harald Schrott","popularity":0.2359,"profile_path":"/eiwhK2Fao3aSw2NYwnPbTCm85gm.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Friedrich Krüger","credit_id":"5a87852f0e0a2653db049972","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jörn Hintzer","original_name":"Jörn Hintzer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"567eeaeb92514132db008501","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0466191","wikidata_id":"Q1680389","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oWSYwBAMwtX7bmHuCakamAFA2Qe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
