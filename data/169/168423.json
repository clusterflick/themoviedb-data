Yoga is known to go back to God Shiva, who perfected 8,4 million postures, according to Indian tradition. Far less known is the fact that yoga is at the same time an early 20th century-creation of Indian savant T. Krishnamacharya, which is what this film is about. Krishnamacharya's life and teachings are seen through the eyes of the director on his search for authentic yoga. His journey leads him from students and relatives of Krishnamacharya's such as the legendary teachers Iyengar and Pattabhi Jois to the source of modern yoga: the palace of the Maharaja of Mysore, where Krishnamacharya founded the first ever yoga school. A feature-length documentary including rare historical footage as well as lavish reenactments.","popularity":0.223,"poster_path":"/nu9Asj2o0LYlbqqYTJQWZPhVyMt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breath of the Gods","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Schmidt-Garre","original_name":"Jan Schmidt-Garre","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cccc3a36847f823f20b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2102302","wikidata_id":"Q1198315","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nu9Asj2o0LYlbqqYTJQWZPhVyMt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1128}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5828,"name":"yoga"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
