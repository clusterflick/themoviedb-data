Kate Smith and Sally Blane play sisters; assorted relatives live with the sisters, but everyone at home, and in the whole town, depends on Kate to hold everything together. The power company wants to build a dam which will require flooding many of the farms; Kate is holding out; if Kate sells, everyone else will sell; if Kate refuses, the rest of the town will refuse as well. Randolph Scott meets Kate's beautiful sister, Sally Blane, at a dance. Randolph Scott, as it turns out, is an agent for the power company. Kate thinks he's just using Sally; Sally believes that he truly likes her. Randolph comes to the farm and appears to woo Kate. Kate remains unconvinced about selling out, but falls for Randolph.","popularity":0.8348,"poster_path":"/AvuH0MBCOmiz57Qd1HKXWjZiH9m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She's in the Movies Now!","title":"Hello, Everybody!","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":214869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Smith","original_name":"Kate Smith","popularity":0.1846,"profile_path":"/zR7FaPmIqy62VUkrAjVU4TC9iKU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kate Smith","credit_id":"52fe4cccc3a36847f823f30f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randolph Scott","original_name":"Randolph Scott","popularity":0.5976,"profile_path":"/r46XgQMSRVwmQLn3NhUseU32ZuW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hunt Blake","credit_id":"52fe4cccc3a36847f823f313","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Blane","original_name":"Sally Blane","popularity":0.2867,"profile_path":"/eHiKKSoeYMIy55IhUcnhl7qeJAA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lily Smith","credit_id":"52fe4cccc3a36847f823f317","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Grapewin","original_name":"Charley Grapewin","popularity":0.4917,"profile_path":"/xROPwMkTUgweYQFhbTsvklIMhlw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jed","credit_id":"52fe4cccc3a36847f823f31b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Barbier","original_name":"George Barbier","popularity":0.249,"profile_path":"/dhBDURtUCsFayX2Zx1rglLYgqN1.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mr. Blair","credit_id":"62abacd0d4d509005150f040","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wade Boteler","original_name":"Wade Boteler","popularity":0.1518,"profile_path":"/mPvA7aaDLlMl1qksm1z8KRsDZyV.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Parker","credit_id":"62abad115ad76b00efe80672","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1033217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Swayne Gordon","original_name":"Julia Swayne Gordon","popularity":0.1407,"profile_path":"/9xKPzh1DDCLFFh78c7l9SsOGe5r.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mrs. Smith","credit_id":"62abad223009aa00525b0768","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erville Alderson","original_name":"Erville Alderson","popularity":0.2856,"profile_path":"/mlrduJuut47E82jiTsSw74LtY3i.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Horton","credit_id":"62abad31c7176d0061eaef91","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William B.
