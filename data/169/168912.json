In 2010, Jean-Marie Straub returned to the eastern provinces of France, this time to Alsace, to film the second half of a diptych based on Barrès’s work. The text is derived from In the Service of Germany, a book about the mountain of Saint-Odile, which Barrès wrote in 1903. With Joseph Rottner in the principal role, Straub traces the path of a young country doctor as he tours Mont Saint-Odile, following the routes that Barrès himself took to the chateau of Ratsamhausen and around the ruins of the ancient fortification known as the \"Pagan Wall,” which are unique in the area. Straub, himself born in Metz, plays the role of a resident of Lorraine whom the young Alsatian engages in conversation.","popularity":0.1417,"poster_path":"/98M05HPfQdDnjlg3N4iDlJFkqDD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34217,"logo_path":"/48h1xtqNLfHHalF8UNrZdQxSdZI.png","name":"Jeonju International Film Festival","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2012-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un héritier","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"An Heir","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Marie Straub","original_name":"Jean-Marie Straub","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/y6a7HQ2UK12p5bhP90KbRvu3mX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64cce156764b9900ae128049","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1969313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Rottner","original_name":"Joseph Rottner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64cce1632f266b09ec5efa41","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":66231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Ulrich","original_name":"Barbara Ulrich","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"64cce16943cd5400e27d1002","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933546,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Un-seong Yoo","original_name":"Un-seong Yoo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e38e5065e0a20139ffa72b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Marie Straub","original_name":"Jean-Marie Straub","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/y6a7HQ2UK12p5bhP90KbRvu3mX.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cd8c3a36847f8241441","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2075427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurizio Buquicchio","original_name":"Maurizio Buquicchio","popularity":0.0268,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668e48103baebeeedd9ed32c","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Marie Straub","original_name":"Jean-Marie Straub","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/y6a7HQ2UK12p5bhP90KbRvu3mX.jpg","credit_id":"64cce115706e5600c9a12859","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19054,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Renato Berta","original_name":"Renato Berta","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/fXjRoyeehudjs0kqsMv5yBt7b0U.jpg","credit_id":"64cce130764b99011df5d72b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":551787,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Catherine Quesemand","original_name":"Catherine Quesemand","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cce357764b9900c6385c4f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305191,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maurice Barrès","original_name":"Maurice Barrès","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cce129e04d8a3aab19f18c","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1206957,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christophe Clavert","original_name":"Christophe Clavert","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cce139798e06013a067783","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1834729,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dimitry Haulet","original_name":"Dimitry Haulet","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cce149e04d8a3aa7adeee8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2006899","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/98M05HPfQdDnjlg3N4iDlJFkqDD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
