He's alternatively sensitive and brutal with Kristen, who wants a sexual relationship that he explosively rejects. Late one night, as he's closing the cafe where he works, a young Black man attempts to rob him at gun point but faints from illness. Seth takes the man, Knowledge, an escapee from a nearby prison, to a family cabin where he nurses him and they begin a tentative friendship. When the sheriff learns of Seth's harboring a fugitive, a confrontation looms. Relationships between fathers and their children dominate the subplots.","popularity":0.7274,"poster_path":"/pmaJCkKTiH7YOkF822mLeaSDgur.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parallel Sons","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Sons Paralelos","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Hijos paralelos","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Mann","original_name":"Gabriel Mann","popularity":0.6654,"profile_path":"/mrqiMfwoQnLBGGP3zvfHrwPKHJW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Seth Carlson","credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a36847f823f461","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Mason","original_name":"Laurence Mason","popularity":0.5963,"profile_path":"/9QCYSKak0Zw6G5yAgGQPOnlOc7I.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Knowledge Johnson","credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a36847f823f465","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":155547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murphy Guyer","original_name":"Murphy Guyer","popularity":0.2032,"profile_path":"/6axiNcYIZmaeRKyfCm3xBHC7KQL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sheriff Mott","credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a36847f823f469","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Alex Johnson","original_name":"Graham Alex Johnson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Peter Carlson","credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a36847f823f46d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":153867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heather Gottlieb","original_name":"Heather Gottlieb","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Kristen Mott","credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a36847f823f471","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Hopkins","original_name":"Josh Hopkins","popularity":0.5139,"profile_path":"/gPcG3xAnuUP9pMxGWkhb5nQqOPQ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marty","credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a36847f823f475","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":197607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maureen Shannon","original_name":"Maureen Shannon","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Francine","credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a36847f823f479","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":121955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Weldon","original_name":"Julia Weldon","popularity":0.1402,"profile_path":"/iOyedb7HyupKxCTfZP4lSA18HDq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sally Carlson","credit_id":"52fe4ccdc3a36847f823f47d","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":227875,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John G.
