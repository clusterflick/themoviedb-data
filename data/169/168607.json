Many of the world's greatest achievements in art, architecture, science, technology and culture are unveiled there. The grounds were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, famous for his design of New York City's Central Park, and constructed under the supervision of Daniel Burnham. The Fair was an engineering marvel. On opening day, President Grover Cleveland depressed a golden telegraph key which sent the first courses of electricity throughout the Fair powering fountains, machines, electric railways and thousands of lights. It was the first use of electricity on such a massive scale. Nearly 28 million visit the \"White City,\" which inspires future innovators like Henry Ford, Walt Disney and Frank Lloyd Wright, and debuts the Ferris Wheel and Cracker Jack.","popularity":0.2335,"poster_path":"/3WcSXq47Vb3D4UgtXkEzGVNaRJM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29524,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inecom Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"EXPO: Magic of the White City","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Wilder","original_name":"Gene Wilder","popularity":1.1259,"profile_path":"/mwwOSWS2m8ArpiUKnoxVVyT8fND.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"52fe4cd1c3a36847f82400f9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1150491,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brian Connelly","original_name":"Brian Connelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cd1c3a36847f8240105","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945154,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Bussler","original_name":"Mark Bussler","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cb8d0e8c22c0001e833de0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0455940","wikidata_id":"Q678139","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hbwIizreWnPx3WeUfEcriftCCc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1742,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3WcSXq47Vb3D4UgtXkEzGVNaRJM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1161}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":520,"name":"chicago, illinois"},{"id":225827,"name":"world's fair"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"EXPO - Magic of the White City (Trailer)","key":"UjVdhhfMwVo","published_at":"2010-03-10T21:00:01.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5936c1bcc3a3685aa900f500"}]}}}
