Along with clips from many of the shorts that made the duo stars, it includes clips from a 1918 comedy starring Laurel on his own as well as scenes from three shorts Hardy made in 1917 and '18 with his original comedy partner, Billy West. To put the duo's work in context, the film briefly features other comedians who worked with producer Hal Roach.","popularity":0.2684,"poster_path":"/mM4htBrc506ZgFIsA7n1v0ZLJWu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17656,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robert Youngson
