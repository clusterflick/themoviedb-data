Georgian ethno-jazz trio The Shin, the Moldavian band Trigon, Owl’s Ethnographic Orchestra and Intars Busulis. Their breath-taking journey into the souls of Georgian, Latvian and Moldavian folk music, their creation of contemporary music akin to cutting shiny new gemstones from rough old folklore treasures, opening hearts and removing borders between nations and languages. In their travels they become brothers and sisters in music. The scenery and melodies, voices and rhythms on the road they take may change. Yet in the end it turns out to be the way home for them all. The Way Home.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/zGK8RXVHxe6dfPVJtmn8mWroI5a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148565,"logo_path":null,"name":"Organizācija „Pasaules mūzika”","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2013-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Way Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1105430,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Uldis Jancis","original_name":"Uldis Jancis","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d71bb02f5e00415298b2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2870002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mārtiņš Grauds","original_name":"Mārtiņš Grauds","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/xSx3TVMimUKwHHVDgKts4jSjuxJ.jpg","credit_id":"6019d6ee8a88b2003fb3ed09","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2350477,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nora Ikstena","original_name":"Nora Ikstena","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d7040f1e58003fe924c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2962787,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ainārs Majors","original_name":"Ainārs Majors","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d768aafebd003de0030b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1777839,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Artis Dukaļskis","original_name":"Artis Dukaļskis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d734aafebd003de00273","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1799243,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andris Grants","original_name":"Andris Grants","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d77c1b70ae003d642e98","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2962788,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ilze Apsiņa","original_name":"Ilze Apsiņa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d794b02f5e003e53b4c3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2870002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mārtiņš Grauds","original_name":"Mārtiņš Grauds","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/xSx3TVMimUKwHHVDgKts4jSjuxJ.jpg","credit_id":"6019d6e1470ead0040722de3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2962786,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juris Strapcāns","original_name":"Juris Strapcāns","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d750d96c3c003f14dd08","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zGK8RXVHxe6dfPVJtmn8mWroI5a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
