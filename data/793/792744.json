This is also the first time he and his fiance and Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black have framed a documentary. The two looked back on the process of meeting and falling in love, the ins and outs of Daly's difficult decision to come out, and how he returned to the platform now is all the credit of Lance. The engagement of the two was blessed by the family and the whole team, and all kinds of loving interactions were sweet and touching. And Daley's latest jumping method \"Fireworks\", which incorporates traditional Russian acrobatics, also appeared in the documentary. Hope to see this different firework at the 2016 Rio Olympics.","popularity":0.3606,"poster_path":"/dCLH5w1HRV87CGQjtRhQJuOp0ph.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3164,"logo_path":"/h06QVxWESaOAfBwkgrWFdbkkccq.png","name":"BBC Worldwide","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tom Daley: Diving for Britain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1532943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Daley","original_name":"Tom Daley","popularity":0.2524,"profile_path":"/aVqRe756kcAF93VtYidNheCevLg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"616ed899a097dc00426536e8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2027836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane Treays","original_name":"Jane Treays","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616ed92353866e0048b89e95","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2263542","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eMs7U5ZEjOVh5wesBdftcFOVLTz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dCLH5w1HRV87CGQjtRhQJuOp0ph.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
