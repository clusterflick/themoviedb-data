The film is an exercise in radical compression, its velocity integral to its comic effects, though all the rapid-fire yakking and spastically edited reverse-shot sequences lead to a wordless denouement in which Mésuline searches her pockets for a cigarette in a shot that’s hardly protracted yet still takes up about one-fifth of this taut little film’s runtime. Her pleasure in finally lighting up is fairly adorable.","popularity":0.212,"poster_path":"/xVXscKc9k7XH2UzGsq27mpXtYWv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dracula Sex Tape","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2755105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Mavangui","original_name":"Leslie Mavangui","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/15mbbVevc2aituUK7humoeIA8aD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6575f1607a3c52014e699fb3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2387381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chloé Germentier","original_name":"Chloé Germentier","popularity":0.0854,"profile_path":"/kjwuP55cpVeCrPvqVDBeHEetgR4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6575f16fec8a43011a397bed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3002913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominick Rustam-Chartrand","original_name":"Dominick Rustam-Chartrand","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/fJ9onYYdz1qSCXezHKxWKYmteAi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6575f17b89d97f01009e1661","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Godin","original_name":"Olivier Godin","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/1m3YfUubEQ1D61aAX9sXieBTmLc.jpg","credit_id":"6575f195ec8a43011a397bfb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Godin","original_name":"Olivier Godin","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/1m3YfUubEQ1D61aAX9sXieBTmLc.jpg","credit_id":"6575f19bec370c013aeda934","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2127942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renaud Després-Larose","original_name":"Renaud Després-Larose","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/iMeMi4lHqO7HKlJ3niWkkEqD29y.jpg","credit_id":"6575f1bce93e95218dcb2af7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2271740,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Johannie Deschambault﻿","original_name":"Johannie Deschambault﻿","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6575f1ccc6006d00e5d3d92e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586378,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Wolkow","original_name":"Matthew Wolkow","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6575f1f4564ec700e10bfa68","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2747591,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Binette","original_name":"Michael Binette","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6575f216ec8a4300aa6bf5e8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2376382,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Sébastien Beaudoin Gagnon","original_name":"Jean-Sébastien Beaudoin Gagnon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6575f1d3a1d33200febcfbe7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2755111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana Tapia Rousiouk","original_name":"Ana Tapia Rousiouk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2MELaDyxN47X7EcOHb8sz1YxHTi.jpg","credit_id":"6575f205e93e95219108a6b4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Godin","original_name":"Olivier Godin","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/1m3YfUubEQ1D61aAX9sXieBTmLc.jpg","credit_id":"6019edb8a76ac5003f5414f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w0fqytqPRWB1y4Dx9CCDONFtCIo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1587,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xVXscKc9k7XH2UzGsq27mpXtYWv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1058}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin Critics’ Week","release_date":"2021-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
