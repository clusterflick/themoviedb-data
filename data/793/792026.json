Protagonist residing on both sides, equipped with a camera as a tool to traverse the wall, can explore and reflect on these seemingly different, yet related environments. A unique trait of the device is established and the video utilizes this ability to construct a fictional narrative. Contemplating resource use by the two sides of the border and putting forward an equation. Equation of pollution, render times, and beautiful simulated nature. The meta-human entities on the digital side are left to dream of a better future, a \"post-representational paradise\". The viewer is invited to observe the border from a comfortable and involving perspective in the physical installation.","popularity":0.2958,"poster_path":"/b4md55zAgAaKzjUDVTA8mvXhZo8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2020-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silicon Sights","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2959252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Centko","original_name":"Adam Centko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6016a5690816c70041896ed5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2959252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Centko","original_name":"Adam Centko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6016a5a61511aa003f53edec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b4md55zAgAaKzjUDVTA8mvXhZo8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":158697,"name":"installation"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"KABK Graduation Festival 2020","release_date":"2020-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SILICON SIGHTS - ADAM CENTKO","key":"29dedCb6iY4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2020-06-24T11:03:12.000Z","id":"6016a49cbb1057003c931fb3"}]}}}
