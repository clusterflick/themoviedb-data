Some of them are confronted with the current political events in Europe, like the Brexit, the Catalan crisis in Spain, yellow vests in France – and in the end the (possible) consequences of Covid 19. At the same time, we see their personal lives: some of them get engaged or get married, but things don’t always go as the protagonists would like – or as the director would like. ‘In Transit’ shows the implications that politics have on the microlevel of people’s lives and gives the recent political events in Europe a human dimension. The film is also a personal journey into a continent that is going through some big changes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7HM6IBve7dO6Lo5iAkoQ1zVveRo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2020-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Transit, Identity and Love in Europe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2961749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martijn Veldhoen","original_name":"Martijn Veldhoen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6018b60ebc2cb300418bdcc4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2961749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martijn Veldhoen","original_name":"Martijn Veldhoen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6018b6150f1e580040e7009b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1131,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7HM6IBve7dO6Lo5iAkoQ1zVveRo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":753}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
