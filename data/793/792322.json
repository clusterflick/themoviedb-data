Inspired by his love for the Suffolk countryside, the ballet is set on a farm and tells a story of love between Lise, the daughter of Widow Simone, and Colas, a young farmer. It contains some of Ashton's most stunning choreography, most strikingly in the series of energetic pas de deux that express the youthful passion of the young lovers, performed here by Natalia Osipova and Steven McRae. The ballet is laced with exuberant good humour, and elements of national folk dance, from dancing chickens and a maypole dance to a Lancashire clog dance for Widow Simone, performed by Philip Mosley.","popularity":0.2784,"poster_path":"/2nd382OvmdNMUI4DbaKvbCoxDpw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Frederick Ashton’s joyful ballet The Wayward Daughter contains some of his most brilliant choreography.","title":"La Fille Mal Gardée (The Royal Ballet)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1560588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalia Osipova","original_name":"Natalia Osipova","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":"/6KfDoNhF5gYAFXcSyhrimjZUFaL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lise","credit_id":"60178bb2e942ee003ff04384","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven McRae","original_name":"Steven McRae","popularity":0.0909,"profile_path":"/nFLOuUrmiyORCotSo07wxlPHQpd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Colas","credit_id":"60178bd79d592c004055d0c2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Kay","original_name":"Paul Kay","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/ekaalr4P8EyjzaAnTjPqeQKKpq6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alain","credit_id":"60178c0c1511aa003f5586c3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1559911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Saunders","original_name":"Christopher Saunders","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/uTS52IlJ3Dvmw7CcQDkx8OG8xv0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Thomas","credit_id":"60178c2d9d592c003f55c918","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1559913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Mosley","original_name":"Philip Mosley","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/u2Nzg9So3DmK0FeGXA2FerEU7Hu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Widow Simone","credit_id":"60178c5687a27a0040e3cbf4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1635430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Stojko","original_name":"Michael Stojko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Cockerel","credit_id":"60178c889d592c004055d1e7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1712866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesca Hayward","original_name":"Francesca Hayward","popularity":0.1744,"profile_path":"/6stZxZAfoIxDzfgCZEAd00e4Bbv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Hen","credit_id":"60178cb1a066450041386f13","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leticia Stock","original_name":"Leticia Stock","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/sWDex4KB3QpF1BRSOb9G3kfb6dh.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Hen","credit_id":"60178cca0816c70042897bd7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1898166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gemma Pitchley-Gale","original_name":"Gemma Pitchley-Gale","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Hen","credit_id":"60178cebbc865700406e15b3","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meaghan Grace Hinkis","original_name":"Meaghan Grace Hinkis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/hQUp2wRxS29BrcvMXjNF2MW7LAe.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Hen","credit_id":"60178d05bb1057003e95d4a0","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139001,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Lanchbery","original_name":"John Lanchbery","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620cb0ee957ce5006de9d9a8","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2833119,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Osbert Lancaster","original_name":"Osbert Lancaster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620cb117aad9c2001b8d2136","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2833119,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Osbert Lancaster","original_name":"Osbert Lancaster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"620cb12daad9c200430a20d7","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1898177,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"John B.
