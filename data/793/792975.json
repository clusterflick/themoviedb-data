On it, like in life, people experience friendship and love, and sometimes feel lonely. On board, the announcement over the PA system outlines the rules, and then a reminder that the train won’t be stopping. Do we hurtle through life without making any stops? What are we thinking? We all know that the moment will come when our train pulls to a stop, but not how and when, and what happens afterwards.","popularity":0.0655,"poster_path":"/dK9jUXrcSoTjtZT0sZzsYIUgQLj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34804,"logo_path":"/sdu4YsenhKo5Jax4XHU0dxNQTXT.png","name":"Locomotive Productions","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2014-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Train Stops at 20:14","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","title":"Vilciens pietur 20:14","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2962790,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daina Zviedre","original_name":"Daina Zviedre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d994e942ee0040f4547c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2962790,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daina Zviedre","original_name":"Daina Zviedre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d99fa5743d003f8a445c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2962790,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daina Zviedre","original_name":"Daina Zviedre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d9abbc8657003eba2e31","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2962791,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jānis Katlaps","original_name":"Jānis Katlaps","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d9c3b97442003c236125","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1700327,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aleksandrs Vaicahovskis","original_name":"Aleksandrs Vaicahovskis","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d9deb97442003e24696e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2962791,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jānis Katlaps","original_name":"Jānis Katlaps","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d9f581a7fc0041fdf157","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1472431,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roberts Vinovskis","original_name":"Roberts Vinovskis","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/in9RlX9vujkIQF2rTw3Q85xqd5F.jpg","credit_id":"6019da0c60620a003f3a3757","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10631554","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":969,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dK9jUXrcSoTjtZT0sZzsYIUgQLj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":646}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13008,"name":"train"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
