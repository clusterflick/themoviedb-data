Opened in 1947 as one of the great luxury hotels in the city, El Virreyes gradually declined in a bohemian atmosphere. Today, it is the home of an international family of artists, students, and political refugees. They are not only passing through, but they live here. Some for years. The documentary \"Hotel Virreyes\" is an intimate portrait of the life and characters within this classic hotel in the Historic Center of Mexico City.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/guevKvvl5QDkFEIq0bXjTGkCuwP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hotel Virreyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2961306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Méndez","original_name":"Manuel Méndez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601850077314a1003df539e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/guevKvvl5QDkFEIq0bXjTGkCuwP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
