With a serene face, relaxed tone and intelligent humor, it is difficult to connect this Pole with that man who was imprisoned for years in concentration camps, including Auschwitz, and who lost his entire family in World War II.  Despite the pain, and after 40 years of silence, Jack offers talks and conferences, receives visitors and cooks for his family and friends.  Using animation and images filmed by Fuchs himself as resources, the new documentary by Tomás Lipgot composes the portrait of a survivor of the Nazi genocide who, at almost ninety years old, surprises with his lucidity and enchantment.","popularity":0.0935,"poster_path":"/1klXTOdIAD1Hd6ROWGHKxCWFLb0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2012-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El árbol de la muralla","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2961269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Fuchs","original_name":"Jack Fuchs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60184a7fb97442003c212bdb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1906676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomás Lipgot","original_name":"Tomás Lipgot","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601849d9b02f5e003e507cb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1906676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomás Lipgot","original_name":"Tomás Lipgot","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601849e3e942ee003ff11338","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1906676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomás Lipgot","original_name":"Tomás Lipgot","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601849edb97442003d2132b9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2223948,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Constanza Sanz Palacios","original_name":"Constanza Sanz Palacios","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601849fcea3949003f286c81","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2226325,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrés Polonsky","original_name":"Andrés Polonsky","popularity":0.0464,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60184a43f9253200402c9133","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1555965,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Leandro Tolchinsky","original_name":"Leandro Tolchinsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60184a50aafebd003ddd23ba","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1klXTOdIAD1Hd6ROWGHKxCWFLb0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
