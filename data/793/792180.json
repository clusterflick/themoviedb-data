She has a daughter named Toni, who mostly grows up with her father. The 9-year-old girl is only with her on weekends. They have planned a mother-daughter weekend, but suddenly Elli is offered an important gig at an electronic music festival. Finally playing in front of a big audience again, feeling the ecstasy and intoxication of the night. Through the music she escapes the stagnation, the desolation, the role model of the conventional mother and the narrowness of the provincial town. Torn between maternal missing her and asserting herself in her life, Elli tries to be there for Toni and at the same time to live her dreams without restrictions.","popularity":0.2271,"poster_path":"/txJyJMAGyg6zSR5OXaGZaiLDw7z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":296,"logo_path":"/oPCnyumoJtIedjQoQin6zSSHkv8.png","name":"Filmakademie
