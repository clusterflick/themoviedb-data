Jan wins a scholarship to an American university eventually becoming a successful engineer. Unbeknownst to him, Katinka, whom he had to leave behind in the village, is sold into slavery by her cruel, dissolute father. Her owner, Victor Dravich, beats her into submission forcing her to become his mistress in his Syrian gambling den. When the house is raided, Dravich takes her on his travels around the world until they finally settle in a small Arizona mining camp. Broken, she sees Jan but is too ashamed to speak to him sending instead for her old tutor Boris. Upon arrival Boris kills Dravich but is shot by the sheriff. Katinka, now free, follows Jan to New York. After further travail the pair are finally reunited.","popularity":0.1521,"poster_path":"/f7VKZAZ7aDPcMkBsamh9oRBSvVl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Her Moment","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1634924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Luther","original_name":"Anna Luther","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/kYVg7Q8pUu7pPftDEXtRNpWneIf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Katinka Veche","credit_id":"6016eaaf713ed4003de4da0a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Garwood","original_name":"William Garwood","popularity":0.1989,"profile_path":"/sFq3FeCnxyEbbNkfnueRbZLDyD8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jan Drakachu","credit_id":"6016eab8bc8657003e6d313a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1173026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Schaefer","original_name":"Anne Schaefer","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":"/9qRdeDOGNal4hgTZhWJ7OhLwMvG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jan's Mother","credit_id":"6016ead5391b9c00408cc936","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Brownlee","original_name":"Frank Brownlee","popularity":0.1183,"profile_path":"/lPmD6rNE4boN95496BaRZcuAv2t.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Victor Dravich","credit_id":"6016eadb0816c70042882812","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1573173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Hadley","original_name":"Bert Hadley","popularity":0.0597,"profile_path":"/v5KR0rddkZDSPi9DwJpZj4o8vOn.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Boris","credit_id":"6654a2d0023cd1567f911dce","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1321148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Lowery","original_name":"William Lowery","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/7bk8W2aVGXSj7WQQSCaVhr20dz2.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Ulaf","credit_id":"6654a2db8d7688c580993134","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murdock MacQuarrie","original_name":"Murdock MacQuarrie","popularity":0.1092,"profile_path":"/xjXY0di1hFXfnErsfAwkOgBSCjd.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Mr. Johnson","credit_id":"6654a3410f9b0999908cd753","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2959497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alida B.
