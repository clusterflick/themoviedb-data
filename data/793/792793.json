A sure-thing comedy closer, the New York City native built hilarious set pieces and character work into Meet the Parents, Zoolander, and Meet the Fockers that not only helped lift them to huge box office but also pushed a few new catchphrases into the American lexicon. A veteran of the uncredited production rewrite, Hamburg also wrote and directed the romantic comedy Along Came Polly in 2004. In this amusing interview, Hamburg discusses how he developed his talent for writing actor-hooking dialogue in the humorous monologues he performed in college, why he'd do a thousand test screenings if he could, and what it's like to hand a new scene to Robert De Niro and stand there waiting to see if he likes it.","popularity":0.2101,"poster_path":"/2NJ6jrXn6GAQhqkko7Cj6154qHo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An interview series that gives unprecedented looks into the lives of working screenwriters.","title":"The Dialogue: An Interview with Screenwriter John Hamburg","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17871,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Hamburg","original_name":"John Hamburg","popularity":0.2906,"profile_path":"/flYIdyuPlLZQ8ur7guVGGvffN0R.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"601944f087a27a0040e6a3d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4767,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael De Luca","original_name":"Michael De Luca","popularity":0.3398,"profile_path":"/i87R2uZafgOmFdbT7PgCBXjsL5s.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"601944fc7314a1003bf7c215","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1174947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Moldavon","original_name":"Dave Moldavon","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019451181a7fc003ffd6393","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1031920","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2490,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2NJ6jrXn6GAQhqkko7Cj6154qHo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1758}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
