After a long year of waiting, the news arrive: an assisted living residence is found for her. Eva takes the first steps towards the \"normal\" life she longs for: to find a job, earn an income of her own, visit her mother... even find love. While she’s taking stock of her past and works on her self-confidence as well as her trust in the outside world, she also fixes firmly on her main goal: to reconnect with the son she lost custody of 20 years ago and ask him to forgive her. The First Woman is a film about second chances, the search for \"normality\" and the borderline between lucidity and darkness.","popularity":0.3863,"poster_path":"/jEO0Gh9ifENBS2OjktbVRfYCgEb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mosaic","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Eva has two dreams: leaving the psychiatric hospital in search of a “normal” life and to reunite with her son after 15 years.","title":"The First Woman","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2371388,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Virginia Galán","original_name":"Virginia Galán","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d04481a7fc0040fd9ac8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1182523,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aina Calleja","original_name":"Aina Calleja","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d01b87a27a0045e61bd2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2962766,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jordi Carrasco","original_name":"Jordi Carrasco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d05ad96c3c003e17cd03","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839262,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Miguel Eek","original_name":"Miguel Eek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5muxXdyggWMUWGTH00hoe09HC0d.jpg","credit_id":"6019d006aafebd003fde5119","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2319775,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rubén Pérez","original_name":"Rubén Pérez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d06c1b70ae003f65fe27","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1182523,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aina Calleja","original_name":"Aina Calleja","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d0250f1e58003fe91664","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839262,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Miguel Eek","original_name":"Miguel Eek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5muxXdyggWMUWGTH00hoe09HC0d.jpg","credit_id":"6019d011b97442003e24516a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839266,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marta Castells","original_name":"Marta Castells","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019d035aafebd003fde5147","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12015542","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"The-First-Woman-113204917274153","instagram_id":"thefirstwomanfilm","twitter_id":"firstwomanfilm"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2835,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jEO0Gh9ifENBS2OjktbVRfYCgEb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1984}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2420,"name":"normality"},{"id":159315,"name":"mental health"},{"id":165601,"name":"self identity"},{"id":166959,"name":"lost mother"},{"id":176227,"name":"motherhood"},{"id":262228,"name":"observational documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Begin Again Films","release_date":"2021-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) - First Appearance Competition","release_date":"2020-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The First Woman - Trailer (English Subtitles)","key":"471733529","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-10-24T16:01:12.000Z","id":"6019cf4a60620a003f3a2626"}]}}}
