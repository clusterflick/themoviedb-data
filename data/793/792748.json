Il genio sensibile.","overview":"A documentary that restores to the world, five hundred years after his death, the universal and sensitive genius of one of the greatest artists of the Italian Renaissance: Raphael Sanzio. Guided by the art historian Luca Tomìo, we decided to start our journey from the Renaissance atmosphere of Raphael’s birthplace, the Duchy of Urbino, to retrace, from the very beginning, Raphael's artistic education. From a young age, he found himself confronted with giants of the Renaissance art such as Piero della Francesca and Antonio del Pollaiolo, in the workshop of his father Giovanni Santi, also an excellent painter of the Urbino court.","popularity":0.1055,"poster_path":"/rSrJN9Qky5fZFyeJJprZbdAGYy2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sydonia Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raphael - A Sensitive Genius","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Рафаель: Чутливий геній","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4807771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enrico Verdicchio","original_name":"Enrico Verdicchio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Raffaello","credit_id":"6684d779cbbe2375babafb3a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2961900,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alessandro Tarabelli","original_name":"Alessandro Tarabelli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6019124fbc86570045b94f69","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2557707,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claudio Centioni","original_name":"Claudio Centioni","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60191207aafebd003ddead26","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977058,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Trovellesi Cesana","original_name":"Luca Trovellesi Cesana","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601911f3bc86570045b94e12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12072080","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rSrJN9Qky5fZFyeJJprZbdAGYy2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/n3K4Dl1rnRTlCNs6DzHw0M9RaWl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/ohGqPHP4F76JbAqYqy3Jd10TMeo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/xWqltHoUYRFOk8hPDlcLwEwYlpN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
