However, can anyone imagine that circus artists reside right there in the circus building - above the arena in the second floor hotel rooms - where they also prepare meals, do their laundry and try out their magic tricks? For over 125 years, despite the discomfort of non-renovated premises and ubiquitous animal odor, local and foreign circus artists follow their routine to create the circus miracle. Sugarcane, Coati and Monowheel is a film about those who dwell in Riga Circus and about what happens outside the arena before and after meeting audience under the circus dome.","popularity":0.1179,"poster_path":"/e8TtL8YSttK6wPgafnpC14UAEFP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Air Productions","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2014-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sugarcane, Coati and Monowheel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235492,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Līga Gaisa","original_name":"Līga Gaisa","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601f06dd681888003db5c434","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1884330,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lote Eglīte","original_name":"Lote Eglīte","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6017041b1511aa0041561f59","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973137,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gatis Grīnbergs","original_name":"Gatis Grīnbergs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6017042e1511aa0040554f49","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235492,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Līga Gaisa","original_name":"Līga Gaisa","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601703f7001bbd003f6a25a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297711,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anrijs Krenbergs","original_name":"Anrijs Krenbergs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60170443bb1057003e94aa9c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235492,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Līga Gaisa","original_name":"Līga Gaisa","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60170406001bbd00416a22ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":849,"iso_639_1":"lv","file_path":"/e8TtL8YSttK6wPgafnpC14UAEFP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"lv","file_path":"/3feJME4TV77z2pDz9VyLsC4WWg7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":291,"name":"circus"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Cukurvate, degunlāči un monocikls.
