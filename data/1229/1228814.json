Louis Llech, a Perpignan based shopkeeper and enlightened amateur cineaste, owned a 16mm camera. Together with his friend Isambert, he filmed this extraordinary migration. Fascinated by the military aspect of this Retirada, he favoured shots of parades, of crowds, like those showing military equipment. He nonetheless also showed civilian distress, without insisting on its picturesque aspects, focussing more on images of the uninterrupted flow of refugees.","popularity":0.0787,"poster_path":"/4shxtkQ0zzuftCZVDMZP12c0PAA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1939-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Exode d'un peuple","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4472865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Llech","original_name":"Louis Llech","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659db3638e8d30014c1ff70b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4472866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Isambert","original_name":"Louis Isambert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659db3731d78f201a5b99137","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1173,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dmMGsCEOKVJ5sZ6BCLRJjzTeP7U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":782},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1173,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/4shxtkQ0zzuftCZVDMZP12c0PAA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":782}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5509,"name":"spanish civil war (1936-39)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1939-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
