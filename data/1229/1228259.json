This two-block-long business strip is home to a cast of restaurateurs, store owners, environmentalists, hometown locals and Manhattan transplants. Their stories highlight not only the beauty of the beaches and bay, but also the challenges of economic, environmental, and health precarity to the street itself and those who count on it. By presenting a range in points of view, the film seeks to further conversation about these common issues widely at stake today.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/sgeAkGyJrtPEea9Hz3949syw5GK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":217871,"logo_path":null,"name":"Passing Planes Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":217872,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lucky Find Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beach 116: Stories From a Rockaway Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4470710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Quinby","original_name":"Lee Quinby","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659c1cdca1074b0148b116cd","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4185291,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Scarpati","original_name":"Daniel Scarpati","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659c1ced8741c418a0a23961","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4470710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Quinby","original_name":"Lee Quinby","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659c1cd321621d216ccece80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4185291,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Scarpati","original_name":"Daniel Scarpati","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659c1d1c1d1bf44e9bc7fdb1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1312,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sgeAkGyJrtPEea9Hz3949syw5GK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":875}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Beach 116: Stories From a Rockaway Street - 4K Trailer 2023","key":"890690441","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-12-03T00:25:25.000Z","id":"659c1d5c8741c4025894ef7e"}]}}}
