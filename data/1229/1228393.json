In 1957, talk arose that Japan's largest dam would be built in Tokuyama Village, Gifu Prefecture. While the residents moved to new locations, some elderly families returned to Tokuyama Village, wanting to continue living there for as long as possible. Ōnishi, who grew up in the Ibi District, was fascinated by the lives of those elderly people and continued to photograph them for 15 years until the village sank to the bottom of the dam.","popularity":0.1272,"poster_path":"/qpu3lxE8Er8I1Tnw7aqsmpvS03n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151650,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pole Pole Times","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2007-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Village Submerged","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Mizu ni natta mura","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4471159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuo Onishi","original_name":"Nobuo Onishi","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659c5fc02dc44e2d1e7e756b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seiichi Motohashi","original_name":"Seiichi Motohashi","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c2ab27e7c097017dcf17a4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2395752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Koichi Doi","original_name":"Koichi Doi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c2ab322fe2fa01842953e7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4471159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuo Onishi","original_name":"Nobuo Onishi","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c2ab39cb75d1017c6bccfb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2395752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Koichi Doi","original_name":"Koichi Doi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c2ab3f15794a0183546d71","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1335270,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yusuke Hayashi","original_name":"林祐介","popularity":0.1552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c2af2795acf001621b7a6d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1700,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/qpu3lxE8Er8I1Tnw7aqsmpvS03n.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":975,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/5AfRihm1U4jCewBuKDEFuQlmkYA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":650}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2007-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
