The original texts were retranslated by Rob Klinkenberg and then thoroughly adapted: the Hundred Years' War between England and France, and the Rose Wars between the houses of Lancaster and York for the English throne, which are emphatically present as a historical context in the original pieces, were referred to the background in the adaptation in order to accommodate a varied portrait of successive kings. As leaders in times of political instability and war, they show remarkable affinities with world leaders today.","popularity":0.4019,"poster_path":"/awqbe0S5Nevcb4tzQMooMYXkINR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-22","revenue":100000,"runtime":270,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ivo
