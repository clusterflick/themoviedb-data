No other film to date fills the gaps or tells the story chronologically the way this film does. The film is also different from anything produced to date because a small group of protestors, some who are J6 defendants, have been the ones to collect hours of footage to help contextualize the events of the day. The film was funded and produced entirely through small donations and tens of thousands of volunteer man hours. The hope is that the film will provoke all Americans to be more curious about the true timeline of January 6.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/dBb2QzQyzYj2c46FoCvcLE47yO1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Uncensored: The J6 Timeline","title":"J6: A True Timeline","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4960733,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"AJ Fischer","original_name":"AJ Fischer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f2f8dd2d98d59ce13b7240","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4906373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Escandon","original_name":"Paul Escandon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f2fbf06c3b7a8d648e4815","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4906373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Escandon","original_name":"Paul Escandon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f2fc126c3b7a8d648e484e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4906374,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Rink","original_name":"Jason Rink","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f2fc37583c56cdb1267c58","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4960768,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Daniel Goodwyn","original_name":"Daniel Goodwyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f2fc886c3b7a8d648e48ae","department":"Editing","job":"Archival Footage Research"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4960769,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dave Sumrall","original_name":"Dave Sumrall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f2fca0a82b0057032703ba","department":"Editing","job":"Archival Footage Research"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4960769,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dave Sumrall","original_name":"Dave Sumrall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f2fcdba82b0057032703df","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4960733,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"AJ Fischer","original_name":"AJ Fischer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f2fd1ade2d52dfbd8d9dff","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1001,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dBb2QzQyzYj2c46FoCvcLE47yO1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":709},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gwjtAiN3mg3OwJCZpa97q3nWS9u.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
