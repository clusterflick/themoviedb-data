Catalonia was occupied by fascist troops, 465,0000 refugees flee across the border. The French authorities order the construction of a camp on the beach... The film evokes the existence of the Argeles sur Mer concentration camp (Pyrénées-Orientales), from its creation in January 1939 to its closure in September 1941. In 1939 , filmmakers and activists, shocked by this camp, managed to smuggle a camera behind the wire fence. The few images taken directly from the Argeles camp were filmed with a hidden camera and many were seized and destroyed. “El Campo de Argeles” proposes to recreate these lost images and intersect camp life with archival images and testimonies collected throughout Europe: former internees in the camp (Spanish Republicans, Jews...) and also guards and witnesses.","popularity":0.0545,"poster_path":"/lAJfxq3it4gvEuQtgqunNFtRgcn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Camp d'Argelers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4472755,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jordi Sanromà","original_name":"Jordi Sanromà","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659da6321d78f201493fe38a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felip Solé","original_name":"Felip Solé","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659da621eb64f101a909ec28","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1954316","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lAJfxq3it4gvEuQtgqunNFtRgcn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
