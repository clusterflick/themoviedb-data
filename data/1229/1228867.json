We become entirely fixated on how late a bus line might be one day, whether that pothole we saw last month has been fixed, or angry that our expectations at a large event weren’t met. In the end, the city we want to live in is the one we construct. It’s one molded by hope, love, and, sometimes, the smell of lilac trees in early spring. This is our love letter to Sofia – a city that neither of us grew up in, but one that, like a letter from a forgotten love, we’ve read over and over again and reminded ourselves of how, for that one moment in time, we saw everything brighter, happier, and, in a way, endless.  This is the start of a conversation.  We hope you’ll fall in love as well, whether that be for 12 minutes or a lifetime.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sofia","title":"To Sofia, with love / За София, с любов","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
