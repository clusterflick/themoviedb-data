La insolencia del condenado","overview":"The name of the documentary is taken from the \"Causa 661/52\" against Ricardo Beneyto Sapena \"Ramiro\" and Rafael Armada Ruz, both political leaders of the Málaga-Granada Guerrilla Group. As well as against Sebastián Ramos Díaz, Manuel Jiménez Espadafor, José Guirado Parra and Enrique Arroyo Lozano. In the author's own words, this documentary can be summarized as follows: \"Historical memory has usurped the place of political memory. The normalizing machine stifles the power of the story, confines revolutionary ruptures in the straitjacket of melodrama. Why \"Is there so much emphasis on exclusively sentimental recoveries of the past?\" The documentary \"Causa 661/52\" investigates, based on the history of the Guerrilla Group of Granada and Málaga, the keys to this displacement.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zbKZNnGFpjS2XLCO8swKMJpJ53R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Causa 661/52.
