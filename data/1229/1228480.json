The tragic love story of Mu Hyeok (So Ji Sub of What Happened in Bali) and Eun Chae (Yim Soo Jung of Lump Sugar and I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK) made stars out of its leads and attracted an enormous fanbase throughout Asia. Two years later, G&G Entertainment released a 35-minute animated version of the drama, Between of One Year, consisting of highlights from the drama and new scenes dealing with the final moments of Eun Chae and Mu Hyeok's relationship. The script was supervised by the writer of the original live-action drama, Lee Kyung Hee.","popularity":0.0613,"poster_path":"/rQT9t12cYWZnYsvTzvG4wnoEa13.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134119,"logo_path":"/lGONwb3McHeropXAo8tDCp00pyI.png","name":"Meditation With a Pencil","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sorry I Love You: Between of One Year","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"미안하다 사랑한다","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Mianhada Saranghanda","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1084152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahn Jae-huun","original_name":"안재훈","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/dIA2wThm57G7D7x4tHnFWVgAara.jpg","credit_id":"659cb082f8595800ef3e8b03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11807984","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rQT9t12cYWZnYsvTzvG4wnoEa13.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9840,"name":"romance"},{"id":315152,"name":"k-culture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
