It took 9 years, thousands of people and millions of man-hours to construct. It has delivered over 109km of new high-speed railway, the world's longest span concrete high-speed rail bridge, 47km of cutting edge tunnels, and in St Pancras International, has created a truly world class station. On the 6th November 2007, High Speed 1 (HS1) was delivered to the nation. Britain had finally got its first new railway for over a century, and was fully connected to the rapidly expanding European high-speed rail network.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/sX3D7TpsOjjptKvPBR6qhFVH3fh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Geographic: Britain's New Railway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j8uY9Pr4i1eEFjAH7dAJOiBvJga.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9aHuQSS9bRwUJGsGWttMsOiY2U7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sX3D7TpsOjjptKvPBR6qhFVH3fh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Britain's New High Speed One Rail - Megastructures: UK Super Train - UK Engineering Documentary","key":"I--5H-02JCU","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-05T20:43:09.000Z","id":"659cc37823168c01a54a5ea9"}]}}}
