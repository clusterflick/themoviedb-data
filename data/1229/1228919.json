The boundaries between everyday life and art are blurry. While increasing political and institutional violence, artists try to transform their ideas into realities. The dictatorship plans to stay in power for a century with the self-assigned mission of “morally healing” Argentina’s spirit. Among broken artists, emerging pop stars, poets with metallic voices, and collectors running shady deals, Prat, a young and morally ambiguous upstart, is a new face in the art scene. Is he a service provider, an artist, or just another outcast? He meets Omar, an artist he admires, and Maria, a mystical anarchist hiding her oligarch lineage. The trio wanders through nightclubs, spontaneous fashion shows, psycho-magical group therapy sessions, and dinners in the rooms of bitter political figures. The backdrop is a collapse that seems imminent.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":92205,"logo_path":"/hF6IPspVk9h6pdzerRHsVE4unJ2.png","name":"MaravillaCine","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":71214,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmy Wiktora","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Class Camouflage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2873037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Martín Segal","original_name":"Alan Martín Segal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659e17298e8d30025e1251f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leandro Listorti","original_name":"Leandro Listorti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/nleOXNPJfJ2Z1AvCJ6yTztgtnF5.jpg","credit_id":"659e174c6728a8025b1f0ad0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2873037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Martín Segal","original_name":"Alan Martín Segal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659e17319590e301a43fcfbd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145476,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gastón Solnicki","original_name":"Gastón Solnicki","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659e171991b53001a326a59e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1735314,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paula Zyngierman","original_name":"Paula Zyngierman","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zfZtllbfimOihSrSpW5MOp1Ldc1.jpg","credit_id":"659e17406728a80149c62cc8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
