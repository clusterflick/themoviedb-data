Hasbannium is a series of impressionist evocations drawing elliptic sequences in a metaphorical desert, an experimental fiction which has it’s root in Hesbaye, an agricultural region in Belgium with open horizons, devoid of forests or rivers.  Through these landscapes, a choral film comes into being, with figures seeking out a humanity that reinvents itself in a universe of signs and meanings that are increasingly confused.\r The result is an impressive evocation of the temptation to disappear in which absence to self and world sketches out granular motifs.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hasbannium","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2142025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Depas","original_name":"Thomas Depas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1SUN92wrRDEl5C1g13hgJNXwGNV.jpg","credit_id":"659d45c7c8a5ac01490da9a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10998514","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
