The ANC is rife with corruption. White people still hold the wealth, leaving the black majority with little hope for social advancement. But whilst economic power is largely still in the hands of the white elites, black middle and upper classes have emerged. The effect on the poorly educated white working class has been disastrous. Around 80 slums have appeared which look just like the black townships but consist solely of white communities. We meet the racist political parties who fuel the hatred. The EFF advocate forcefully taking land back from white people and their leader, Julius Malema, is now the country’s most popular politician.","popularity":0.3979,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":91933,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tony Comiti Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Zulu","iso_639_1":"zu","name":"isiZulu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"South Africa: The End of a Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4251250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wendy Zbinden","original_name":"Wendy Zbinden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659c399489b5612294980312","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4470934,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cédric Fouré","original_name":"Cédric Fouré","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659c399cb4a5435786890e05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
