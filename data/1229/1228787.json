He took a doctorate from the University of Freiburg. When he was only 26 he began analysis with Jung. Later, with Jung’s approval, he decided to become an analyst himself. Shortly after Hitler came to power, he moved to London where he became a leading Jungian analyst and a co-founder of the original Jungian training society. He was chosen by Jung, along with Dr. Michael Fordham, to edit the Collected Works of Jung in English and was co-editor with Aniela Jaffe of Jung’s Letters, Vol I & II.","popularity":0.1034,"poster_path":"/kNgV6PvHgBlaTaNVcrB9WFBWaK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remembering Jung","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Remembering Jung #01: A Conversation about C.G.
