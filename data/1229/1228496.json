Given its location and characteristics, the Red Sea should be one of the least concerning seas in the world, but it is fragile and needs protecting. The film recognises and follows the inspiring journey of the diverse group of people dedicating their lives to protecting it, sharing their frustrations and sacrifices as well as their achievements and hope. Inspired by the alarming facts of the IUCN red list, the film highlights some of the most extraordinary but sadly endangered species that are key to the Red Sea's survival.","popularity":0.1011,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RED: A Sea Worth Protecting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4471653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Hilton-Taylor","original_name":"Craig Hilton-Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"659cc597f859580093b69747","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4471654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Ziltener","original_name":"Angela Ziltener","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"659cc5b0b6cff10094e45ab5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4471655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micol Montagna","original_name":"Micol Montagna","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"659cc5bc55c1f401487528e6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3350435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Hamilton","original_name":"Philip Hamilton","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/zTKZ64VKkB9E6uBh3V00db9BWKG.jpg","credit_id":"659cc560f29d66025bd96126","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
