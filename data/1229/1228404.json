It details the process from planning to completion, emphasizing the efficient use of limited urban space by building upward. Key phases include laying deep foundations, constructing a massive steel frame, and installing interior and exterior elements. The building, featuring high-speed elevators, escalators, stores, and restaurants, functions as a self-contained urban hub. The project, culminating in a \"topping out\" ceremony, symbolizes the collaborative effort of hundreds over two years, resulting in an 82-story building that significantly contributes to city life.","popularity":0.4268,"poster_path":"/8UG249nA18owIL1OTf64qugzdj9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20948,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coronet Instructional Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A City Grows: The Skyscraper","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4471214,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mark Carlson","original_name":"Mark Carlson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659c69bda1074b0093d62163","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4471215,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rick Simon","original_name":"Rick Simon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659c69cabd588b3f61123850","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3622196,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wayne A.
