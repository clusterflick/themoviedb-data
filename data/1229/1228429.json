We started this film before we were even pregnant, it was our way of bringing you here. This film portrays a nonlinear narrative of the alienating process of becoming pregnant as a trans and non-binary couple. The images move between claymation, animation, paper dolls receiving medical care, puppets and live footage and archival footage from our previous collaborations as well as found audio from a 1950â€™s informational pregnancy video. The rabbit is the third character in the film, representing a multitude of histories in regards to pregnancy and eventually becomes our baby.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"you are here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
