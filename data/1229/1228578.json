When trying to get a check-up she miserably fails to do the self-testing kit and ends up in the Sexual Health clinic, where the only person still there to see her is middle-aged grumpy Dr Mark Mackenzie. While her friends wind her up more and more via text about what she might have picked up, Mark is trying to get her out of the door as quickly as possible. Their consultation is interrupted by NHS messaging apps pestering Mark to get to the ward round and a test ordering system that doesn't let Tiger be checked for \"everything\". Anxiously awaiting the bedside test result for HIV, Tiger connects with Mark over the difficulties the digital world poses for both of them in different ways.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sMdj44vaedqFpmHZViTvTcu6DCl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Text Kit","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4471970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chanice Hird","original_name":"Chanice Hird","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tiger","credit_id":"659d2d855437f501ffada129","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4624768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Duff","original_name":"David Duff","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Dr. Mark MacKenzie","credit_id":"66086b60e62719017c0dd489","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4624769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denys Gaskill","original_name":"Denys Gaskill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Marilyn","credit_id":"66086b82590086017cb9a583","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4471964,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Barbara Vonau","original_name":"Barbara Vonau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659d2c7c23168c00ef280967","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2034705,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vaiginta Perkauskaitė","original_name":"Vaiginta Perkauskaitė","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66086aff590086017cb9a53e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4624766,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dagmara Kodlubanski","original_name":"Dagmara Kodlubanski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66086b3aa894d6017c65b859","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3173687,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Jerzy Gudjonsson","original_name":"Jerzy Gudjonsson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66086b1ae1faed017dfc26d3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12372594","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sMdj44vaedqFpmHZViTvTcu6DCl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Raindance Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
