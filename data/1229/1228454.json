Performing material from three Number 1 albums (Replica's, The Pleasure Principle and Telekon) against the spectacular backdrop of one of the largest sets ever built on a stage in the UK, this is Numan delivering on every level - songs that are still hugely influencial 30 years later, pure pop star theatre and a light show as big as a city.
