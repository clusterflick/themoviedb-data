He was a human being in animal guise. The story begins in Ré Valley, which lies like a yawning gap between mountains, long and flat with borders of forests so dark that they look as though part of the blackness of night lingered in them. A river moves sluggishly along the bottom of the valley, making its way slowly and carefully between stretches of light-red sand. It runs northwards, a rare thing in Norway.","popularity":0.1272,"poster_path":"/jiIB3in5FAtN4XukXHHIk2jt0ha.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1927-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Troll-Elgen","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":227269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tryggve Larssen","original_name":"Tryggve Larssen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sjur Renna 'Gaupa'","credit_id":"52fe4d1dc3a368484e1d7e9f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bengt Djurberg","original_name":"Bengt Djurberg","popularity":0.0488,"profile_path":"/dNglpZDGLCOK6d0fJ9YMcdhBzcM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hans Trefothaugen","credit_id":"52fe4d1dc3a368484e1d7ea3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1188965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Lampe","original_name":"Julie Lampe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Turi Trefothaugen, mor til Hans","credit_id":"52fe4d1dc3a368484e1d7ea7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tove Tellback","original_name":"Tove Tellback","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ingrid Rustebakke","credit_id":"52fe4d1dc3a368484e1d7eab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harald Stormoen","original_name":"Harald Stormoen","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Hallstein Rustebakke, storbonde","credit_id":"52fe4d1dc3a368484e1d7eaf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":225827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Einar Tveito","original_name":"Einar Tveito","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Gunnar Sløvika, hestehandler","credit_id":"52fe4d1dc3a368484e1d7eb3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Egil Hjorth-Jenssen","original_name":"Egil Hjorth-Jenssen","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/yojwi8mn5pcyKkhLFLjCXCZ25uB.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Tølleiv, tjenestegutt på Rustbakke","credit_id":"52fe4d1dc3a368484e1d7eb7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1188968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mimi Kihle","original_name":"Mimi Kihle","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Bellina, danser","credit_id":"52fe4d1dc3a368484e1d7ebb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hauk Aabel","original_name":"Hauk Aabel","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Piper, direktør","credit_id":"52fe4d1dc3a368484e1d7ebf","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nils Aréhn","original_name":"Nils Aréhn","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/8iKENizuIar1yrLuVm2hyuIivrx.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"P.
