Ryan Jerabek wanted to get out of Green Bay, Wisconsin, see the world and do something different. Moved by what happened on September 11th, the honor student and varsity athlete joined the Marines and left for boot camp weeks after his high school graduation. Nine months later, he was killed in Iraq. The film chronicles, over two years, the changes in the lives of his family. Beyond politics, headlines and statistics, JERABEK offers a candid, personal look at the toll one death takes.","popularity":0.2895,"poster_path":"/AbxPd2RTeJa0Ib5fZIANYCeQaGe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79309,"logo_path":null,"name":"True Story Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One family.
