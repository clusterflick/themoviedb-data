But before he can learn anything about Barbara, her social climbing Aunt Bedelia (Ethel Wales), whisks her away. On a mission to \"find the girl,\" Tommy looks for her everywhere. He unknowingly befriends her brother Charlie, who invites him to spend the evening in Smith's palatial home. The next morn Aunt Bedelia finds Tommy with his head wrapped in a towel and assumes him to be the Hindu prince that Charlie promised to bring to her society party. Introduced to all as a Prince from Calcutta, Tommy is forced to see the charade through. But the local con-man Charlie had previously arranged to appear at the party as the Prince shows up as well. At least Tommy is able to reconnect with Barbara, that is until the police show up with orders to arrest all fake fakirs.","popularity":0.2092,"poster_path":"/yCBQnQIqX7L2RBB9QQ8lGcQc5ds.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28230,"logo_path":null,"name":"DeMille Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Friend from India","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franklin Pangborn","original_name":"Franklin Pangborn","popularity":0.2768,"profile_path":"/dwVc1uGVVIhg7aplx7HLBmyObky.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"William / Tommy Valentine","credit_id":"52fe4d15c3a368484e1d62ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elinor Fair","original_name":"Elinor Fair","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":"/obwXPqtyOjRsQjE16nKl3aNUd2c.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bernice / Barbara","credit_id":"52fe4d15c3a368484e1d62f1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Hendricks Jr.","original_name":"Ben Hendricks Jr.","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/gpNJtZQ78NvXRmYoErCPuotQJ7y.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Charles / Charlie","credit_id":"52fe4d15c3a368484e1d62f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1016037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Wales","original_name":"Ethel Wales","popularity":0.1689,"profile_path":"/8TspAWWfu1IvRbQ46FrD9hJrtoO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Arabella Mott / Bedelia Smith","credit_id":"52fe4d15c3a368484e1d62f9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1188450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanette Loff","original_name":"Jeanette Loff","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":"/6kfkmWKRnKtvsCjLynb6nHpnB1k.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marion / Ruth Brooks","credit_id":"52fe4d15c3a368484e1d62fd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Ricketts","original_name":"Tom Ricketts","popularity":0.1217,"profile_path":"/66ezBnrNzoiL82VNBjo6NTAYHns.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Judge Elmer Elderberry Egbert Belmore","credit_id":"52fe4d15c3a368484e1d6301","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Natheaux","original_name":"Louis Natheaux","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":"/h5TozPP8nx5hGdIfNr4vhaHZzMj.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"T.
