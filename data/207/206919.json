He would like to take this opportunity to apologise for the silly-looking Ferret graphics - the palette simply ran out of colours.  The Kickstart is sent to take part in a competition organised by a powerful alien race, the Zarquons. Further complicating Pirk's already impossible mission, Mr Spook, unable to bear Pirk's incompetence, resigns and returns to his home planet of Vulgarus. His replacement is Mr Info. Being a robot, Info is immune to Pirk's insults, but is at least as irritating as good old Spook.","popularity":0.2847,"poster_path":"/7CEU9mHG3BItuWISwAhTOWnG6J3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Energia Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1996-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Star Wreck IV: The Kilpailu","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Star Wreck 4","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Star Wreck -
