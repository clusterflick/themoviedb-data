One night, the boys succeed in a mass escape and split up. Kyu and Ryoji hear the sirens shrieking behind them and panic. Kyu pretends he has been hit by a small truck and Ryoji demands that they be taken to a hospital, little dreaming that Nagai, the driver, is the official guardian of juveniles. The next morning the two boys hear a light knock, and Nagai's daughter, Noriko enters, but surprise is changed to fear as they see her father approaching with Kume, the Juvenile Officer. Their one thought is escape but Kyu discovers his leg is stiff and it pains him to move. In the excitement, he had not realized he had really been hit by the truck. He sends Ryoji away while he waits alone for Officer Kume. Nagai takes Kyu under his wing, while Ryoji finds himself again in the hard-boiled world.","popularity":0.5234,"poster_path":"/v9Ff1CdckqovdL2dwpKKUKC15eB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":955,"logo_path":"/5xnXD3PJI1HqOJceSAKZ3fDqO1V.png","name":"Nikkatsu Corporation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1962-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keep Your Chin Up","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","title":"飛男玉女","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","title":"Going Forward","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1200139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyū Sakamoto","original_name":"坂本九","popularity":0.1627,"profile_path":"/4R28CgojDtCrKCV6qSQ20LsEbUv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kyô Kawanishi","credit_id":"586ab3df92514121340021b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitsuo Hamada","original_name":"浜田光夫","popularity":0.35,"profile_path":"/quRzg54y96vxHzZJSwgj70B1vM0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ryôji Tomoda","credit_id":"586ab3e5c3a3686e2a0024b4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1006012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sayuri Yoshinaga","original_name":"吉永小百合","popularity":1.0232,"profile_path":"/1VYlrsgty9qSj1a9VeJTsWLPaPn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Noriko Nagai","credit_id":"586ab3fac3a3686e0600250d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1731566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomoko Watanabe","original_name":"Tomoko Watanabe","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mitsuko Nagai","credit_id":"586ab41c925141212f0023e5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daizaburo Hirata","original_name":"平田大三郎","popularity":0.3352,"profile_path":"/s26g5Kjuu37NzyfAVgrS85zjJp4.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Wakabayashi","credit_id":"586ab44e92514121380022ba","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masao Shimizu","original_name":"清水将夫","popularity":0.3199,"profile_path":"/77QHN0Ac5Oq31R1PKQSIVX3nFzX.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Shôichirô","credit_id":"586ab474925141213e0020f9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasukiyo Umeno","original_name":"梅野泰靖","popularity":0.1862,"profile_path":"/ihTde4XOjVuWwLgzdHDKIcQHemE.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Jessie Maki","credit_id":"586ab48d925141213b00220e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shinsuke Ashida","original_name":"芦田伸介","popularity":0.5634,"profile_path":"/a0EZmpmWcPzpLuLnrhtG2YvZMSW.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Tokuzô Nagai","credit_id":"586ab495925141212f002435","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":390407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideki Takahashi","original_name":"高橋英樹","popularity":0.4097,"profile_path":"/uu4nvWWl7e8pEaNOhjDHTAqNtVN.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Takeshi Matsumoto","credit_id":"593474c39251417e1d0252ad","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68412,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toshio Masuda","original_name":"舛田利雄","popularity":0.3581,"profile_path":"/pUEXPvKBl6BFIKAcDpknXlJn2Xn.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d23c3a368484e1d8fef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563704,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nobuo Yamada","original_name":"山田信夫","popularity":0.3601,"profile_path":"/zuzf7Hm9p5kUyQjktlurCxeQHtR.jpg","credit_id":"586ab4c8c3a3686e10002414","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0208529","wikidata_id":"Q89589360","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zqfGwnjyLRqCYov2bZ20ZnJ82RN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v1DEckanJkvfqWrOJS99YTz5YaR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":526},{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/v9Ff1CdckqovdL2dwpKKUKC15eB.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1962-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
