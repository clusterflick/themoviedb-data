She warms to her teacher for the way that he defends her against the taunts of some of the students, but when she's made to wear a dunce cap, she flees the schoolhouse in shame. Unsupervised by her alcoholic father, Nora becomes a determined truant, wandering the town during school hours. There she catches the attention of a huckster, who convinces her that they will run away and be married. The schoolmaster, meanwhile, preoccupied by Nora's absence, leaves his other students to go find her. He encounters her at a crossroads, being spirited away by the huckster, and calls the man's bluff by saying that he'll find them a minister.","popularity":2.097,"poster_path":"/lDFGyx8En1bZawyHgE0ojV0wtxM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The School Teacher and the Waif","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin August","original_name":"Edwin August","popularity":0.1212,"profile_path":"/cpnHZ8of3zIXpsGG6jsLl7dCZ8s.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The School Teacher","credit_id":"52fe4d21c3a368484e1d89fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Pickford","original_name":"Mary Pickford","popularity":0.6455,"profile_path":"/y0FHoj9AjmVveKkdeFuqhuVYaTf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nora, the Waif","credit_id":"52fe4d21c3a368484e1d8a01","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Hill Mailes","original_name":"Charles Hill Mailes","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/At3GtUXi9WLKero09JGxxVCY6Ph.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nora's Father","credit_id":"52fe4d21c3a368484e1d8a05","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Hendler","original_name":"Bert Hendler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"A Street Fakir","credit_id":"52fe4d21c3a368484e1d8a09","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire McDowell","original_name":"Claire McDowell","popularity":0.4763,"profile_path":"/lITEhC4pY2UiqmItzQMBnexxcMU.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Street Fakir's Sweetheart","credit_id":"52fe4d21c3a368484e1d8a0d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William A.
