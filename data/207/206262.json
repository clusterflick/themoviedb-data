Assumed to be a man because of the name, Freddy creates a sensation appearing at a dance in the newest creation from Paris, and later incurs the ire of all when she accidentally causes a stampede. Ranch foreman Bruce Elwood (Arnold Gray) eventually wins the heart of the leading lady when he rescues Freddy from a villainous cattle rustler. A year after this light comedy, Dean began to wind down her career, and played a foil to Laurel and Hardy in Slipping Wives.","popularity":0.1992,"poster_path":"/smGSOMCnXRmP9YCp7mHzkJLiU16.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"West of Broadway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Priscilla Dean","original_name":"Priscilla Dean","popularity":0.1165,"profile_path":"/twj8OOwEL8vlkD7h5sF7pFL8gk2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"'Freddie' Hayden","credit_id":"52fe4d19c3a368484e1d6fe3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":145705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnold Gray","original_name":"Arnold Gray","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/nQradnBbwwqU27uDqOqrpxPU5TM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bruce Elwood","credit_id":"52fe4d19c3a368484e1d6fe7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1188677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Majel Coleman","original_name":"Majel Coleman","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":"/h9q2teGqfBYOlhCfNGITI10oQMP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Muriel Styles","credit_id":"52fe4d19c3a368484e1d6feb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Long","original_name":"Walter Long","popularity":0.122,"profile_path":"/oS2Ip4I7H5MQhKQcTNXVqMK62Im.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bad Willie","credit_id":"52fe4d19c3a368484e1d6fef","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Thornby","original_name":"Robert Thornby","popularity":0.1941,"profile_path":"/dNxou1Tn7Yhm1Rk1oxx8JGC5iBi.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d19c3a368484e1d6fdf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0177372","wikidata_id":"Q17104443","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1317,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/smGSOMCnXRmP9YCp7mHzkJLiU16.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":878}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2702,"name":"golf"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1926-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
