Narrated by Anthony LaPaglia.  After the disaster of World War II, a wave of Italian immigrants found their way to Melbourne - a strange place, suspicious of outsiders and completely devoid of a good cup of espresso. Congregating in a then run-down stretch of Carlton known as Lygon Street, these irrepressible restaurateurs, entrepreneurs and sometime mafiosi would come to define not only a street, but an entire country.  'Lygon Street - Si parla Italiano' brings to life the people, places and, of course, pastas that have made up one of Australia's most remarkable communities.","popularity":0.1909,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2013-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Food, wine, coffee...and a little bit of gambling","title":"Lygon Street - Si parla Italiano","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony LaPaglia","original_name":"Anthony LaPaglia","popularity":0.9589,"profile_path":"/31fRY01Dq2ebkx09FjuG5g3QW9G.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5e4af2e91e92250015c4f0ef","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1962374,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shannon Swan","original_name":"Shannon Swan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4af1f09a3c490016318c33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1877911,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Asher Pope","original_name":"Asher Pope","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4af2159b8616001164c427","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2542016,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jason McFadyen","original_name":"Jason McFadyen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea20762c6006d001dfc7b70","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1962374,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shannon Swan","original_name":"Shannon Swan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea2079d8e87020024104317","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1490248,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Katie Milwright","original_name":"Katie Milwright","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea2076a66f2d2001a3c36d8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2908924","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
