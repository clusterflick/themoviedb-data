Three women from Australia, Sri Lanka, and Greece meet on a Greek island. All are exiles escaping from their own personal tragedies. Ultimately, it is the island itself, with the generosity and warmth of the islanders, which leads all three women to revelations about themselves and their place in the world.","popularity":0.5568,"poster_path":"/59cR68leZE3dkK3g6QcJKgVCpqI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1989-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Island","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Papas","original_name":"Irene Papas","popularity":0.5207,"profile_path":"/5L9s3RdHpHnexq5tskFwqEQyMIf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marquise","credit_id":"52fe4d15c3a368484e1d6361","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Haywood","original_name":"Chris Haywood","popularity":0.3003,"profile_path":"/4YoZ8aRnDObtxZ9VFvRhunkG1Ha.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Janis","credit_id":"52fe4d15c3a368484e1d6365","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1547789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Sitta","original_name":"Eva Sitta","popularity":0.1028,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6730d85c3c104d88bdc5c594","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3003667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anoja Weerasinghe","original_name":"Anoja Weerasinghe","popularity":0.1021,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6730d86949ad5afefc303bbd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Kaye","original_name":"Norman Kaye","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":"/iwVZinCQWqYAgPRZQBGGSr4La1b.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6730d87149ad5afefc303bc7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1143446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Bernard","original_name":"François Bernard","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6730dc8eac970aad2a8d9ef5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939275,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Cox","original_name":"Paul Cox","popularity":0.2115,"profile_path":"/wMRDxbIIi42Y54gy6NNV3pQ0aNR.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d15c3a368484e1d635d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1397551,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Oliver Streeton","original_name":"Oliver Streeton","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6801e5bd65c00a25a5d928c1","department":"Art","job":"Title Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0097597","wikidata_id":"Q6082951","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/59cR68leZE3dkK3g6QcJKgVCpqI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
