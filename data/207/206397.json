Offered a business license and asked to join the Chamber of Commerce, Lynch opened and maintained his business according to the most rigorous standards available. However, marijuana remains a Class 1 narcotic according to the DEA, and Lynch's business soon became the target of a large Federal investigation. This film explores the horrific descent into hell faced by Mr. Lynch - previously a law abiding citizen without so much as a speeding ticket, as he is cast as a Pablo Escobar and thrown into Federal detention.","popularity":0.0809,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lynching Charlie Lynch","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Ray","original_name":"Rick Ray","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d1cc3a368484e1d7997","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1843978","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
