He immediately becomes convinced that they went together to the movies (instead they went separate ways). Blinded by jealousy, Antonio wants to enter in the cinema hall and make a killing; but the director of the cinema stops him, and goes into the cinema room saying: \"Outside a husband is waiting for his unfaithful wife to come out and kill her. Please, those of you who do not have a clear conscience, go to the emergency exit.\" In a moment almost all the spectators disappear.","popularity":0.3264,"poster_path":"/xvxJMJfeQYl3DZYin9wTynYMA7l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12624,"logo_path":null,"name":"Società Italiana Cines","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1913-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinema Tragedy at Carnival Time","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Cinema Tragedy at Carnival Time","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Une tragédie au cinéma en Carnaval","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Eine Fürchterliche Tragödie im Kino-Theater","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Een treurspel in de bioscoop","type":"informal literal title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ignazio Lupi","original_name":"Ignazio Lupi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Husband","credit_id":"5e87cdc255c1f40018834fb3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pina Menichelli","original_name":"Pina Menichelli","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":"/lKzds3ubxoJPxO8fJeRBuCG0rYs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Wife","credit_id":"5e87cdd060b58d0018e9bcbb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2588709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruto Castellani","original_name":"Bruto Castellani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Cinema Director","credit_id":"5e87cde1b84f940018c8eb9a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enrico Guazzoni","original_name":"Enrico Guazzoni","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/cC4YNUgw4DhcXpK5ijRIBPHyUyw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d22c3a368484e1d8d25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0963348","wikidata_id":"Q20380127","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.625,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xvxJMJfeQYl3DZYin9wTynYMA7l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":931,"name":"jealousy"},{"id":3473,"name":"carnival"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"it\", \"native_name\"=>\"Italian\"}","note":"","release_date":"1913-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Una tragedia al cinematografo (Cines, 1913)","key":"154840586","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2016-02-10T11:26:06.000Z","id":"5e87d04fb84f940014c8edd4"}]}}}
