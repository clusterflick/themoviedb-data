At first Bob enjoys Raoul's presence - in part because Vicky is his not Raoul's and in part because Raoul is a lot of fun. The fun wears thin for Bob as his seriousness and possessiveness take over. When Bob leaves for a few days to settle a labor dispute at his factory, Vicky and Raoul spend time together, Winchell's column implies untoward behavior, Bob barks at Vicky, and that gets her back up. Can things be sorted out? Help comes from Raoul's upright valet, McTavish, and a principled cigarette girl, Joy, whom Raoul picks up.","popularity":0.8523,"poster_path":"/jZyI93YH04cigIkZef4Hek0vBRb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25,"logo_path":"/qZCc1lty5FzX30aOCVRBLzaVmcp.png","name":"20th Century Fox","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love is better the second time around.","title":"Second Honeymoon","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyrone Power","original_name":"Tyrone Power","popularity":0.7428,"profile_path":"/zHKNyYKkWIQBwhqxCMNBns1eoXR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Raoul McLiesh","credit_id":"52fe4d1bc3a368484e1d777b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loretta Young","original_name":"Loretta Young","popularity":0.6628,"profile_path":"/vtpGjZpAK88rTTi9Y7VLGpMyt6m.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Vicky","credit_id":"52fe4d1bc3a368484e1d777f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Erwin","original_name":"Stuart Erwin","popularity":0.8025,"profile_path":"/yO5OCvQmwUsi0WS7kbDUvYCMHQi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Leo MacTavish","credit_id":"52fe4d1bc3a368484e1d7783","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Trevor","original_name":"Claire Trevor","popularity":0.5678,"profile_path":"/9fBt1rbo63Gu7pO7WVo8RizMgUF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Marcia","credit_id":"52fe4d1bc3a368484e1d7787","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjorie Weaver","original_name":"Marjorie Weaver","popularity":0.2131,"profile_path":"/fbctQnhyQvqKA91cqKzLE0Upl9w.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Joy","credit_id":"52fe4d1bc3a368484e1d778b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyle Talbot","original_name":"Lyle Talbot","popularity":0.3967,"profile_path":"/a4rVESEvJg6VRd23M6FLRjlfsta.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bob Benton","credit_id":"52fe4d1bc3a368484e1d778f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
