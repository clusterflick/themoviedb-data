Jetty, having a history of drug abuse and denial, now must confront his own personal demons in order to move forward in his life. Along with his best and only friend; his dog Blackie, he encounters some strange characters during his travels who serve as a constant reminder of what he has been trying to run away from. Jetty finally wakes up and has an epiphany when he encounters a Goblin-Like Figure (Camden Toy) who reminds him that he is the only one who can help himself, and cannot hide from himself any longer.","popularity":0.5733,"poster_path":"/6AX3al1qcHG4T4V4Zw6A0EAU70W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Running Away with Blackie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":208727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"August Emerson","original_name":"August Emerson","popularity":0.1156,"profile_path":"/od01EUK08IGqlkLKv1zdm04dNCw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jetty","credit_id":"52fe4d28c3a368484e1da1a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natasha Lyonne","original_name":"Natasha Lyonne","popularity":1.62,"profile_path":"/2QJoTBEIeYyjGSDot9qxv2ayPH3.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Motel Clerk","credit_id":"52fe4d28c3a368484e1da1ab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Suplee","original_name":"Bill Suplee","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":"/m3Y1LPGax29XKiXq5GwLF1LWW4B.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Motel Drifter","credit_id":"52fe4d28c3a368484e1da1b3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Lilly","original_name":"Scott Lilly","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Boy with Bottle","credit_id":"52fe4d28c3a368484e1da1b7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James F.
