He is 20 and feels like a stranger to himself. He wonders how he can live without dreams or desires. One day, he sees Liv, another college sophomore, and falls secretly and utterly in love with her. When he finally dares to declare his love, he finds himself up against a wall. Liv does not know him. Twenty-year-old Liv loses her virginity to Ilia, an older Russian army deserter. She experiences her first love and treasures every minute. But all too soon, Ilia's past creeps back into his life and unravels their union. One day, he leaves her without a word. She will have to live with the same intolerable loneliness that she unwittingly inflicted on Gregory.","popularity":0.0783,"poster_path":"/hn2UHjEnjRZPuAC1FF8M9XsdqyH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Get Born","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Lognay","original_name":"Pierre Lognay","popularity":0.0915,"profile_path":"/sKLKylWFGCjz6a1mMKPEGrhW1Ux.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gregory","credit_id":"52fe4d20c3a368484e1d8747","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1189100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fleur Lise Heuet","original_name":"Fleur Lise Heuet","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":"/7Lz5dFG6QO0dAkpdusYDKYXcTVb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Liv","credit_id":"52fe4d20c3a368484e1d874b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Castex","original_name":"Eric Castex","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ilia","credit_id":"52fe4d20c3a368484e1d874f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabrice Murgia","original_name":"Fabrice Murgia","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Fabrizio","credit_id":"52fe4d20c3a368484e1d8753","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Spadrille","original_name":"Patrick Spadrille","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Le Belge","credit_id":"52fe4d20c3a368484e1d8757","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Delsemme","original_name":"Philippe Delsemme","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Le frère","credit_id":"52fe4d20c3a368484e1d875b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole Palo","original_name":"Nicole Palo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d20c3a368484e1d8743","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1329352","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hn2UHjEnjRZPuAC1FF8M9XsdqyH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":545}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
