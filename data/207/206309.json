The film's haunting images, evoking teenage love gone wrong, are counterpointed by a series of saccharine torch songs, celebrating falling in love and the end of a masquerade. Through a kind of bathetic synthesis, the dialectic of Eros and Thanatos, love and death, is consummated in the 'morgue' of the forensic archive.","popularity":0.286,"poster_path":"/oBR2NX73tMba77M7R8nfSiFoluE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teenage Babylon...","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Teenage Babylon","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliette Armstrong","original_name":"Juliette Armstrong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"561fcfa49251417f47002179","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caryn Clark","original_name":"Caryn Clark","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"561fcfabc3a3680e24004199","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigette Gale","original_name":"Brigette Gale","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"561fcfb392514171d6003b12","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Harris","original_name":"Dennis Harris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"561fcfbd92514171d4003f10","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anton Marin","original_name":"Anton Marin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"561fcfcb9251417f47002185","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42384,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Graeme Wood","original_name":"Graeme Wood","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e5c81206f98400ae47bcd1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42384,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Graeme Wood","original_name":"Graeme Wood","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d1ac3a368484e1d7443","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0357226","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/znjnpl2fb7r3hAV1iUa7rgcRGQS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jp8N4bHzlqbBpMjJlvjuInSMAsQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cYHN3ZlhPrd7vM27RYBJrfGezdD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/666KwKmIqpI2canY8jX3TUIB5j0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oBR2NX73tMba77M7R8nfSiFoluE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":236,"name":"suicide"},{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"},{"id":249905,"name":"realistic"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
