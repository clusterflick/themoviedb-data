They find some hope when the drug addled Gonzo Kapoor, the son of a famous B movie producer, hires them to write an art house film billed as \"Tarkovsky with orgies\" for his directorial debut. All seems well until Dulal meets Ruma, a beautiful photographer who makes him question his choice to sell out, and the two friends must choose between friendship, love and the chance of a big break. The film delves into the world of young migrant writers, their hopes and their ontological anxiety.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Writers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4249246","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
