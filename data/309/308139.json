In 1890, he presented his recently published collection of Civil War Stories to novelist Gertrude Atherton and fledgling young publisher William Randolph Hearst during an infamous meeting in Sonol, California. This meeting sets the forum for the presentation of three of Bierce's most popular stories including \"One Kind Of Officer\", \"Story Of A Conscience\" and \"An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge.\" This acclaimed collection features epic battle sequences, deeply conflicted drama and the signature \"surprise endings\" that characterized most of the short stories by Ambrose Bierce.","popularity":0.4984,"poster_path":"/dwfpHIENpobvlOysmkdDbxsR6Qt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A country divided, one man at a time...","title":"Ambrose Bierce: Civil War Stories","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Civil War - Ein Krieg kennt keine Helden","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Campbell Scott","original_name":"Campbell Scott","popularity":1.0871,"profile_path":"/lJCxZpQru76zBeuZGxc0Gm5Pm9y.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Ambrose Bierce","credit_id":"54801748c3a36829ab001946","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":234753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Schilling","original_name":"Vivian Schilling","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Gertrude Atherton","credit_id":"548017519251416e810018ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Darrow","original_name":"Nathan Darrow","popularity":0.2488,"profile_path":"/qJJS945MMrFKAfGAknVVc1qwO5u.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"William Randolph Hearst","credit_id":"5480175f9251416e78001900","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T.
