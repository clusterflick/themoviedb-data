The young Julie, a cheerful and somewhat naive blonde, and the slightly older Lisa, a little bitter after the end of a relationship, meet on the Internet and quickly become friends. They decide to go on a weekend trip into the wilderness. Their destination is an old hunting lodge that belongs to Lisa's parents. On the way there, they are threatened by a hillbilly. The hunting lodge also seems to be hiding a secret. The situation comes to a head for both women until a sudden twist changes everything. It's a matter of life and death.","popularity":0.2207,"poster_path":"/8iS8AHYrkdY54qfmujHb5KqTCgD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bertucci
