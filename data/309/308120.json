In that time the Dodgers, and Dodger Stadium specifically, have become a true Bluetopia for their fans; a common passion and sanctuary for the incredibly diverse faces and cultures that make Los Angeles a most remarkable place. Bluetopia weaves the stories of several Dodger fans across the 2008 Dodger season. As the season evolves and ultimately ends with the Dodgers on the threshold of the World Series, lives unfold before us. We meet tattoo artists and attorneys, celebrities and detectives, former inmates and grandmothers, cancer fighters and romantic dreamers. Dodger tradition brings them together as one. Bluetopia goes behind the scenes for the human stories of the team itself. Bluetopia is the story of the powerful and emotional bond between fans and their favorite players; between the world's most diverse city and the team that binds it together. Together they make the most lasting memories of their lives","popularity":0.0995,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bluetopia: The LA Dodgers Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72870,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Timothy Marx","original_name":"Timothy Marx","popularity":0.0845,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"547fec109251416e6c001063","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72870,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Timothy Marx","original_name":"Timothy Marx","popularity":0.0845,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5482cf9d9251416e7b007635","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1414812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1480,"name":"baseball"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BLUETOPIA THE L.A.
