The idyllic landscape we are shown is in fact a series of full-scale inkjet prints, which the artist photographed and used to wallpaper a life-size model of the house for his film set. Actors playing the landlord of the house, the gardener and the neighbors give conflicting accounts of what the terrorists had done there, how they lived, how they ate. More importantly, they question why the group chose to live in a house with floor-to-ceiling glass windows on all sides. This re-imagined scene is typical of Beloufaâ€™s exploration of the hazy shades of narrative, make-believe and truth that underpin the representations of real-world events.","popularity":0.0589,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sans titre","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neil Beloufa","original_name":"Neil Beloufa","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5484641492514168cd0006af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neil Beloufa","original_name":"Neil Beloufa","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5484643992514168ca000649","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1395835,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Guillaume le Grontec","original_name":"Guillaume le Grontec","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60175bc1d266a2003d12cd0f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2115385","wikidata_id":"Q2222501","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
