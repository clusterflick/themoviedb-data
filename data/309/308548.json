In the film, a female typist goes from apathetic to empowered through the help of a man giving out political fliers on the street.  Using John Coltrane’s song “After the Rain,” Ballenger’s narration of the film meditates on rainy days and their impact.  The rain in this short film doesn’t signify defeat, but offers renewal and “a chance to recollect, a cool out.”","popularity":0.0591,"poster_path":"/36AqH4IK4nPvZakzeYU4mMfoVyn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10250,"logo_path":null,"name":"UCLA School of Film and Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rain (Nyesha)","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1395131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evlynne Braithwaite","original_name":"Evlynne Braithwaite","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5482174c9251416e8100694c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1395132,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernard Nicolas","original_name":"Bernard Nicolas","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/32KCaHyXnb9FESaizBi9rfhYsqU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5482176d9251416e7e006b58","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1395134,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ijeoma Iloputaife","original_name":"Ijeoma Iloputaife","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/vPAl8SEWo27uQo75z5dRKJxOpH2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5482179b9251416e6c006151","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1395136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Friend","original_name":"Michael Friend","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"548217bbc3a36817a5006c9a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2252987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Williams","original_name":"Keith Williams","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5c780a3a925141129e670b7e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1395130,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melvonna Ballenger","original_name":"Melvonna Ballenger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"548216e19251416e6c006135","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1395130,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melvonna Ballenger","original_name":"Melvonna Ballenger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"548217309251414d21006a16","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1395130,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melvonna Ballenger","original_name":"Melvonna Ballenger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54821739c3a3685c0e000964","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0184847","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.654,"height":764,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/36AqH4IK4nPvZakzeYU4mMfoVyn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oOlSyJAi2P4GVWhPyhT65PlvJbQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fCsIVJYaZd31xUSanWlCWlg9CpB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"L.A.
