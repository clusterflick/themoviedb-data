When I recollect the impulse for this filming, I remember my desire to show a spiritual quality united with the sensual in my view of this small Greek statue. I chose to reveal the figure solely through its blue early morning highlights and in the orange sunlight of late afternoon. After filming the statue, I walked down to the East River and continued to film near the Manhattan Bridge and the electrical works; then I returned to the apartment and filmed a few other details. I set this film material aside, while continuing to film and edit Pitcher of Colored Light, later I took it up twice to edit but could not find my way. Most of the editing was finally done in 2009; then I waited to see whether it was finished and found that it was not. In May 2010, I made several editing changes and created the soundtrack with thoughts of this friend’s recent death.” (RB)","popularity":0.2915,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Suppliant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beavers","original_name":"Robert Beavers","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/2bYi9uNjaUBwjxFufd67XAZjbqz.jpg","credit_id":"54833c969251414efa00935e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beavers","original_name":"Robert Beavers","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/2bYi9uNjaUBwjxFufd67XAZjbqz.jpg","credit_id":"54833ca192514175f5001c96","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beavers","original_name":"Robert Beavers","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/2bYi9uNjaUBwjxFufd67XAZjbqz.jpg","credit_id":"5a5f840bc3a36877660048c9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5103822","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1025,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tMSmy1kWJ6QdB6t4HhyvMH8Tmcc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1822}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":207427,"name":"statue"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"New York Film Festival","release_date":"2010-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
