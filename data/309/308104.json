An increasing obsession with mysterious fetish objects ultimately results in a tear in the fabric of reality that threatens to turn their respective worlds inside out. A hallucinatory fever dream in which nothing is what it at first appears to be, Sanctum and Sacrum opens a portal between the ancient world of myth and symbol and the banal pastels of a Florida apartment. It is a matrix of transformation, in which the lives of two couples intersect via a web spun from trance-like rituals of desire and the ever present origin of myth.","popularity":0.094,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sanctum and Sacrum","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2360614","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
