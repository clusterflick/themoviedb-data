He teaches third grade, enjoys a good beer, likes to play golf even though he's terrible at it, and currently lives with Nick who's been his best friend since high school. The story begins when Reagan calls Nick in a panic because she and her husband are fighting. Nick tells her to come over, and when she doesn't show up, he goes to her house to make sure she's ok. Instead of finding Reagan, he finds her husband-- dead in their living room. There is blood everywhere, and Reagan and her baby are nowhere to be found. Thinking Reagan has killed her husband, Nick tries to keep her out of trouble by asking Pete to help hide the body. Things quickly spiral out of control. The police get involved and start asking questions, the morgue starts filling up with guys who look exactly like Reagan's dead husband, and Nick is accused of murder. Unsure whether it's all related, Pete struggles between saving his friendship and helping the police catch a killer.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quicksand Castles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1907747","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
