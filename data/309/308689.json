Several scenes in this slow, elegant film betray a certain dry humor -- a child devouring the last of a bowl of yogurt and then crying; a cow getting its head stuck in a pail; and a woman singing to herself, accompanied by her snoring husband. Other scenes capture the nomads' hardscrabble lives -- drunken herdsmen in the grips of existential despair, growling dogs, and a camel enduring a rather grim septum piercing. By the end of the film, the family pulls up stakes and herds its sundry four-legged beasts -- camels, cattle, goats, dogs, and horses -- to a more fertile plain. This film was screened at the 1999 Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival.","popularity":0.3945,"poster_path":"/s9Olmb0Tz1S8A1nJLI3MVsFf5gJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3623,"logo_path":"/v3XJT8ci1OScqcMOqd6uAExJCcV.png","name":"Kazakhfilm Studios","origin_country":"KZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"1995-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Schastye","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Dvortsevoy","original_name":"Sergei Dvortsevoy","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/95ILx1acmNaXmxI5xdHEn1JXR6s.jpg","credit_id":"64e31073e19de9013a296932","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Dvortsevoy","original_name":"Sergei Dvortsevoy","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/95ILx1acmNaXmxI5xdHEn1JXR6s.jpg","credit_id":"64e30e1c076ce843ba7386ad","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238622,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Gennadiy Popov","original_name":"Gennadiy Popov","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652557cdea84c700ca0dea8b","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Dvortsevoy","original_name":"Sergei Dvortsevoy","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/95ILx1acmNaXmxI5xdHEn1JXR6s.jpg","credit_id":"548329879251416e74008d6e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1395459,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Boris Trochev","original_name":"Boris Trochev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"548329ac9251416e780086d0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Dvortsevoy","original_name":"Sergei Dvortsevoy","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/95ILx1acmNaXmxI5xdHEn1JXR6s.jpg","credit_id":"548329b69251416e7e00898a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1395461,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marat Tokhtabakiyev","original_name":"Marat Tokhtabakiyev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"548329d29251416e81008815","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Dvortsevoy","original_name":"Sergei Dvortsevoy","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/95ILx1acmNaXmxI5xdHEn1JXR6s.jpg","credit_id":"548329029251416e74008d67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0228700","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.733,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s9Olmb0Tz1S8A1nJLI3MVsFf5gJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550},{"aspect_ratio":0.62,"height":2244,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u9FYZkReNabuXfEAQPfCRYs1Dkw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1392}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2475,"name":"kazakhstan"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
