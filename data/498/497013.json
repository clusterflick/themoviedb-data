The director’s decision to leave the family’s faith results in an ultimatum from her mother, a devout Jehovah’s Witness: either return to Jehovah or never see her again. As the choices are revealed, the film discovers what has been lost and questions why subsequent generations often repeat the past.","popularity":0.0511,"poster_path":"/nqeiXr5mLtyr0WGmCeLZEbvsX9Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last of the Last Days","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1955868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan Inman","original_name":"Jordan Inman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a52acda92514113300279c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1808213,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stacey Woelfel","original_name":"Stacey Woelfel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1430cec3a36853400017e6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1955868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan Inman","original_name":"Jordan Inman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1430dec3a368535800178f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":929343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Greene","original_name":"Robert Greene","popularity":0.1386,"profile_path":"/hdbNcE7mlwaXslOJwX6IC9VrT2k.jpg","credit_id":"5b1430bfc3a368533a000a8a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1955868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan Inman","original_name":"Jordan Inman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b1430ecc3a368535d001d22","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6928818","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nqeiXr5mLtyr0WGmCeLZEbvsX9Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":658}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Stronger Than Fiction FIlm Festival","release_date":"2017-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"First Look 2018","release_date":"2018-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
