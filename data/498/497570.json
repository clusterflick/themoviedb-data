He’s had mental problems ever since the day he ruined his chance at being a DVD commentator. During the featurette for a favorite noir classic, he committed an unspeakable, unnatural act. Now his shrink is suggesting he take a small vacation to get away from it all. Running out of gas, Connor comes across a fallen crossing guard, a psychotic with a pick axe, a young lady named Distosia, who is studying to be part of a cult, one of his favorite soap stars, and a young man he once photographed in the nude. All of this leads to a kind of psychotic breakdown where Connor’s sexual dysfunction manifests itself in more and more bizarre ways. Eventually, there’s nothing left to do but dance and sing. Besides, life’s not too bad when you think about it.","popularity":0.3169,"poster_path":"/4VL60HbKuu4n9pv3pSyzYGEVthd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's All Not So Tragic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miles Dougal","original_name":"Miles Dougal","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Greg","credit_id":"61f25e743009aa00ddeebaae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Petting Zoo Man","credit_id":"61f25ea1e48860001e05ec6a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","credit_id":"5a563abf9251417a9702500b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4VL60HbKuu4n9pv3pSyzYGEVthd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
