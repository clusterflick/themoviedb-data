The film probes the face of mourning and grief – its digital embodiment, transmission, and representation. It asks how the gaze gets channeled within the digital realm, and how empathy travels. Equally, how the documentary signifier – and its abstraction – operate when viewing suffering. What exactly is viewing suffering ‘at a distance’ – and how many meters or kilometers is that? What is the behavior and political economy of the image of war? Who is the ‘local’ in the representation of war? What is the daily routine of those who represent war?","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/5dVmgGa5l9WVX69ZCHbA8pXHk5c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Things Occur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lara Abu Ramadan","original_name":"Lara Abu Ramadan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Lara Abu Ramadan (voice)","credit_id":"5a5797c19251413ae1000ed9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hosam Salem","original_name":"Hosam Salem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Hosam Salem (voice)","credit_id":"5a5797cdc3a36825a8000f7a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khalil Hamra","original_name":"Khalil Hamra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Khalil Hamra (voice)","credit_id":"5a5797d9c3a36825b6000e76","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walaa Al Ghussein","original_name":"Walaa Al Ghussein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Walaa Al Ghussein (voice)","credit_id":"5a5797e20e0a2669ce000f3d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashraf Al Masri","original_name":"Ashraf Al Masri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ashraf Al Masri (voice)","credit_id":"5a5797ec0e0a2669c8000f5c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oraib Toukan","original_name":"Oraib Toukan","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a5796d09251413ae3000dea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5dVmgGa5l9WVX69ZCHbA8pXHk5c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2017-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
