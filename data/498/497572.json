Apparently, unwitting parents (including a particularly proud gay couple) have hired the semi-retarded redneck nanny under the pretense that he takes good care of his toddler charges. Instead, Plop beats and humiliates the children, taking out his own sad mental issues out on them. Thanks to an ex-girlfriend. However, the cops are hot on his trail. It won’t be long before the long arm of the law, or a mangled baby with a can of soup, ends Plop’s cruel crime spree once and for all.","popularity":0.3007,"poster_path":"/2smreRHAtOA6XbdjBZhkg2bRAnv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Babysitter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miles Dougal","original_name":"Miles Dougal","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60fe78a3e24b93002e400ee7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walt Dongo","original_name":"Walt Dongo","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60fe78b0db72c0005d7e3229","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Tyree","original_name":"Bill Tyree","popularity":0.0411,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60fe78b5e24b930048f8c7b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Patterson","original_name":"Walter Patterson","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60fe78c2f8595800271c66db","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3108880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Wells","original_name":"Greg Wells","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"6101cb6a7d5f4b005e820494","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiffany Naylor","original_name":"Tiffany Naylor","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"60fe78cc38e5100074936cff","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3172499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marybeth Spychalski","original_name":"Marybeth Spychalski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"60fe78d41684f7005f09735f","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","credit_id":"60fe79322fdec6007f25c947","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","credit_id":"60fe790b38e510005df02848","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miles Dougal","original_name":"Miles Dougal","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fe78fb7ad08c002d6d43c9","department":"Sound","job":"Songs"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","credit_id":"60fe792a85c0a2005de21f3e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50583,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adam Rifkin","original_name":"Adam Rifkin","popularity":0.4821,"profile_path":"/hDXT7Hx3MU3XT2W6MvBqlxAPm3E.jpg","credit_id":"60fe78eaa58902005d6f6196","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","credit_id":"60fe79142fdec6005de095b7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","credit_id":"60fe791b2fdec6007f25c93e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","credit_id":"5a563be50e0a2607e8026793","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33090071","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":1062,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2smreRHAtOA6XbdjBZhkg2bRAnv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
