Literally living off his one recognizable moment in the TV cop show Boys in Blue (he played a TV stealing criminal), he spends his days hustling, his nights arguing with his live-in companion, a transvestite Christian rock wannabe. After a beer can robbery goes wrong, Bronze gets his songwriting pal an audition. When that falls through, he hits rock bottom. A bout with cellphone-induced ear cancer and an incident with a haphazardly thrown can of soup seals his sad fate.","popularity":0.2957,"poster_path":"/yzo6mj5er5PhK9fEwvW9VJcWXdi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Actor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miles Dougal","original_name":"Miles Dougal","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Bronze Bronzeman","credit_id":"66fe2e8ffa3e69e0ef7c78e2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walt Dongo","original_name":"Walt Dongo","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Pew","credit_id":"66fe2ea4e48014914684ce7e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1144919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Tyree","original_name":"Bill Tyree","popularity":0.0411,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bufo the Casting Director","credit_id":"66fe2eb6b146282f7b84cc6c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Patterson","original_name":"Walter Patterson","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66fe2ec5e48014914684ce88","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3108880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Wells","original_name":"Greg Wells","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66fe2ed6925fdf925b7c78d6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiffany Naylor","original_name":"Tiffany Naylor","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Only Hooker in Town","credit_id":"66fe2eefe84eeb35a0f7be97","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3163560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sir 'Bigfoot' George","original_name":"Sir 'Bigfoot' George","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"BigFoot","credit_id":"66fe2f029ebea19006f7c62a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3163559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joey Murcia","original_name":"Joey Murcia","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Benny","credit_id":"66fe2f14b146282f7b84cc89","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4977664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rocky Suicidal Mary","original_name":"Rocky Suicidal Mary","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"66fe2f43b146282f7b84cca2","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"66fe3058b146282f7b84cccf","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3172499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marybeth Spychalski","original_name":"Marybeth Spychalski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"66fe3499e84eeb35a0f7bf78","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","credit_id":"5a563b710e0a2607e00260a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50583,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adam Rifkin","original_name":"Adam Rifkin","popularity":0.4821,"profile_path":"/hDXT7Hx3MU3XT2W6MvBqlxAPm3E.jpg","credit_id":"66fe2f62b146282f7b84cca8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","credit_id":"66ff60cd1592ef1ba9850336","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yzo6mj5er5PhK9fEwvW9VJcWXdi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
