Lucie Baud, one of the pioneers of the women's movement, went with creativity, fighting spirit and the power of singing against the weapons of male-dominated capitalist society in nineteenth-century France. The film, based on true events, describes the ambitious fight of a silk moth. She stood up for the rights of the female working class to end maltreatment and oppression once and for all. For the revolution in women's rights, she even put her family back and fought to the end for their beliefs.","popularity":0.5611,"poster_path":"/cXdvOZ9Jmd0qcADj4BWoo1SrPvP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26568,"logo_path":null,"name":"JPG
