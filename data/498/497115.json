During a trip with his peasant lover, the second son of the Count, Willy, has a fatal accident.  Kitty followers her painter-bum to Italy.  One day, during a dramatic hunting party at the Eagle’s Nest, Count Egge goes blind.

After coming to terms with his kids, he finds inner peace in the bosom of his ancestral seat, shrouded in secrets:  Castle Hubertus.","popularity":0.1323,"poster_path":"/wTDKS112SNRyTTlmFumQj0PyLL2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85289,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dialog Film","origin_country":""},{"id":12372,"logo_path":"/lcQScIQXHQXuLMLFQt0loJl5gWJ.png","name":"UFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1934-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schloß Hubertus","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Deppe","original_name":"Hans Deppe","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":"/4izzHQgMQFCfxmaf8QSOOsHvWB0.jpg","credit_id":"5a538f560e0a260260036ff7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50891,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ludwig Ganghofer","original_name":"Ludwig Ganghofer","popularity":0.144,"profile_path":"/iqrnU67tZtooJHaVETbWhumDTiK.jpg","credit_id":"5d74affdc6006d000f48266e","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28052,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philipp Lothar Mayring","original_name":"Philipp Lothar Mayring","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d74afd42ea6b90011bf55c0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1468958,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Willy Rath","original_name":"Willy Rath","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d74aff1c6006d0012482b48","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":49245,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Ostermayr","original_name":"Peter Ostermayr","popularity":0.049,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d74afe5d19a33697e1198bd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0025751","wikidata_id":"Q5927755","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wTDKS112SNRyTTlmFumQj0PyLL2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":861,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AibDVvGWn2v0jGtwvyZJu2F1Cxa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":574}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1934-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
