Some members of the Jewish community joined them. A surprising number, more mystically inclined, did not. This French film takes us to one remote Polish estate, where patriots are arming themselves to fight Germans. Several Jews who sought to join them are admitted by the group's leader, but they are violently dealt with by the other anti-Semitic members of the group.","popularity":0.2341,"poster_path":"/d6TFBoz5QDWvCcbzxdqEhRIk2WO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Tear in the Ocean","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1956451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Stere","original_name":"Alexandre Stere","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Edi Rubin","credit_id":"5a53f7ecc3a3685ee6002055","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Rollin","original_name":"Dominique Rollin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bynie","credit_id":"5a53f7f8c3a3685ecd0022d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1298635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armand Abplanalp","original_name":"Armand Abplanalp","popularity":0.0688,"profile_path":"/9aBYsX1AbZPnt4sdfrM3ake8fR7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Roman Skarbek","credit_id":"5a53f8070e0a2607d400227f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1706184,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henri Glaeser","original_name":"Henri Glaeser","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Rabbi","credit_id":"5a53f8139251417aaf002098","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Zardi","original_name":"Dominique Zardi","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":"/go1b6s9ZOwbBRUfWZztrJsxOcPF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Yanouch","credit_id":"5a53f8220e0a2607d70023be","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1956452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Brafman","original_name":"Jacques Brafman","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mendel","credit_id":"5a53f82bc3a3685ec7002144","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1706175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frantz Wolf","original_name":"Frantz Wolf","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The SS Commander","credit_id":"5a53f83e0e0a2607e800243f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":36513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liliane Rovère","original_name":"Liliane Rovère","popularity":0.4585,"profile_path":"/mo7NTceScg2S8YByd9Nc5jCsdfm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"The Commander's Mistress","credit_id":"5a53f843c3a3685ecd002315","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1706184,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henri Glaeser","original_name":"Henri Glaeser","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a53f74d0e0a2607e40023a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39245,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Claude Lecomte","original_name":"Claude Lecomte","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4cb0169a3c49001634521b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2543299,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alec-Pierre Quince","original_name":"Alec-Pierre Quince","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4cb00b1e92250015c76ac0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310272,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Georges Arnstam","original_name":"Georges Arnstam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4cb0201e92250018c7e106","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0153438","wikidata_id":"Q30740295","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d6TFBoz5QDWvCcbzxdqEhRIk2WO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
