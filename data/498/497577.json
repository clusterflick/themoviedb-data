In a dusty hotel room, a depressed husband (Lloyd Kaufman) reads a \"Dear John\" letter from his long suffering spouse. In another location, an old man (Tyree) tells the tale of his randy rollercoaster existence -- and the hunchback son he fathered. In a trailer across town, a recluse (Vietnam Ron) is loosing his eyesight and reflects on his failed relationship with his blonde bimbo wife (Maryanne Spychalski). Elsewhere, a flamboyant real estate agent entertains clients and friends in a tumble down track house. Together they form the spine of a storyline that shifts between scatological discussions of intestinal gas and equally meaningful mediations on contentment, and the pursuit of friendship.","popularity":0.2704,"poster_path":"/7ca2Mj6mgtw8e9diOzfQN7oOiEI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Okie Dokie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lloyd Kaufman","original_name":"Lloyd Kaufman","popularity":0.5372,"profile_path":"/4jNIqeZBK2YbpPupBhl4l1moQn5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a563e200e0a2607e8026a0a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vietnam Ron","original_name":"Vietnam Ron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a563e37c3a3685ec70246b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1957448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maryanne Spychalski","original_name":"Maryanne Spychalski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5a563e430e0a2607e00263f9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Andrews","original_name":"Giuseppe Andrews","popularity":0.4807,"profile_path":"/lQrnST9P6aRbxAs2eQiCkkBY83v.jpg","credit_id":"5a563e12c3a3685ee6023ac6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33201721","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.67,"height":760,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ca2Mj6mgtw8e9diOzfQN7oOiEI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":509}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
