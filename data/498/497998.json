It is a film, where two sisters from Lithuania - a filmmaker and a photographer - take a journey through their German grandmother's past. During the research authors encounter her love story, fleeing, uncomfort of being German in Soviet Lithuania and chain of suicides in their family. It's time to talk. About everything. Long journey, which leads in two directions - towards other person and yourself.","popularity":0.0541,"poster_path":"/jFCKKohcuZsblYbq5ZdWnENPFDD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76214,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dagstar Film","origin_country":""},{"id":19118,"logo_path":"/eM2bob2r7Zmwlbx5YPSeqs4Vm1X.png","name":"Tremora","origin_country":"LT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2017-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What We Leave Behind","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","title":"Mociute, Guten Tag!","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1414588,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Markus Aust","original_name":"Markus Aust","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65077018373ac200e21b1f59","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1329071,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ieva Norvilienė","original_name":"Ieva Norvilienė","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65077010109dec00eb16acb5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4277345,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marius Steponenas","original_name":"Marius Steponenas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6507703afa27f400eb17dea9","department":"Crew","job":"Editorial Staff"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2886581,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Lukas Zapereckas","original_name":"Lukas Zapereckas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6507702d109dec012d8946a1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1598576,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Audrius Zelenius","original_name":"Audrius Zelenius","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6507701f109dec010cc22a40","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1651122,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dagmar Niehage","original_name":"Dagmar Niehage","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650770018a88b200c6acfd5a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1635416,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vilma Samulionytė","original_name":"Vilma Samulionytė","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a58fd960e0a2634ef00ea82","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1635415,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jūratė Samulionytė","original_name":"Jūratė Samulionytė","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a58fd8b0e0a2634fe00ece6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1635415,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jūratė Samulionytė","original_name":"Jūratė Samulionytė","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a58fc6d925141020600db2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7588062","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ylodnozNnDnGYRUwEnRVIb5cCO3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jFCKKohcuZsblYbq5ZdWnENPFDD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Močiute, guten tag (Liebe Oma, Guten Tag)","key":"PjgoYOlwA1w","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-11-04T03:10:09.000Z","id":"5c7e5dc1925141277a16ac0b"}]}}}
