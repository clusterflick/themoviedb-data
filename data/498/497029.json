Not only that, but her husband has died, and she needs to get his body back to his hometown for burial and she is getting no help from the state. The would-be robbers good-naturedly agree to help her, and have a series of odd adventures involving the old lady, the corpse, and themselves. Eventually, the old lady dies as well, and they are really in a pickle.","popularity":0.2271,"poster_path":"/mLK4pXtke8xT7IPRB7hpWTxGQYm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le
