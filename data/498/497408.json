Jaroslav Kvapil’s libretto inspired Dvorak to compose a masterpiece, a compelling opera full of poignant lyricism and dramatic twists. Ádám Fisher and Stefan Herheim masterfully presented this ‘lyrical fairytale’ at La Monnaie in 2008. In this widely acclaimed interpretation, the fairytale elements sometimes assume frighteningly realistic dimensions so that one might see this enchanting production as a psychoanalytical study of male fantasies and female archetypes.","popularity":0.1975,"poster_path":"/VtP26bthUPEVs85YPAexo7Loje.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oper Graz","origin_country":""},{"id":82718,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Munt / La Monnaie","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":152,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rusalka","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1601936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myrtò Papatanasiu","original_name":"Myrtò Papatanasiu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/hiokBMu0MNyrBfPDCnzZDHrtA2e.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Rusalka","credit_id":"5a552c64c3a3685ebc015906","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willard White","original_name":"Willard White","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":"/bsq1Sw3uJJUmKXa34LEtLi0kEIC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Vodnik","credit_id":"5a552c810e0a2607ec0175bd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2130274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavel Cernoch","original_name":"Pavel Cernoch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/kmMiSb2jQXlQjpDU1Rj7ll95n0q.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"The prince","credit_id":"5c5339aac3a368576a99cb3f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1654486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Morloc","original_name":"Renée Morloc","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jezibaba","credit_id":"5a552c8b9251417a9d0168d2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2231274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annalena Persson","original_name":"Annalena Persson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"The foreign prince","credit_id":"5c533a05c3a36874b9875100","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1564911,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ádám Fischer","original_name":"Ádám Fischer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/iNL3ETqc6rVhdcKDAAzPKsXycdC.jpg","credit_id":"5a552cac9251417ab5016914","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willy Vanduren","original_name":"Willy Vanduren","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c53390ec3a368729083e3d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2231269,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Heike Scheele","original_name":"Heike Scheele","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c53391ec3a368576a99c9e1","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569361,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonín Dvořák","original_name":"Antonín Dvořák","popularity":0.1161,"profile_path":"/uc5bnNVPdBToTS3twGQJ83SyQPh.jpg","credit_id":"5c53393b0e0a265e19cf7ac5","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365850,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jaroslav Kvapil","original_name":"Jaroslav Kvapil","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/th0dPzVOTqBj81J2IQ0oHsGxGLS.jpg","credit_id":"5c53394d92514154485e98ba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1529449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Herheim","original_name":"Stefan Herheim","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd6984dc3a36817d2c0f7c4","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14849442","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2149,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qXLtQYJsgzRy5imPM3KNypzoGEw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3820}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1441,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/VtP26bthUPEVs85YPAexo7Loje.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3mzLXCPuJiRJtbE0CJ9T3L52MIu.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cs","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"La Monnaie: Dvořák: Rusalka","key":"S50vsBB-hEE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","published_at":"2014-05-27T07:53:48.000Z","official":false,"id":"5c533b0ec3a3684793997146"}]}}}
