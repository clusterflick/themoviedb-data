As Raymond (Richard Bohringer) sits on a ledge of his apartment building, and people try to talk him back inside, he remembers the events of his day and his life before this moment. Things seemed to be going along well enough until something triggered his revulsion at the pettiness and falseness that is the everyday currency of life.","popularity":0.342,"poster_path":"/9513GDYLddF7rfT7h90hlfs0WkQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saga","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":98279,"logo_path":null,"name":"Service de la Recherche de l'ORTF","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":17763,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunchild Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1973-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Italian of the Roses","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Bohringer","original_name":"Richard Bohringer","popularity":0.3499,"profile_path":"/v6372ku0d2Y28zUJ7mGrwaNQ04g.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Raymond Menardi, the Italian","credit_id":"5a5402eac3a3685ecd002df3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1446343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Mercanton","original_name":"Isabelle Mercanton","popularity":0.0465,"profile_path":"/uKf4f5gsfJiExzJwrGSKmVIWB5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lola, the fiancé","credit_id":"5a5402f2c3a3685ec30026ee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":295250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chantal Darget","original_name":"Chantal Darget","popularity":0.1731,"profile_path":"/6IW6JeLdU6SrPCRGvslC7WCNfxe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Paule","credit_id":"5a5403019251417ab5002c52","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Santini","original_name":"Pierre Santini","popularity":0.1281,"profile_path":"/gDHcr2WRFdrNwY2nXoPbxzVMeSJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Raoul, the friend of the bride and groom","credit_id":"5a54030b9251417ab5002c5e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cécile Vassort","original_name":"Cécile Vassort","popularity":0.2221,"profile_path":"/dIcxp1l7J6RMAwqrPlKtRo4HZbO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The bride","credit_id":"5a54031e0e0a2607e0002f08","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1960069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Claude Breton","original_name":"Marie-Claude Breton","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/tY5GH89p415rnZTmrON1XpC95JE.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Claire","credit_id":"65e7245aef8b320185d81e62","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Brincourt","original_name":"François Brincourt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The groom","credit_id":"5a5403250e0a2607e8002ece","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Girod","original_name":"Francis Girod","popularity":0.1084,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Henry, Paule's husband","credit_id":"5a54033f0e0a2607e8002ee8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1956467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Popaul Matton","original_name":"Popaul Matton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"A child in the crowd","credit_id":"5a5403450e0a2607e0002f30","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":544583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Matton","original_name":"Charles Matton","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a54024c0e0a2607e0002e0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0245974","wikidata_id":"Q3204366","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sVTtTQN3IvBLfgYGG5m5il8iufy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1682,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9513GDYLddF7rfT7h90hlfs0WkQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1185}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
