This documentary uses interviews and newsreel footage to examine the conflict between the French and the Vietnamese. In addition to Vietnam, French Indochina also included Cambodia and Laos. The French-Indochina War lasted from 1946 to 1956, when a Geneva Conference agreement mandated a cease-fire in a temporarily divided Vietnam. It is well to note that it is only after this time that the two Vietnams went to war against each other.","popularity":0.1231,"poster_path":"/1a1gtcGjJ46p43x1fTK4k2K5AKG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La république est morte à Diên Biên Phu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1898376,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jérôme Kanapa","original_name":"Jérôme Kanapa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a52bd6dc3a368751c0289cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1955906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Devillers","original_name":"Philippe Devillers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a52bd56925141132902856b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1955907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Lacouture","original_name":"Jean Lacouture","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/bkynORmrOp47oxlqV3z356SKEvI.jpg","credit_id":"5a52bd809251411326026c33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2123220","wikidata_id":"Q94328276","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/1a1gtcGjJ46p43x1fTK4k2K5AKG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
