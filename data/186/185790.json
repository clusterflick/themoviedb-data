But whereas the Milanese media mogul's spells as president were notable for the cynical degradation of his nation's television output, with its bawdy game-shows earning much overseas derision, the small broadcaster showcased here evidently foregrounded and documented local grass-roots political shenanigans.  With no commentary or captions, the film plunges us into a lively day-before-yesterday epoch when the authorities' battles with the Mafia produced an atmosphere akin to Civil War on the streets. Virtuouso editing knits together a dizzyingly wide range of sights and sounds that consistently fascinate and impress.","popularity":0.0611,"poster_path":"/cJhvQD3LYZaVQlEtc98FJtNTOZu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2011-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Anthropological Television Myth","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandro Gagliardo","original_name":"Alessandro Gagliardo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ceb9251416c75129e61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168399,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Helene Bertino","original_name":"Maria Helene Bertino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ceb9251416c75129e55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dario Castelli","original_name":"Dario Castelli","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ceb9251416c75129e5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandro Gagliardo","original_name":"Alessandro Gagliardo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a28b90a6a4c1012ba4685a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2356370","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uihqqzhUYv9w9DNdnbhccCocYNd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cJhvQD3LYZaVQlEtc98FJtNTOZu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Torino Film Festival","release_date":"2011-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
