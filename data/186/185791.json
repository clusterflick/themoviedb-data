Inside, it is like a small city, with businesses and services abound. The prisoners make their living inside the enclosure as they would outside. There is a strong self-organization that plans every-body's lives. As if it weren't enough, there are hundreds of women, wives of the inmates, and almost 300 children, who chose to share their captivity. They are non-convicted beings that accepted living behind bars with the only purpose of preserving a united family. The documentary shows the life of a family inside the jail of La Paz.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/iUfQoOAhrzU3IotVonQb1TQbvTC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BO","name":"Bolivia"}],"release_date":"2012-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Citadel","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"監獄是我家","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Mondaca","original_name":"Diego Mondaca","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ceb9251416c75129e6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Mondaca","original_name":"Diego Mondaca","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6008ef49d55c3d00406a8c33","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2432910","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.694,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iUfQoOAhrzU3IotVonQb1TQbvTC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Taiwan International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2012-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
