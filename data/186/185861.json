Suwa sends a letter to a Korean actress (Kim Ho-jung) he has worked with in the past requesting her assistance to write and direct a film about Hiroshima. Ho-jung arrives at her hotel and is told to explore the city and wait for Suwa. Initially confused, Ho-Jung soon finds the city mesmerizing and spends days learning about the tragic bombing and the effects that are still felt in the city today.  With sparse dialogue and just a handful of characters, Suwa uses black and white images of Hiroshima to convey the scope of the tragedy. In one particularly poignant moment, the voice of a mother is heard lamenting the fact that she had scolded her daughter the day of the bombing. We next see Ho-jung crying in her hotel room, ignoring the ringing phone.","popularity":0.1351,"poster_path":"/wVUFvGhYVpWqLcpu8p667oDLUXA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86670,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kirishima 1945","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Letter from Hiroshima","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":126741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Ho-jung","original_name":"김호정","popularity":0.2845,"profile_path":"/caHnuEvLd9hISvhsQrx9NvNNIHC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"603bbe4ecb5c8e004e23f236","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuhiro Suwa","original_name":"諏訪敦彦","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":"/xTXWND8tMN23Ym5fG4dnbh3lpNC.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ced9251416c7512a23d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wVUFvGhYVpWqLcpu8p667oDLUXA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
