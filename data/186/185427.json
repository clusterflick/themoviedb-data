Why? Because his wife, family and doctor say he should. But Pablo is a stubborn man. He has worked in the mercury mines of Almadén, Spain, risking his life daily. He has had five severe heart attacks and smoked 20 Winston's a day since he was 12. Now in his seventies, Pablo spends most of his day in front of the TV, surrounded by a cloud of smoke, with his back turned firmly towards a village that has lived through better times. Pablo represents the last generation of Almadén mercury miners, an age-old profession with over 2,000 years of history. Through a straightforward depiction of life's everyday moments, Pablo's Winter explores the decay of the local mining culture, but above all, pays homage to its real protagonists: the miners and their families.","popularity":0.0671,"poster_path":"/gBSTppseXZq4f1md32nHAkz5o5u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159087,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opa Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pablo's Winter","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1208930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chico Pereira","original_name":"Chico Pereira","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56b76d4e9251414c45006e49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2448866","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/gBSTppseXZq4f1md32nHAkz5o5u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":855}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
