Since Cristina's birth, he feels he has lost the privileged position of \"prince\" of the house for his eight months old sister. So, with his brother Juan, who is eight years old and is quite disobedient, spend their time committing prank after prank, causing the resulting anger of his mother, the nanny and the old housemaid. The rest of the family members are two much older brothers, his resigned mother and a retrograde father of authoritarian ideas. But many years have passed, and the civil war that won the despot Don Pablo is simply for their children \"Dad's war\".","popularity":0.2656,"poster_path":"/8rOTiM7ByVYRbloDI2UIjGRVS9L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La guerra de papá","video":false,"vote_average":5.333,"vote_count":18,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lolo García","original_name":"Lolo García","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/iPw3kup8UNDdZ4iV8mqOtP3x8KW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Quico","credit_id":"52fe4ce29251416c75128a19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":54146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Verónica Forqué","original_name":"Verónica Forqué","popularity":0.5246,"profile_path":"/m9NIBixFvxqz4UdFlSe68A3Ogwx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Vitora","credit_id":"52fe4ce29251416c75128a1d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Gimpera","original_name":"Teresa Gimpera","popularity":0.1836,"profile_path":"/4GyMWHQ3wLagY1Pp0wI3o56iKlU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mamá","credit_id":"52fe4ce29251416c75128a21","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Héctor Alterio","original_name":"Héctor Alterio","popularity":0.1693,"profile_path":"/wwK95YtxNd1VuaUncPO5qvZq1L2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Papá","credit_id":"52fe4ce29251416c75128a25","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vicente Parra","original_name":"Vicente Parra","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/venbFpsuk1P7Uqkkr78VyzAIPH0.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Emilio","credit_id":"52fe4ce29251416c75128a29","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tito Valverde","original_name":"Tito Valverde","popularity":0.3457,"profile_path":"/1Xj7ih7Ya1CqjPykCsKE4EaknrY.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Eusebio","credit_id":"6153be4fe18b97002c3b0fc9","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007551,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Mercero","original_name":"Antonio Mercero","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/7MNwrnTwsWpyus7OKbmTH3xapHI.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ce29251416c75128a15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":579821,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Miguel Delibes","original_name":"Miguel Delibes","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c6bfcfeec5b500c5f22661","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0076116","wikidata_id":"Q5966875","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jJ4k331D7JwxWBs4d9HD5GvfJGk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1602},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dW21z82nrN4qN9IzZUFg3VT16ux.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1424}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":850,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/8rOTiM7ByVYRbloDI2UIjGRVS9L.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":2836,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/wkIyRcFxKMhDMRbSm8RfluNrRjY.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2080,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/iTW9R8ABLCaFXqf3GpESjqjkkbs.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":1387}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
