So remote is this famous wreckage that only a small handful of explorers and scientists have dared to make the dangerous journey down to her decks.  However, now we too can explore what is left of the mighty  ship.  Using special remote submersibles to glide through the living spaces of the Titanic, viewers witness the current condition of the ballrooms, hallways and living quarters of this famous vessel.  In addition, this unique programme reveals what each room was like before the tragedy.  On a guided tour of the ship, the stories of the inhabitants of each room are told.  Around each corner, the grandeur that made this ship the pride of the White Star Line brings home the poignant story of those who spent their last moments aboard.","popularity":0.4063,"poster_path":"/rYaLfXBkzAhJA2AYjGZHPjx35gM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6790,"logo_path":"/A0TzRpnwLcUcNgrvDJ0BIajf56b.png","name":"Discovery","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bringing The Legend Back To Life","title":"Deep Inside The Titanic","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Dentro del Titanic : El fantasma de las profundidades","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2078783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Corey","original_name":"Dave Corey","popularity":0.1346,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"649a66502975ca00c882b0ca","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670021,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeff Holland","original_name":"Jeff Holland","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649a64fbd35dea00cb038355","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2813246,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bob Anderson","original_name":"Bob Anderson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649a65222975ca00c882b001","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839701,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Burns","original_name":"Steve Burns","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649a65567e348300ff824ec0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rómulo Guardia","original_name":"Rómulo Guardia","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649a65697e348300acc34b26","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4133335,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Nero","original_name":"Steve Nero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649a657e0e5aba0139de4154","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Whalen","original_name":"Michael Whalen","popularity":0.1933,"profile_path":"/777g45rM5761jPg8CVWDxW1qt7m.jpg","credit_id":"649a65a8a6ddcb00c69e94f3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4133336,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dominic Peyton","original_name":"Dominic Peyton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649a65bbfed59700ea0967cc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2900830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul-Henri Nargeolet","original_name":"Paul-Henri Nargeolet","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649a66347e348300c563c9b0","department":"Camera","job":"Set Photographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1513752","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.689,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rYaLfXBkzAhJA2AYjGZHPjx35gM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1034},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/zcuHRyPU56XyoZkwj2Nclf5Uysi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
