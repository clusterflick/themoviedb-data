In this photo study, Ted talks about his store, the customers who have come and gone and the social changes his multicultural neighbourhood has seen. But most of all he wonders what will become of his store after he retires. He hopes his daughter will take over, but she wants to move away. The film is a wistful rendering of a shopkeeper's relationship with his daughter and a fascinating portrait of a neighbourhood and its inhabitants.","popularity":0.2058,"poster_path":"/pZ9ycQPkPtJ8Cz9wo4OQTxcPvwB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1982-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ted Baryluk's Grocery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Baryluk","original_name":"Ted Baryluk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63d1986d66ae4d00c1cf039f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168289,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mike Mirus","original_name":"Mike Mirus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ce99251416c75129857","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":947450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Paskievich","original_name":"John Paskievich","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ce99251416c7512985d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":947450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Paskievich","original_name":"John Paskievich","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d19897cb71b800a10cef1b","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168289,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mike Mirus","original_name":"Mike Mirus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d198a95a07f500a296de76","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":947450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Paskievich","original_name":"John Paskievich","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d198b066ae4d009e9e5630","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168289,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mike Mirus","original_name":"Mike Mirus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d198b955b0c0007f00e02f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1069454,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wolf Koenig","original_name":"Wolf Koenig","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/lwUJrNgPIMytPg8FZzjDdHOwzNH.jpg","credit_id":"63d198c15a07f500a296de7b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":947450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Paskievich","original_name":"John Paskievich","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1996455b0c0007cebad07","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168289,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mike Mirus","original_name":"Mike Mirus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1996b55b0c0009d73f424","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1393811,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leon Johnson","original_name":"Leon Johnson","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1997666ae4d0096b6a3ca","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1727391,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Cameron Gaul","original_name":"Cameron Gaul","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1997d9f51af00829a03f9","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1644533,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Raymond Dumas","original_name":"Raymond Dumas","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d19986e72fe800e9e61895","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354861,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Pierre Joutel","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Joutel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d19993a410c811e9be6a3a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058623,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael J.F.
