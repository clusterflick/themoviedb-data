Rescued from oblivion in drawers, basements and attics, this footage shows daily family life unfolding alongside events that would shape the country. “The whole idea here is there is no one Israeli narrative,” said producer Arik Bernstein in an interview, “This is no official history. It’s not a left-wing look at history, or a right-wing look. These are personal histories — little moments that make up a whole and show something of who we are.”","popularity":0.0884,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Israel: A Home Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eliav Lilti","original_name":"Eliav Lilti","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cdf9251416c75128475","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2570676","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
