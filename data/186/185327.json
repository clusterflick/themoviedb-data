Szlingerbaum felt that the only way he could relate the story of his family’s search for refuge after World War II was in Yiddish. This Belgian-based filmmaker, deeply impacted by New York experimental cinema, gives us a masterful blend of powerful drama and stark documentary to tell the story of postwar European Jewry. Home, as it had been, no longer exists, and all that Samy’s family wants is a place in which to sink new roots.","popularity":0.2336,"poster_path":"/4x7LELLV6eY2URKAOvHrPFETK4R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradise Films","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1982-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brussels-Transit","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","title":"Dakh-Brisel","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hélène Lapiower","original_name":"Hélène Lapiower","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/uuinLTfu7FjUmEAesGu53RderT2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee5fc43afa1b00023bf5f91","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1266093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Lehman","original_name":"Boris Lehman","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/1CElhTCznn4EcV5rBJoPMixCoqA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee5fc55afa1b00023bf5fd3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2678289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Wald","original_name":"Jeremy Wald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee5fc6397eab4001ee6c6f7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzy Falk","original_name":"Suzy Falk","popularity":0.1036,"profile_path":"/uxwdyy1pxpQE1COvatWoHWEERU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee5fc7a97eab4001fe51022","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":130920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Micha Wald","original_name":"Micha Wald","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee5fc91afa1b00023bf600d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1398485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samy Szlingerbaum","original_name":"Samy Szlingerbaum","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"548c34cc92514122fc001752","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1520925,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marilyn Watelet","original_name":"Marilyn Watelet","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/gmsbxwFQJD83DT4fz6Wje4dKLGN.jpg","credit_id":"5ee5fcc9a217c00020d1a5a2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1398485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samy Szlingerbaum","original_name":"Samy Szlingerbaum","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee5fcb10cb3350021bd5cb3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1936515,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eva Houdova","original_name":"Eva Houdova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee5fcf2cb71b8001eb54232","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1959621,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michel Houssiau","original_name":"Michel Houssiau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee5fcdda217c00022d3ec15","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0212832","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"yi","file_path":"/4x7LELLV6eY2URKAOvHrPFETK4R.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zpBOhAm1DtTEwWr88207NHwJGEU.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Jewish Film Festival, Moscow","release_date":"1990-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
