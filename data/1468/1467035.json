Making their return to Indio, after playing Coachella in 2004 and 2008, the four performing members of Kraftwerk stood on elevated platforms, their gear glowing in neon colors to match the dazzling visual display board behind them. They played songs from throughout their discography, ranging from early favorites like \"Autobahn\" and \"Computer Love\" to ’90s singles \"Radioactivity\" and \"The Robots\". The set closed out with a medley of \"Musique Non-Stop\" and \"Boing Boom Tschak\".","popularity":0.0764,"poster_path":"/voDXLONK1YGDwdp9bIh3PzHvdBY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kraftwerk - Coachella 2025","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralf Hütter","original_name":"Ralf Hütter","popularity":0.1789,"profile_path":"/2XWPKufs2jHqJamUpnc9AS87nXJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68038127e03207d0b1d95a15","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Falk Grieffenhagen","original_name":"Falk Grieffenhagen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/tq1HPtguPfWAKIg8LygXE3vEKw2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"680381385570cba9e1ad1915","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henning Schmitz","original_name":"Henning Schmitz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qvsH6h6Wxw6n1cB8BHLbs7VJyvy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6803814ae03207d0b1d95a34","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5385694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Bongartz","original_name":"Georg Bongartz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68062c0f3f88854c49ee6035","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/m8W702R6Zf5q3dWLxfAn1AeTNPp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/voDXLONK1YGDwdp9bIh3PzHvdBY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Coachella Weekend 1","release_date":"2025-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
