In 2007, a young David forms a sweet summer camp bond with Janelle, saving mementos from their camp days together in his memory box. As the years pass, David experiences first love with his high school sweetheart, Amy, and eventually navigates heartbreak and the complexities of adult relationships with Mia. Throughout, David adds to his memory box, collecting tokens from his past — symbols of how love, although fickle, will always find a way back into his life again.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Were","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4426687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Romano","original_name":"Kevin Romano","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"David","credit_id":"68056e4f3f88854c49ee3c24","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5384804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damian Shillis","original_name":"Damian Shillis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Young David","credit_id":"68057000e3fac2f90289f303","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5384805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivienne Cvetkovski","original_name":"Vivienne Cvetkovski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Janelle","credit_id":"6805702ae3fac2f90289f315","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5384806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Thamage","original_name":"Amanda Thamage","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Amy","credit_id":"6805704a03344aee7089ec0b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2542708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonah Haber","original_name":"Jonah Haber","popularity":0.1487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68056d8dc3e8e74b6dee30d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2542708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonah Haber","original_name":"Jonah Haber","popularity":0.1487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68057138276bf64e41aaa7fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5384814,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Saro Acharya","original_name":"Saro Acharya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6805715e276bf64e41aaa80c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2525843,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Diego Guijarro","original_name":"Diego Guijarro","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6805719f3f88854c49ee3d11","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5384816,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarah Brannan","original_name":"Sarah Brannan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680571fd3f88854c49ee3d6f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4382265,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Renzo Sunga","original_name":"Renzo Sunga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68057256421a30975caaa155","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2376486,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Ren","original_name":"Michael Ren","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68057280b659822812ee32de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2608055,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Barker","original_name":"Michael Barker","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680572bc37a722b88689f678","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3530033,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Stephanie Sakaki","original_name":"Stephanie Sakaki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6805730737a722b88689f689","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
