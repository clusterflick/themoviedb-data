Twenty three fishing trawlers leave Israel’s ports every day, and many fish ponds operate inland, but some fishermen still use primitive fishing methods. To increase the total quantity of fish farmed and caught in Israel, the Ministry of Agriculture researches fishing methods and trains new fishermen. The film’s camera moves from the Fisheries Research Institute’s labs in Haifa to the classrooms of the fishing school in Mikhmoret, sails aboard the trawler Nakdimon, and eventually returns to the canning factories and fish markets in Israel.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":64937,"logo_path":null,"name":"Israel Film Service","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1956-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fishing in Israel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natan Gross","original_name":"Natan Gross","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6803d0342368b12b17995981","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3988883,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nissim Leon","original_name":"ניסים לאון","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6803d05361b1c4bb329a6a60","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3136013,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Haim Hefer","original_name":"Haim Hefer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6803d23de3fac2f90289aa3b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"1956-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
