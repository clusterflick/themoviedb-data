Matt Nelsen directs “Seven Rings,” a perfectly awkward romantic comedy about the sad life of a gregarious man. Looking to move on from a string of failed romances, Jerry Pound tries to convince himself he’s ready to sell his engagement rings. That’s when he runs into Julie, an old girlfriend from high school, and attempts to rekindle their past chemistry. On an impromptu walk through the city, they chat about dreams, upcoming travel plans (“to the moon?”), and current jobs (she works in canned produce). It’s an endearing jaunt into the head of a mustached man giving pure 1980’s divorced dad vibes, hilariously performed by Brad Howe and NoBudge favorite, Kelly Cooper. -KA. Written and directed by Matt Nelsen. Produced by Brad Howe and Matt Nelsen. Starring Brad Howe and Kelly Cooper. Featuring Devin Bockrath, Andy Mills, Caroline Schaper, and Kelsey Bailey.
