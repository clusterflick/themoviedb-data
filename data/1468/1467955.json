But the centuries of boat building tradition behind their wooden punts are in danger. Modern materials and the retreating number of old school builders are threatening the very survival of the humble wooden punt. The teams are not just in a race of endurance - they are in a race against time; to save the wooden boat building tradition from disappearing from the islands forever.","popularity":0.0806,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":215765,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cranky Goat Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Fogo Island Punt Race","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2748062,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christopher Richardson","original_name":"Christopher Richardson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68057984421a30975caaa1be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2748062,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christopher Richardson","original_name":"Christopher Richardson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68057989e3fac2f90289f425","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2748062,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christopher Richardson","original_name":"Christopher Richardson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680579903f88854c49ee3e4c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2748062,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christopher Richardson","original_name":"Christopher Richardson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680579953f88854c49ee3e50","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4416570,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leo Bruce","original_name":"Leo Bruce","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6805799f421a30975caaa1c3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4416570,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leo Bruce","original_name":"Leo Bruce","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680579aa3f88854c49ee3e54","department":"Sound","job":"Location Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3748540,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jamie Lewis","original_name":"Jamie Lewis","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680579b203344aee7089ede6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5384812,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Chapman","original_name":"Daniel Chapman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680579ba3f88854c49ee3e5a","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5384860,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Desmond Adams","original_name":"Desmond Adams","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680579cc3f88854c49ee3e6b","department":"Crew","job":"Transportation Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5384861,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kevin Decker","original_name":"Kevin Decker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680579d76e1a769e81ee3779","department":"Crew","job":"Transportation Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5384862,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Keith Emberley","original_name":"Keith Emberley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680579dfac02d4407baaa542","department":"Crew","job":"Transportation Coordinator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1739242","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1422,"name":"boat"},{"id":40870,"name":"race"},{"id":171459,"name":"rowing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
