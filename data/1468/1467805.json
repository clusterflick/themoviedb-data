After four decades, they're still active. Old fans are joined by newer younger bands that tribute their music and rock 'n' roll attitude. The mixture of two eras joined by one music band are captured by Manuel González, who manages to stop time in Valparaíso to tell us the story of the iconic group, their adventures, anecdotes, legacy, and their will to stand still, before time does its thing and takes them away forever.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/qEsS08G7YbbzPXEUAZTYVxRLX0S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":259972,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kithano
