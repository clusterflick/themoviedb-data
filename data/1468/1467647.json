Projecting over 25,000 chronological images from art history (from cave painting to global contemporary art, including outsider and psychedelic art), THUTOAH echoes conceptually the actions of CERN's particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), accelerating at 25 images per second in a looped sequence. Alongside this colossal library of images is a soundtrack of interviews with scientists at CERN about the holographic principle and my Holographic Universe Theory of Art History.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Holographic Universe Theory Of Art History","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5383512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzanne Treister","original_name":"Suzanne Treister","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6804b72d276bf64e41aa7b59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
