Each character uses the screen to tell his own story. We see each character as he wishes us to see him. Each character tells us what to think about his two friends. But as the film progresses the aspect ratio changes and the film stops being a documentary controlled by the characters and becomes a birds-eye view into the lives of these three friends that is completely unfiltered. We see them as they truly are (the good, the bad, and everything else that they wish to hide). This film explores the psyche of Gen Zers and their relationship to the plethora of technology that rests at their fingertips.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ymPGQS73gdIekjOQyGcIJFlqYlA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"North by South Dakota","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5382627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Burr","original_name":"Tom Burr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"680408d95570cba9e1ad35f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5382628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Limoges","original_name":"John Limoges","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"John","credit_id":"680408ed5570cba9e1ad3606","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5382629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Brickweg","original_name":"John Brickweg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Johnnie","credit_id":"6804090637a722b88689aea1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5382631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Limoges","original_name":"Stephen Limoges","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Stephen","credit_id":"6804091203344aee7089aa8a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5382628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Limoges","original_name":"John Limoges","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6804092de3fac2f90289b878","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5382628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Limoges","original_name":"John Limoges","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6804093d61b1c4bb329a7985","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5382628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Limoges","original_name":"John Limoges","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6804094d65c23f254eacee6d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5382631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Limoges","original_name":"Stephen Limoges","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6804097265c23f254eacee7d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5382629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Brickweg","original_name":"John Brickweg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6804098cb13410cdc7995bfc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5382627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Burr","original_name":"Tom Burr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6804099a5570cba9e1ad3651","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5382628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Limoges","original_name":"John Limoges","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680409b661b1c4bb329a79b3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5382629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Brickweg","original_name":"John Brickweg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680409c603344aee7089ab29","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5382631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Limoges","original_name":"Stephen Limoges","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68040a0161b1c4bb329a79e7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5382628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Limoges","original_name":"John Limoges","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68040a1a03344aee7089ab70","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pZS7BFLeYHULC0DAhPaHBfD2LUs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2150,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rT4xmRsiYOKiPuLulHI9sCe7CLz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3822}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1703,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ymPGQS73gdIekjOQyGcIJFlqYlA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1135}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Black Hills Film Festival","release_date":"2021-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
