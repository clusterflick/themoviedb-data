Long, long ago, a lake called Yasha-ga-ike dried up. The village headman sacrificed his daughter to the dragon god who dwelt in the lake, and the rains returned to the village.... In the middle Meiji Period, Iyobe Kiyohiko, a student under the tutelage of the businessman Shimamura, is telling ghost stories with his friends when the tale of Yasha-ga-ike is told. Kiyohiko then sets out for the lake to put his courage to the test, when he encounters a girl being set upon by brigands.
