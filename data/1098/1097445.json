Though a series of motifs, an African American woman geologist is the catalyst that narrates Cleveland's prehistoric, past and present landscape. The title refers to Cleveland shale from the Devonian period (417 to 354 B.C.) a time that saw the arrival of many types of new fish. The irony lies in the story's subtle plot regarding murder/suicides in Cleveland, illustrated with archival footage of crime scenes.","popularity":0.0614,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Golden Age of Fish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2801513,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Carla Carter","original_name":"Carla Carter","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Assistant","credit_id":"640906bd17c443008131b7f0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3954877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Hunt","original_name":"Lisa Hunt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Maxine","credit_id":"640906cc0e441900f7d97aa2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3954878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Kelly","original_name":"Jason Kelly","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Make-up artist","credit_id":"640906da175051007c681ae2","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","original_name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/73HkNiQo15TBV7SysKt6ajFBbG6.jpg","credit_id":"6409069e9661fc0099fcd63d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","original_name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/73HkNiQo15TBV7SysKt6ajFBbG6.jpg","credit_id":"640906a6d75bd600a2d529d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1266651","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
