She re-speaks a text from In My Language, a video posted to YouTube in 2007 by autism activist and blogger Amanda Baggs, in which, using a speech-generation device, Baggs describes her experience as an individual who communicates nonverbally in a predominantly verbal world. Tsang recites Baggs’s address verbatim, using a technique she calls “Full Body Quotation,” in which she conceives of her own body as a mimetic “playback device” that replicates the tone, inflection, and rhythm of the original monologue as it plays through an unseen earpiece.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shape of a Right Statement","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1144951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wu Tsang","original_name":"Wu Tsang","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/7Pfn74TakjhNe87VOK0I91vpVbe.jpg","credit_id":"6408c9b953f83300d75f2f29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
