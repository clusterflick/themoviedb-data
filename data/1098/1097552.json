Through a surreal montage of haunting images from diverse sources, a sense of the obsessions, phobias, and diseases that constrict personal freedom is tellingly communicated. Dancer David Figueroa contributes his original and evocative movements to the mix. A soundtrack with poems by Emily Dickinson and Sharon Olds escorts the visual, and an interview with the filmmaker’s mother poignantly underscores the latter’s struggle with Parkinson’s disease.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1lRqGhBLBSAU2Oc0caUE9SZjxtR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Voluntary Control","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2385094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cathy Cook","original_name":"Cathy Cook","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6409461a271671007cc3ece0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":974,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1lRqGhBLBSAU2Oc0caUE9SZjxtR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":650}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
