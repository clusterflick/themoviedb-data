She is a beautiful and slightly spoiled heiress, the kind of woman for whom Italian silent cinema reserved unfortunate turns of fate in order to elevate her to the status of tragic heroine. Even the few minutes remaining make clear that she proposes her own reinterpretation of the genre’s themes and motifs: from astonished grief over her father’s death to desperate wanderings through dark and impoverished alleyways. It is an expressive palette around which Pasquali weaves his discreet direction, paying particular attention to lighting effects.","popularity":0.0865,"poster_path":"/mz519xGAWdMgkhwJ4yaMCrqguj7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1916-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Life, Beyond Death","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Au delà de la vie, au delà de la mort","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":544953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Karenne","original_name":"Diana Karenne","popularity":0.1655,"profile_path":"/77KHl3Cnvh6qXt895XhQUbFiaMq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6408e5c1d37197009ca40f20","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Capozzi","original_name":"Alberto Capozzi","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/zB9UAZebn9wqn8sfIaAQ5gqai4B.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6408e5d1d75bd6007c5096c2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1484162,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ernesto Maria Pasquali","original_name":"Ernesto Maria Pasquali","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6408e5efd75bd6007c5096cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Capozzi","original_name":"Alberto Capozzi","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/zB9UAZebn9wqn8sfIaAQ5gqai4B.jpg","credit_id":"6408e639cfe48f007a9b7886","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0407081","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mz519xGAWdMgkhwJ4yaMCrqguj7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1916-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
