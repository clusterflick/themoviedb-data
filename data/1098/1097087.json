But when the feeding pins were set up off south of the boarder about a decade ago, an unexpected thing happened. With nothing else to do but swim in a giant pin and get fed, these initial school sized bluefin began spawning. Broadcast spawners the fertile eggs drifted outside the pins and a “new” school of baby bluefin tuna were created. With perfect water conditions and a plentiful supply of bait, these fish stayed around and year after year continued to grow and breed and before anyone really knew what was happening, we had a bluefin tuna fishery in our back yard. Initially 20 to 25-pound fish were being caught. Each consecutive year producing larger fish. This year we’re anticipating setting a new California state record when a 400-pound local fish will be captured.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/t9L3fOySHKeMmr22Cq3FpVtbPlb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195234,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inside Sportfishing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reeling in the Dreams: Southern California Bluefin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3160413,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Fowlkes","original_name":"Michael Fowlkes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Host","credit_id":"640879e05e120000e7777a01","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3160413,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Fowlkes","original_name":"Michael Fowlkes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640879e95e1200007bdeab88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t9L3fOySHKeMmr22Cq3FpVtbPlb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
