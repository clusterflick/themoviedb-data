Developers are converting empty lots and unused old buildings into new housing stocks for international students rather than the locals. Through an empathetic and personal documentary lens, Chan befriends 91-year-old Harry, a long-time resident and community councillor, and follows a group of grassroots housing advocates in order to understand the clash and todayâ€™s global housing crisis.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ez3GACWlA5LiusJzuHfq6WACxsi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dispute","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ez3GACWlA5LiusJzuHfq6WACxsi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
