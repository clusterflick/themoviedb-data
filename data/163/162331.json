He then discovers a piano that washed ashore, and begins playing it. The animals come around; a gorilla, after playing a 4-hands piece with his feet, destroys the piano. Mickey runs away and accidentally wakes a lion. The lion chases Mickey to a stream, where he jumps onto a rock that turns out to be right next to a crocodile.","popularity":0.2115,"poster_path":"/3HkmaTSBlYJA228HTUeKYJP6lqe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1931-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Castaway","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":28,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El naufragio de Mickey","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mickey Mouse (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f7890a98741c40037708f36","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wilfred Jackson","original_name":"Wilfred Jackson","popularity":0.3723,"profile_path":"/rTszyDc1jFOQQrzSYgnxEVLxd8W.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c58c3a36847f82298b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":225708,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Rudy Zamora Jr.","original_name":"Rudy Zamora Jr.","popularity":0.0432,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e74ffbc3a3681fec0011e3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148148,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Johnny Cannon","original_name":"Johnny Cannon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e75006c3a3682003000fb0","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115754,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Les Clark","original_name":"Les Clark","popularity":0.2036,"profile_path":"/3MBRk8Nm3m5FG8hcVCXKWzGhnJS.jpg","credit_id":"54e74f4fc3a3685af7001ad3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225709,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Frenchy de Trémaudan","original_name":"Frenchy de Trémaudan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54e7501392514110f6001077","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"5f7890e143cd5400354be840","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":171837,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Sutherland","original_name":"John Sutherland","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7890f6021cee003632f8bc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0021718","wikidata_id":"Q3203320","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hg853rNiL5Zgq0c1HAj01cR6YCZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3HkmaTSBlYJA228HTUeKYJP6lqe.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uvEjqk1lXDUstu6v9g8c0JfaAxQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/uFQlhTmYtzVL27tLWGcUlPhzUbg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1931-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
