The King buys his daily newspaper. Bertil searches the parking lot for dogs to photograph. Hans and Gun-Britt is planting a big, but still too small rock in their garden. Trying to get their minds off it all. As darkness falls over the little village in the woods, the Indians gather for a meeting in the town house as angst, frustration and silent prayer echoes in the night. With visual precision and attention to detail, director Mikel Cee Karlsson captures people and their existence in a small village deep inside the Swedish forest. Over a period of four years, the music video director and former professional skateboarder Mikel has been capturing singular scenes from a part of today’s Sweden where reality inexorably seeps in behind the colourful fasad. With a mixture of playful precision, humour and melancholy he portrays people’s dreams, their relationships and everyday destinies.","popularity":0.1379,"poster_path":"/xYVV3QP7rsRI7G94PI2HxK0ePbp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2009-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greetings from the Woods","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikel Cee Karlsson","original_name":"Mikel Cee Karlsson","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c61c3a36847f822b525","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikel Cee Karlsson","original_name":"Mikel Cee Karlsson","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661c3191ce9e91014a7c5e97","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932556,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erik Hemmendorff","original_name":"Erik Hemmendorff","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46d8b28efe730034bccdd5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikel Cee Karlsson","original_name":"Mikel Cee Karlsson","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46d8f1a2e6020035f0ddcc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2756129,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Peter Carlsson","original_name":"Peter Carlsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46d928f6596f0036ab00f7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1746309,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hans Appelqvist","original_name":"Hans Appelqvist","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46d942f6596f0035aab42a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikel Cee Karlsson","original_name":"Mikel Cee Karlsson","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46d954d0b4340035184cb4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruben Östlund","original_name":"Ruben Östlund","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":"/o4SdiMI5CyF1BrYL9aUhRQl58Xw.jpg","credit_id":"5f46d9ada8b2ca003888a38d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1332141,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Owe Svensson","original_name":"Owe Svensson","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/neULjCUlVnHv6roP5crOQdvDNHJ.jpg","credit_id":"5f46d9d98efe730035bbb405","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1024186,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Alvermark","original_name":"Jan Alvermark","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46da048cfcc70035482486","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1288642","wikidata_id":"Q18290796","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5GAy9Y2RmCrLzIIx9ZqIapW7f2Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2893,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xYVV3QP7rsRI7G94PI2HxK0ePbp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1929}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
