Concerts took place at Wembley Stadium in London, Giants Stadium in New Jersey and the Palais des Nations in Geneva. The Wembley show was at capacity; the U.S. show suffered from very poor ticket sales. The concert was considered a flop by many observers, failing to raise nearly as much cash as Live Aid.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Net Aid","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
