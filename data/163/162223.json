This cartoon aimed to answer that all-important question between two of Warner Brothers' speediest characters. Of course, the race (set in an American desert) wouldn't be interesting without Wile E. Coyote or Sylvester trying to nab the bird and mouse. Both the hard-luck coyote and the puddy tat use a variety of tactics to grap their respective dinners, all which (of course) fail. In the end, Wile E. and Sylvester use a supersonic jet to pass their prey at the finish line (and \"win\" the race), but their vehicle quickly careens over the cliff. The poor puddy tat fall down over the cliff, just like Wile E. has so many times.","popularity":0.739,"poster_path":"/oy6v5gB5Orrsb9WyvjEDRhf0ZWj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8402,"logo_path":null,"name":"DePatie-Freleng Enterprises","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1965-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wild Chase","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La carrera loca","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"A nagy vesszőfutás","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Speedy Gonzales / Sylvester / Race Announcer / Starter (voice)","credit_id":"52fe4c57c3a36847f82293d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":573544,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Paul Julian","original_name":"Paul Julian","popularity":0.2465,"profile_path":"/twa68PDAF7DcBYM8Vo6QRzC4Cg8.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Road Runner (voice)","credit_id":"52fe4c57c3a36847f82293d9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Friz Freleng","original_name":"Friz Freleng","popularity":0.3307,"profile_path":"/v7CtAOi4eLJkyu9bZN1yC8e5Wco.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c56c3a36847f8229383","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113180,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Warren Batchelder","original_name":"Warren Batchelder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c56c3a36847f82293ad","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142729,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Tom O'Loughlin","original_name":"Tom O'Loughlin","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c56c3a36847f82293bf","department":"Art","job":"Background Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Friz Freleng","original_name":"Friz Freleng","popularity":0.3307,"profile_path":"/v7CtAOi4eLJkyu9bZN1yC8e5Wco.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c56c3a36847f8229395","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30681,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"William Lava","original_name":"William Lava","popularity":0.2392,"profile_path":"/bj6jr8LoKuPgN5YxIRJDhZjvVp0.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c56c3a36847f822939b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088275,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lee Gunther","original_name":"Lee Gunther","popularity":0.0788,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c56c3a36847f82293a1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79232,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Burton Jr.","original_name":"John Burton Jr.","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c56c3a36847f82293a7","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":573776,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Manuel Perez","original_name":"Manuel Perez","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c56c3a36847f82293c5","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932733,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Laverne Harding","original_name":"Laverne Harding","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c56c3a36847f82293b3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121216,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Hawley Pratt","original_name":"Hawley Pratt","popularity":0.3637,"profile_path":"/eWILFLR1cCUbstcHk8pIJibpmn5.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c56c3a36847f8229389","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34732,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David H.
