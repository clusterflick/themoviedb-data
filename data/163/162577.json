When Minnie is captured by a bird's song, Mickey hides in his bird-house and pretends to be a bird himself, until a cat attacks and blows his cover. Then he does a dance while wearing the house; their song attracts more birds, and again the cat. Pluto chases, but he's still pulling the lawnmower, and it causes much destruction.","popularity":0.2818,"poster_path":"/9cyOHHpukK3SQ9S1BiybUOluafw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1931-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mickey Cuts Up","video":false,"vote_average":5.652,"vote_count":33,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Topolino giardiniere","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":232415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcellite Garner","original_name":"Marcellite Garner","popularity":0.1616,"profile_path":"/wnR43U3x7gVV3PM3BAZ7Kr7HQ4h.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Minnie Mouse (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"56086e76c3a368120d005dfe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mickey Mouse (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"62811b75cee481006663dafc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pinto Colvig","original_name":"Pinto Colvig","popularity":0.3687,"profile_path":"/jslBLHuV1cOKsyx763CA1RqsrQU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pluto (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"62811b87caa50850dbc62274","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Burt Gillett","original_name":"Burt Gillett","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/wCMnwuzTVyheJ9mGgHVhbdm2XFY.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c5bc3a36847f822a0a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"679e61a41742b44a14cb49ba","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0022145","wikidata_id":"Q761580","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3w1XGik2qM55HLFuH4muSIrLIWM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9cyOHHpukK3SQ9S1BiybUOluafw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qozz1nBh79wlWgzeHV1zOZPQzUL.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/x7UourOTTB9KZKnWBkzg7xHcjPu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/fyAz2KQ69ezCPfH2ctsYla43XPX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1931-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
