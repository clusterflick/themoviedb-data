The film is an entirely silent montage of documentary footage, ragged experimental techniques — mainly some negative-image inserts — and symbolic psychodrama that's surprisingly not too different from the work that Stan Brakhage would begin making just a year or two later. Images of death proliferate throughout the film, and what started as a loose documentary soon becomes an eerie psuedo-horror piece that's obsessed with death and decay.","popularity":0.0687,"poster_path":"/w3wf6vHudTGY4Qy9hlQMqATqMJJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1951-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Isabelle aux Dombes","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Dombes","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1722819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulette Malan","original_name":"Paulette Malan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"58524db9c3a3682f5801f8d4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurice Pialat","original_name":"Maurice Pialat","popularity":0.1881,"profile_path":"/qmdCLKHQgUMXla3mXUYPXvNKfac.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c58c3a36847f822987f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1861353","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/w3wf6vHudTGY4Qy9hlQMqATqMJJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/c6qroK4MQ7Akck1UtVcK15GLThY.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
