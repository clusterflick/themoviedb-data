Later, upon arrival of director George Marshall, Louise is sent off \"to practice\" alone while the cast and crew go about shooting the film.","popularity":0.2842,"poster_path":"/2eDwLPhC9ScHs5rtex8BDYmrrJh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/zhD3hhtKB5qyv7ZeL4uLpNxgMVU.png","name":"Warner Bros.
