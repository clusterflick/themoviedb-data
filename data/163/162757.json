Moving with astonishing assurance through time and space, Russell recreates his life in a series of interconnected episodes – his thirties childhood in Southampton, his first sexual experience (watching Disney’s Pinocchio), his schooldays at the Nautical College, Pangbourne, early careers in the Merchant Marine and the Royal Air Force, dancing days at the Shepherds Bush Ballet Club and of course his career as a film-maker, beginning with an extraordinary interview with Huw Weldon for a job on Monitor.  Full of marvellously funny anecdotes and fascinating insights into the realities of the film director's life, A British Picture is a remarkable autobiography.","popularity":0.0804,"poster_path":"/dhO2vBiC7uJ4xpP6EQM1fhMebTt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6197,"logo_path":"/6LFn6YTFLtqNFkWw85csFErB2dv.png","name":"LWT","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1989-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Portrait of an Enfant Terrible","title":"A British Picture","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32327,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Russell","original_name":"Ken Russell","popularity":0.3562,"profile_path":"/hM5kaWhCsdZbl2NsHES3rWzt8xa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5b817cc6c3a368654e01197b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":931354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Molly Russell","original_name":"Molly Russell","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b817cd692514159dd012d67","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1809070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rupert Russell","original_name":"Rupert Russell","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b817cedc3a3686560012200","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32265,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Victoria Russell","original_name":"Victoria Russell","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b817d0892514159e0013929","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231891,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vivian Russell","original_name":"Vivian Russell","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b817d170e0a26459c0118e6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32327,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Russell","original_name":"Ken Russell","popularity":0.3562,"profile_path":"/hM5kaWhCsdZbl2NsHES3rWzt8xa.jpg","credit_id":"5799cfc2c3a36821d300191b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58660,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dick Bush","original_name":"Dick Bush","popularity":0.0632,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66917d692263da7cccace80d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32327,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Russell","original_name":"Ken Russell","popularity":0.3562,"profile_path":"/hM5kaWhCsdZbl2NsHES3rWzt8xa.jpg","credit_id":"5b817d3092514159dd012ddb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32265,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Victoria Russell","original_name":"Victoria Russell","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b817d5dc3a3686560012257","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0096982","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1586,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dhO2vBiC7uJ4xpP6EQM1fhMebTt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1057}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1989-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
