He soon finds out that there is a mystery behind Nandini and her presence in his house, apart from the fact that she is mentally imbalanced. When he probes further, he finds that she is claiming to be his illegitimate daughter. He does accept her and decides to let her live there, but his wife, his son, his sister, his son-in-law, and daughter have other plans - for they have hired notorious hit-man Samar Khan to abduct and kill Nandini at any cost.
