In this grueling race the teams of 2 have to overcome their physical and even more mental barriers and in doing so experience the full range of emotions. From excitement and confidence at the start over lurking self-doubt and distressing fear of failure, to pure bliss, relief and joyfulness when finally crossing the finish line of the last stage.  The Transalpine Run is the most beautiful mountain stage race in the world. Every year 300+ teams register to enjoy the breathtaking beauty of the alps, an outstandingly hearty community of runners and the lovely care of dozens of helpers and organizers. With „Beyond the doubt“ filmmaker Stephan Wieser digs deep into the scene of the 2019 edition by capturing stunning outdoor images, in-depth athlete interviews and true emotions.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BEYOND THE DOUBT - The Transalpine Run","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2925160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephan Wieser","original_name":"Stephan Wieser","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/8z7Vz2dy3hb4NH6uADmcPr45eCT.jpg","credit_id":"644f052023a31403147b4461","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
