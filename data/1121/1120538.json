It’s a battle fought high in the Andes cordillera where farmers and local representatives fear the ravages of open pit mining operations in a place where a fragile system of glaciers feeds the rivers that flow into the farmlands built out of the advancing Atacama desert.","popularity":0.2444,"poster_path":"/wCVUaf8AqlCb4Gvm5fg0ood4ewo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20496,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions Multi-Monde","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mirage of El Dorado","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El Dorado, la sed de oro","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Mirage of El Dorado","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2016466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Frigon","original_name":"Martin Frigon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644fe1c652dc7f02dddb4dd3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2016466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Frigon","original_name":"Martin Frigon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644fe1cb23a31419c27b4299","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1918955","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wCVUaf8AqlCb4Gvm5fg0ood4ewo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6015,"name":"mining"},{"id":237176,"name":"chili"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
