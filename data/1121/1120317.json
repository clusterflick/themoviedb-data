From captaining a yacht to riding It’s a Small World, making friends with a dolphin and a deer, even peeing on the world’s tallest trees, Abby does it all!

And incredibly, the Universe intervenes; Abby starts aging in reverse, and their three-week bucket list trip morphs into the three-year journey of their lives!","popularity":0.6189,"poster_path":"/hyJvd3g7SoxToBwec8nwh3A0hlf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Abby’s List: a Dogumentary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5278358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Cole","original_name":"Sophie Cole","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67c4156304b6b222cf4e12a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Farmer","original_name":"Bill Farmer","popularity":0.8522,"profile_path":"/lhezx68R12s5Bsv7d77BrQb7tWA.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67c41575a5e1e358c44b0ac2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1218613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Hanna","original_name":"Jack Hanna","popularity":0.2655,"profile_path":"/sjVp3Ov3567qNdFajXxBFFUZJ5y.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67c415b804b6b222cf4e12e7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5278361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abby Sutherland","original_name":"Abby Sutherland","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67c415d9ab4da0b0d5b491c1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5278335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Sutherland","original_name":"Mark Sutherland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67c415e5111cdd4ed8b4995a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1404216,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael A.
