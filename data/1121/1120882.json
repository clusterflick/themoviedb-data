The film, done mainly on black-and-white, but with color inserts, tells out the masters of folk crafts of the Hutsul region. The film is dedicated \"To the memory of Lev Dolynskyi and Danylo Fihol - my childhood friends.\" In the credits of the film it is clearly indicated that the author of the film is Yulian Dorosh and the film was shot in Kosiv region and Lviv in 1965-1971. There is no sound track on film stock.  Documentary was rediscovered in March 2020. Since no later films of Yulian Dorosh have been found, there is every reason to believe that this film was the last in his cinematic career.","popularity":0.0677,"poster_path":"/tYOJAgm6DEmoGjpTVMplmwvshJE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Near the Sources of Folk Art.
