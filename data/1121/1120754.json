Kuya Noel uses an inverter machine and rod in electric fishing. He comes along daily with his brother, but they often separate ways and gather more (Fish, Eel, and frogs). The documentary will show his everyday life in their home with his family, how they do “pangunguryente,” and how they sustain and survive just doing “pangunguryente” to earn their  living, knowing that not all the time  there is always plenty catch and  sometimes none, knowing that this kind of activity is illegal.","popularity":0.0841,"poster_path":"/5A6ZPWuN1OO5cK6nRnErn3TcDJH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199118,"logo_path":null,"name":"Project 55","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2023-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lusong","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4039896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noel Nazareno","original_name":"Noel Nazareno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"645066f393bd6900e5fe19da","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4039898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nolz Sanders Dela Cruz","original_name":"Nolz Sanders Dela Cruz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645068502a09bc0106f169ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4039903,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mencie Dela Cruz","original_name":"Mencie Dela Cruz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645068c2e942ee0104eee09f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4039906,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nolz Sanders Dela Cruz","original_name":"Nolz Sanders Dela Cruz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645068dc93bd6900e5fe1b4f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4039909,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nolz Sanders Dela Cruz","original_name":"Nolz Sanders Dela Cruz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645068fe93bd6901539229cb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4039905,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Manolito Dela Cruz","original_name":"Manolito Dela Cruz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645068ceaf85de015be649e8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4039908,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nolz Sanders Dela Cruz","original_name":"Nolz Sanders Dela Cruz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645068f22a09bc015d340106","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4039899,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nolz Sanders Dela Cruz","original_name":"Nolz Sanders Dela Cruz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6450685be16e5a015db40214","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4039907,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nolz Sanders Dela Cruz","original_name":"Nolz Sanders Dela Cruz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645068e793bd6901539229b0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5A6ZPWuN1OO5cK6nRnErn3TcDJH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
