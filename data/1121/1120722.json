The General Accounting Office estimated that bogus tax shelters at the time cost the government more than $85 billion.  Correspondent Hedrick Smith spoke with government officials, tax experts and industry insiders to expose these tax shelters. His reporting led him to some unexpected places — from the city of Dortmund, Germany, to the Cayman Islands. The documentary examined how difficult it was for the Internal Revenue Service to find tax shelters and how the tax shelter wave prompted a federal investigation. The ultimate victim in this scheme, experts in the documentary said, is the honest taxpayer who is left to make up what companies aren’t paying.","popularity":0.3716,"poster_path":"/gmX71lTe2LL8QO3cfxL1t0Vs2LG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hedrick Smith Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tax Me If You Can","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hedrick Smith","original_name":"Hedrick Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64504cd42a09bc015d33e8ba","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hedrick Smith","original_name":"Hedrick Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64504cf0e942ee00e5e42e8b","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hedrick Smith","original_name":"Hedrick Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64504d05e942ee00e5e42e9b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42037,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rick Young","original_name":"Rick Young","popularity":0.1398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64504d27435011015e91dfcf","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2325614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Young","original_name":"Rick Young","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64504d30af85de01213f1a83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2325614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Young","original_name":"Rick Young","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64504d382a09bc00e900882f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0877091","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gmX71lTe2LL8QO3cfxL1t0Vs2LG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6128,"name":"taxes"},{"id":14737,"name":"economics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
