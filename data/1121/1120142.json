With him are his friend, the Scotsman James Boswell, and his black servant Francis Barber. Staying with a series of hosts, including elderly Jacobite heroine Flora McDonald, Johnson and Boswell encounter traditional Scottish hospitality at first-hand, all the time arguing about politics (and in Boswell's case losing his head over every pretty woman he meets). Meanwhile, Francis and another black servant they encounter provide evidence of the new consciousness emerging in Britain's soon-to-be-independent American colonies.","popularity":1.1457,"poster_path":"/7YHLa1i2YHEhM6qau4OHBAdoUjS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boswell and Johnson's Tour of the Western Isles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robbie Coltrane","original_name":"Robbie Coltrane","popularity":1.1069,"profile_path":"/jOHs3xvlwRiiG2CLtso5zzmGCXg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr Samuel Johnson","credit_id":"644ec6abeea34d03093da4fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Sessions","original_name":"John Sessions","popularity":0.4735,"profile_path":"/8bN5H7T9XtOMijCwGndaMVCQ2sI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"James Boswell","credit_id":"644ec6bf955c6502e7366e1b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Celia Imrie","original_name":"Celia Imrie","popularity":1.2204,"profile_path":"/eEtVfESOVnkkdPLYkyQpalEwAwj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lady MacDonald","credit_id":"644ec6d3c92c5d02e5036e6e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1712823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth McGhie","original_name":"Ruth McGhie","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/jIZS0bMvuQ8SHF0YYSECC1yIaYT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Flora McDonald","credit_id":"644ec6f9031deb0300903e9e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":568385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Penelope McGhie","original_name":"Penelope McGhie","popularity":0.1021,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Miss Campbell","credit_id":"644ec73afea6e302f69f77a4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4037254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicola Esson","original_name":"Nicola Esson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Elizabeth McQuarrie","credit_id":"644ec76beea34d02dd3dab94","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1243037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Anstee","original_name":"Mark Anstee","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Captain MacLeod","credit_id":"644ec78763a695031efeda58","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan David","original_name":"Alan David","popularity":0.2268,"profile_path":"/qfwsmtVvspED68oRjzfuDcDIfSy.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Sir Aeneas MacPherson","credit_id":"644ec7c0fea6e302e69f79b5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Dury","original_name":"Ian Dury","popularity":0.2888,"profile_path":"/97ggi8jy6O5RDaDtULkOl1YTXoP.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Dr Reid","credit_id":"644ec7d5955c6502e7366e8e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Halfpenny","original_name":"Tony Halfpenny","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Coll","credit_id":"644ec7ebaf3da602e529f8c7","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald MacNeill","original_name":"Donald MacNeill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"McLeod of Raasay","credit_id":"644ec82163a6950303fedeff","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":133498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol MacReady","original_name":"Carol MacReady","popularity":0.2473,"profile_path":"/fF7YHP84ENGqWLZB2a5CvDul2VP.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Lady MacPherson","credit_id":"644ec83e955c6502e7366eb8","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard D.
