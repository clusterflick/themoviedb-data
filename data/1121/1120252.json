The video incorporates four layers of sonic compositions: arranged and digitally remixed voice narration over the original VHS tape audio, with a base layer of found “flute beat box” music. In this piece, time shifts away from the 1979 dreamlike film footage into the glitch and hot pink video revolution of 1985. Here, the constructions of indigenous memory is one that is split between times; one that fast forwards and rewinds and that stops to dance. The era and the memories in both films are felt through movement, colors and sound.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1KasM6GfCr6rvoABjUcIWaBy4Yz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blood (and) Memory2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4037511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcella Kwe","original_name":"Marcella Kwe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644f0578c0a30802dd6fd655","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":930,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1KasM6GfCr6rvoABjUcIWaBy4Yz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":620}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Native FilmFest in Cathedral City, California","release_date":"2019-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
