I mean what could be more fun than canceling Jim's birthday party, only to invite their friends round to surprise him? Imagine the look on his face! Priceless. Now he just has to divert Jim home. He hushes the party, puts the phone on loudspeaker and starts to lie through his teeth. The guests are loving it, squirming with stifled giggles and anticipation. But Jim doesn't really mind, he's not fussed for a party...well not with that lot anyway. What's he on about, they're all mates aren't they? But with friends like Jim, who needs friends?","popularity":0.2702,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Birthday Jim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Bennett","original_name":"Tom Bennett","popularity":0.3422,"profile_path":"/4OdiLc6nFrTr7rSVxdKeMvfLF56.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6451111ad7107e010adf105d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2114381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Copeland","original_name":"Daniel Copeland","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64511141af85de013e6463f6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3456592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Crowhurst","original_name":"Laura Crowhurst","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Emma","credit_id":"64511163e942ee0e38bd75c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Edgerley","original_name":"Chris Edgerley","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"64511194e16e5a01402018bb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2113758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Houlihan","original_name":"Matt Houlihan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/teiNkdxkexmDbqmXctmX7nFnIwq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Pete","credit_id":"645111d1e16e5a015db471b6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Lance","original_name":"James Lance","popularity":0.6014,"profile_path":"/xlcpKyVjwRR7RLrviI7Olo5S6FM.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jim","credit_id":"645111dfaf85de015be6b09d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4040742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyra Williams","original_name":"Kyra Williams","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sally","credit_id":"64511212af85de013e646479","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4040747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neal Wright","original_name":"Neal Wright","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"64511233af85de01213f9ba2","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4040759,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Allon Wechsler","original_name":"Allon Wechsler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64511348435011015e926488","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3195539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giles Ripley","original_name":"Giles Ripley","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6451129c43501100e4807b49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3195539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giles Ripley","original_name":"Giles Ripley","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645112afe942ee0e3a06a625","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2893672,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Gill","original_name":"Christian Gill","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6451131cd7107e00e3f01417","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2122347","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
