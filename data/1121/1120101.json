In the Croc Swamp Hideout, they are attacked by Worriz and Wilhurt on the Pack Tracker. Then Plovar´s Plane gets dragged down by Cragger´s Command Ship. G'Loona sees the bag and realizes why the Crocodile Tribe is chasing them. They get on some Bellow Plants and head to the Fangs, where they are attacked and almost fall into the Gorge of Eternal Depth. Laval then arrives on his Speedor and is trapped by rocks, but G'Loona throws him an orb of Chi and he rescues them as the Lion Tribe arrive and Lagravis takes the Chi back to the Lion Chi Temple. Skinnet then lets out his skunk fumes and everyone flees.","popularity":0.0597,"poster_path":"/ky7Ac2Z73Lljt9vytG9TtG6w7Xa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Legends of Chima 4D Movie Xperience","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sMcmuf6RvHqYU04A8yIt3L2UALH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ky7Ac2Z73Lljt9vytG9TtG6w7Xa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"LEGO® Legends of Chima 4D Movie at the LEGOLAND Windsor Resort","key":"4kuVI9ocxLs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-02-11T13:24:05.000Z","id":"644eb75aeea34d02f43da2e7"}]}}}
