Cocoon follows a frustrated young black dishwasher who visits adult bookstores and lives a lonely, meager existence. Filmed against a particularly sleazy (and hippie-filled) late-1960s Hollywood. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called Cocoon \"one of the finest serious short films ever made, right up there with Roman Polanski's Two Men and a Wardrobe.\"","popularity":0.0593,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cocoon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1443850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khosrow Haritash","original_name":"Khosrow Haritash","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/mRF5BMzWwDIdpYJx4RowgnakO3w.jpg","credit_id":"6450875d4350110107984485","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7053044","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
