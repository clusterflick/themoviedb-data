They are part of a 114-year-old Afrikaans Boer community - South Africans of Dutch descent who sailed across the ocean to South America after the destruction of a war with the British. Today, less than 50 still speak the language and they struggle to keep their culture alive. Patriarch \"Ty\" Dickason, 82, is a cowboy who has never flown in a plane - and yet he yearns to one day visit the country of his blood before he and his compatriots pass away. This multiple SAFTA award-winning documentary is a portrait of the last days of the community - a parallel world where Afrikaans was never linked to Apartheid - and one family's journey to reconnect with South Africa.","popularity":0.7251,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":85107,"logo_path":null,"name":"A GOOD Work","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2015-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In remote Patagonia, a 100-year-old community of Afrikaans Boers struggles to keep their language and culture alive, while longing to be reunited with their distant families in South Africa.","title":"The Boers at the End of the World","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732410,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Finn Gregory","original_name":"Richard Finn Gregory","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586c861d925141087e003712","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732415,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Eppel","original_name":"Daniel Eppel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586c869c925141086d003975","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732414,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rian Zietsman","original_name":"Rian Zietsman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586c867792514108780039e9","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732409,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kelly Scott","original_name":"Kelly Scott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586c860bc3a368037e0039c2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732411,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Richard Finn Gregory","original_name":"Richard Finn Gregory","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586c862c925141087c0037d7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732410,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Finn Gregory","original_name":"Richard Finn Gregory","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586c864b9251410872003bb3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732413,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Louis Nel","original_name":"Louis Nel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586c866b9251410872003bcb","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":50082,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ronelle Loots","original_name":"Ronelle Loots","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586c863dc3a368038f003c24","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4387516","wikidata_id":"Q116202673","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3644,"name":"south africa"},{"id":10257,"name":"afrikaans"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"af","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Boers at the End of the World - Teaser","key":"6h39nq0KqHs","published_at":"2014-02-17T06:17:49.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"586c887ec3a368037e003b45"}]}}}
