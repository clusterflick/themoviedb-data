Stefan has been born with severe asthma. Katharina has ceased to count the nights that she has spent at his bed listening with fear, his breath. Their care and care have accompanied the child's growing up. Very deeply in Katharina is a doubt whether she really loves her child. Stefan's burgeoning sexuality finds its way in a disturbing way. He scares women during nightly journeys through the city, escorts prostitutes in front of a brothel, and watches couples in sex. When a young woman is found dead, the suspicion grows in Katharina that Stefan can be the culprit. He winds more and more out of Katharina's clasp and is increasingly aggressively seeking his own space. When a second woman is found murdered, Catherine's suspicion becomes evident. The relationship between mother and son implies a tragedy.","popularity":0.3729,"poster_path":"/t0Viav1COaglMi0LEXDblyWz6M6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13587,"logo_path":"/e1xxYKGJ9WjnjvkAWDUwmwruuuG.png","name":"Ziegler
