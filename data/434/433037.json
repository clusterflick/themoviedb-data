She sleeps on a lawn-chair and surrounds herself with boxes stacked from floor to ceiling, filled with works of her art that have never seen the light of day. These boxes hide a stunning body of work -but it's come at a huge cost. Her life as a reclusive guardian over her creativity and artwork inspires us to think about the world that we have each chosen for ourselves, how we are captive of it or freed by it. During humorous, intimate and provocative moments, first-time Dutch director Corinne van der Borch develops a delicate friendship with Bettina and gradually unveils the life of one of New York's last true eccentrics.","popularity":0.0825,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2010-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girl With Black Balloons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bettina Grossman","original_name":"Bettina Grossman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"586bfbe9925141484c000208","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606428,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nyneve Laura Minnear","original_name":"Nyneve Laura Minnear","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586bfac5c3a36828460004ca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732151,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Corinne van der Borch","original_name":"Corinne van der Borch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586bfaa4925141484f000197","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732151,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Corinne van der Borch","original_name":"Corinne van der Borch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586bfa4fc3a3682854000474","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1688453","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Documentary: The Girl with Black Balloons","key":"19950148","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-02-14T22:32:24.000Z","id":"63127031e295b4007e996076"}]}}}
