Every summer, their piazza became their stage and residents of all ages played a part – the role of themselves. Monticchiello’s annual tradition has attracted worldwide attention and kept the town together for 50 years, but with an aging population and a future generation more interested in Facebook than farming, the town’s 50th–anniversary performance just might be its last. SPETTACOLO tells the story of Teatro Povero di Monticchiello, interweaving episodes from its past with its modern-day process as the villagers turn a series of devastating blows into a new play about the end of their world.","popularity":0.1908,"poster_path":"/cOjgsL6AiQhPhzCXvQag9OcHIhp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spettacolo","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1733326,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Shellen","original_name":"Chris Shellen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586e9eb7c3a3683b690094c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234397,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jeff Malmberg","original_name":"Jeff Malmberg","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/2WoTQksWcigqHZYjGNASFQys96R.jpg","credit_id":"586e9eaec3a3683b7100a35a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234397,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jeff Malmberg","original_name":"Jeff Malmberg","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/2WoTQksWcigqHZYjGNASFQys96R.jpg","credit_id":"58c3e712c3a3681a930032da","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":420499,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lele Marchitelli","original_name":"Lele Marchitelli","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c3e809925141341f002e44","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234397,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jeff Malmberg","original_name":"Jeff Malmberg","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/2WoTQksWcigqHZYjGNASFQys96R.jpg","credit_id":"58c3e717925141343e002f3d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1733326,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Shellen","original_name":"Chris Shellen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66071c650d417e017c053115","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6402212","wikidata_id":"Q48672701","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ullYe37j9QKRv0noJLFjy2ig55X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":755,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cOjgsL6AiQhPhzCXvQag9OcHIhp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":511}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"South by Southwest Film Festival","release_date":"2017-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
