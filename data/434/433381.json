Beaten but not defeated, the remnants of 1st Airborne Division fought a grim battle with the SS supported by reinforcements and armour rushed to Oosterbeek from all over the West. Veterans and experienced battlefield guides vividly relate their experiences and take the viewer to the scene of the action.  The seven days of grim and bloody fighting in the Oosterbeek Perimeter was amongst the hardest fought of all the battles in the West. It was one that the SS veterans of the Eastern Front in the Hohenstaufen Division christened the Hexenkessel or “Witches Cauldron”. All the while the the airborne soldiers were waiting for XXX Corps to arrive from the south, with the enemy pressing ever closer.","popularity":0.4519,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":72143,"logo_path":null,"name":"BHTV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Operation Market Garden: Arnhem - Battle for the Oosterbeek Perimeter","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"ARNHEM - BATTLE FOR THE OOSTERBEEK PERIMETER","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Operation Market Garden: Arnhem - Battle of the Oosterbeek Perimeter","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Hilton","original_name":"Bob Hilton","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"586e68df92514129560082c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1552505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Johnson","original_name":"Andy Johnson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"586e68f5c3a3683b710084d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1553249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Peters","original_name":"Mike Peters","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"586e690d92514129560082ee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1572893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jo Hook","original_name":"Jo Hook","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"586e6923c3a3683b7600839e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1552509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Hone","original_name":"Richard Hone","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"586e6946c3a3683b7e008d82","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1733182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Voskuil","original_name":"Robert Voskuil","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"586e69709251412956008327","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Saunders","original_name":"Tim Saunders","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"586e86e8c3a3683b690087e7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Duff","original_name":"Andrew Duff","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"586e86fcc3a3683b760093df","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Saunders","original_name":"Tim Saunders","popularity":0.1265,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586e69a292514129510085b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1550098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Duff","original_name":"Andrew Duff","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586e86a9925141296300970d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4100,"name":"british army"},{"id":7621,"name":"operation market garden"},{"id":193900,"name":"arnhem"},{"id":222687,"name":"german army"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
