A fierce ocean storm wrecks his ship and leaves him stranded by himself on an uncharted island. Left to fend for himself, Crusoe seeks out a tentative survival on the island, until he meets Friday, a tribesman whom he saves from being sacrificed. Initially, Crusoe is thrilled to finally have a friend, but he has to defend himself against the tribe who uses the island to sacrifice tribesman to their gods. During time their relationship changes from master-slave to a mutual respected friendship despite their difference in culture and religion.","popularity":2.3367,"poster_path":"/93uRPzVpf4ZVjDfswmpsrAmBS4w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14,"logo_path":"/m6AHu84oZQxvq7n1rsvMNJIAsMu.png","name":"Miramax","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-06-11","revenue":183886,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One survivor.
