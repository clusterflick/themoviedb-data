Rosa, a youth with wealthy parents, wants to establish herself as an artist. The clumsy and enthusiastic Viktor, not quite honest, wants work. When he wanders into Kaminsky's meeting with Opel and says something about irony, the Opel director wants him in on the campaign. Then he steals an idea from Rosa that the Opel director loves. Before Rosa discovers he's expropriated her idea, Rosa and Viktor become lovers. Father-son feelings materialize between Kaminsky and Viktor. Can the impulsive Viktor hold it together before Rosa learns the truth and flies away?","popularity":0.8903,"poster_path":"/sKM0GWn9khLiY7YEx9PXaJywXIc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2001-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Advertising Rules!","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Todo por el éxito","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Scheer","original_name":"Alexander Scheer","popularity":0.2534,"profile_path":"/a5pmIPM9lKh1YgGedCiV7zsWazc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Victor Vogel","credit_id":"52fe43ee9251416c7502376b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Götz George","original_name":"Götz George","popularity":0.4681,"profile_path":"/jGnP1ErwHBMobS0yltcpBrNKa2O.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Edward Kaminsky","credit_id":"52fe43ee9251416c7502376f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chulpan Khamatova","original_name":"Чулпан Хаматова","popularity":0.2744,"profile_path":"/97LVWafPRjyBHJLKdqBHN9dwmEF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rosa Braun","credit_id":"52fe43ee9251416c75023773","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Schrader","original_name":"Maria Schrader","popularity":0.2389,"profile_path":"/sZuIcKq5D75GNKlYecK08O3X0hG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Johanna von Schulenberg","credit_id":"52fe43ee9251416c75023777","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vadim Glowna","original_name":"Vadim Glowna","popularity":0.4448,"profile_path":"/zIWBd4kknAY292OJc99GN9q6vRd.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Werner Stahl","credit_id":"536aa763c3a3681241008911","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz-Werner Kraehkamp","original_name":"Heinz-Werner Kraehkamp","popularity":0.1554,"profile_path":"/prD76grQbWwVXpH9Utz9o5EXOjS.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Günter Pflüger","credit_id":"536aa776c3a36812310086de","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":557955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nele Mueller-Stöfen","original_name":"Nele Mueller-Stöfen","popularity":0.2241,"profile_path":"/4AHjf496OzpD5nnHn4z1bJs51P6.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Michelle","credit_id":"585c75d8c3a36840860016a6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guntram Brattia","original_name":"Guntram Brattia","popularity":0.1397,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Benjamin Schwarz","credit_id":"5c3bb452c3a368638a3c075f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gudrun Landgrebe","original_name":"Gudrun Landgrebe","popularity":0.3357,"profile_path":"/uAjvVyC5dEpvYn4fBN5tlKrePuU.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Mutter von Rosa","credit_id":"5c3bb4650e0a2654c18c6eee","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steffen Münster","original_name":"Steffen Münster","popularity":0.0857,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Till","credit_id":"62a4c57c05b5494d6d2aa37a","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Schmidt","original_name":"Andreas Schmidt","popularity":0.2017,"profile_path":"/2o5gt8z698s94p0mTccsLy6Djat.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Alfi","credit_id":"62a4c58ad5dbc20066a6f3ba","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Löw","original_name":"Hans Löw","popularity":0.2534,"profile_path":"/eu2VBm55a9aQNKEtFY9qKGm5ya5.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Boiler","credit_id":"62a4c5a3b87aec007174ccb6","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":180892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Lambroschini","original_name":"Julien Lambroschini","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/iqTVM32zOuOrrdAYEWCTa8FloWs.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Hackel","credit_id":"62a4c5b285005d2b16d0abc3","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Weiss","original_name":"Samuel Weiss","popularity":0.1564,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Anatole Lanzerac","credit_id":"62a4c5c87f6c8d360ccb07b1","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Schlootz","original_name":"Ellen Schlootz","popularity":0.0721,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Assistentin v.
