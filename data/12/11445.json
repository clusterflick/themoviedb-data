The film tells the story of the a couple of weeks in this family's life, beginning when a young Czech girl, Tash, comes to visit.  The film is made in the Dogme95 tradition, so no costumes, no lighting, no props or sets, which gives the film a gritty texture appropriate to the story.","popularity":1.0157,"poster_path":"/s3QgETONJh2qU9PaWCJFgAeM1O6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":4250,"logo_path":null,"name":"Molinare
