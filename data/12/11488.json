For JOHN EAVES, six-time winner of the Freestyle World Cup and stunt man for James Bond, it's love at first sight. For World Champion Freestyle skier SUZY CHAFFEE, it's a see-ya-later-buddy. But John doesn't give up easily. He decides that if the only way to win her means following her across country, then that's what he'll do. Starting in Manhattan he trudges 3,000 miles, through urban jungle and flatland desert, all the time fantasizing about what they'll do when they're together.  Spectacular filming of incredible ski stunts and snow dancing blend with a power-punching soundtrack to make FIRE AND ICE a movie packed with action and adventure. If you don't ski, you will!","popularity":0.2326,"poster_path":"/u7wcQX84OoQD1yvzsadZksxN7G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35937,"logo_path":null,"name":"Willy Bogner Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1986-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"FIRE: The passion between two people.
