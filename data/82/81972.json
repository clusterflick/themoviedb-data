Before heading off to college they spend one last day together in the woods, the one part of town that has always been off limits to them growing up. As they stumble upon what they thought was an abandoned fort only to find the walls dripping in blood and decompressing body parts lying around, they are startled to learn they are now a part of an undercover investigation. After being told to get out of the woods they realize they're trapped, for the Hunters, who call the fort home, never let anyone out alive.","popularity":1.2117,"poster_path":"/ue8zWUO7mtwv2x0J9vZW9ryBIba.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8471,"logo_path":"/rfmlWuH9lxt9pgQetWbNwZKSXvZ.png","name":"Tarantula","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":21595,"logo_path":null,"name":"HUMAL Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2011-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You are the prey!","title":"The Hunters","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":34,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Waddington","original_name":"Steven Waddington","popularity":0.488,"profile_path":"/gmlX5NNJI5HoNrK3RUPwBUmUgBW.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Ronny","credit_id":"52fe48359251416c910841f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":159091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Becker","original_name":"Tony Becker","popularity":0.1577,"profile_path":"/eM4ReW3D01LOCXlaNaBFtKD3hzw.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"Oliver Sheribow","credit_id":"52fe48359251416c910841fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dianna Agron","original_name":"Dianna Agron","popularity":1.0872,"profile_path":"/aN8mWrCE7zPMcYbP5pkxAke2B6M.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Alice","credit_id":"52fe48359251416c91084201","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terence Knox","original_name":"Terence Knox","popularity":0.5744,"profile_path":"/xo3naT9b3W0xF1sKj94FJtpv4e8.jpg","cast_id":1005,"character":"Bernard","credit_id":"52fe48359251416c91084205","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":574664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Brown","original_name":"Jay Brown","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/jnxDv12hMW5eqbq7e2vUEdnE0N.jpg","cast_id":1013,"character":"Stephen","credit_id":"57a92a3cc3a368733b00052a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Briant","original_name":"Chris Briant","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1007,"character":"Le Saint","credit_id":"52fe48359251416c9108420d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Briant","original_name":"Chris Briant","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48359251416c910841ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592783,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Lehman","original_name":"Michael Lehman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48359251416c910841f5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1133230,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas Malmonte","original_name":"Thomas Malmonte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534529b5c3a36825b10013f8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1018988,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Uli Simon","original_name":"Uli Simon","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53452a51c3a36825b1001405","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23580,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sharon Howard-Field","original_name":"Sharon Howard-Field","popularity":0.1299,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534529d0c3a36825890014c0","department":"Production","job":"Casting"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1308306,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John B.
