Though he'd rather breeze through life without responsibilities or obligations, Toni agrees to study zoology in college because his uncle (Hans Moser) wants him to. Alas, despite the Herculean efforts by Toni's servant Hassler (Theo Lingen) to prepare his master for his final exams, Toni forgets to show up for the finals and is expelled post-haste. In desperation, his uncle arranges for Toni to get married, and once again our hero just can't say no. Trouble is, he falls in love with trapeze artist Bianca (Gusti Huber), whose father won't let her marry anyone except another entertainer. Undaunted, Toni studies a book on show business and tries out for the vaudeville stage, and the picture isn't even halfway over yet!","popularity":0.3045,"poster_path":"/vV54urAUweIIeHC6J8Ooiu7ctfN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56557,"logo_path":null,"name":"Projectograph-Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1937-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who is Talked About","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Rühmann","original_name":"Heinz Rühmann","popularity":0.3479,"profile_path":"/va392zg2RW7laSTaKgqV9lvCiJg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Toni Mathis","credit_id":"52fe48059251416c9107d6cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Moser","original_name":"Hans Moser","popularity":0.4675,"profile_path":"/xnUAqGWMQZaFTEB9ikoP9vrUq8M.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Martin, Tonis Onkel","credit_id":"52fe48059251416c9107d6d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theo Lingen","original_name":"Theo Lingen","popularity":0.2556,"profile_path":"/98blRESQptTEdEGho7J65WeuPGd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Diener Haßler","credit_id":"52fe48059251416c9107d6d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":26147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gusti Huber","original_name":"Gusti Huber","popularity":0.115,"profile_path":"/m2fRNyh2HC6wcQidw4etYSRkcyd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bianca Zaratti","credit_id":"52fe48059251416c9107d6db","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Salfner","original_name":"Heinz Salfner","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Zirkusdirektor Zarratti","credit_id":"5716de1b9251412a7a0008dd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerhard Bienert","original_name":"Gerhard Bienert","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":"/iCFmDeSyZBMaVMZxCxC2cY8riRK.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dompteur Carasso","credit_id":"5716e005c3a3684122016497","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reinhold Häussermann","original_name":"Reinhold Häussermann","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/zsR0q3tv8W1EVto3XzVQhz5oXvQ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Clown","credit_id":"5716ebbec3a3686678013a52","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferdinand Mayerhofer","original_name":"Ferdinand Mayerhofer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Schneider","credit_id":"66f64cedde21a6b782509c3a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":590631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mizzi Zwerenz","original_name":"Mizzi Zwerenz","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Verkäuferin des Flohzirkus","credit_id":"66f64d0285633bf92296543b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Storm","original_name":"Otto Storm","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Hotelmanager","credit_id":"66f64d317b3072688d965dd1","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"E.W.
