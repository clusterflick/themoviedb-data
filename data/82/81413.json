But where does all this come from? Is the fish caught by a white-bearded captain with a crew of children? Does the chicken live on an idyllic farm with a rooster on the manure? And are pigs actually always happy and cows purple and colorful? The reality is different - a world full of battery hens, huge fish farms and slaughterhouses. Animals are production units - without a soul, without the right to a life. The main thing is cheap. This documentary provides unsparing insights into the depths of the factory farming industry and reveals the true origins of our food, free from suggestive advertising messages.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Product Animal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0889131","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
