For starters, a framing device has been added: After appearing in 300 consecutive appearances of Fledermaus (which translates as The Bat) the lead tenor (Georg Alexander) imagines that he's seeing bats everywhere. Driven a bit over the edge by all this, he falls asleep and has a nightmare about the opera, with a group of non-singers cast in the leading roles. The original libretto about romantic assignations, political imprisonments and mistaken identity is burlesqued to the hilt: at one point, the hero finds out that his prison cell is surrounded by rubber tubes!","popularity":0.1973,"poster_path":"/pVnvqsD2ftpzcGUvvXjcGBK2L31.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15693,"logo_path":null,"name":"Imagoton","origin_country":""},{"id":7448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tobis
