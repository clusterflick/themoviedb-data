After months of rigorous training in the north of Australia, a team of 14 men, most barely out of their teens, set sail from Cairns on board a leaky old fishing boat called 'The Krait'.  Their mission, code-named Operation Jaywick, became a tense voyage through thousands of kilometres of Japanese held territory to launch a daring attack on Singapore Harbour.  The raid is a success but within sight of safety they encounter a Japanese destroyer, and all prepare to die rather than be taken prisoner.","popularity":0.9136,"poster_path":"/hv5CofKX6dw7ElZ0KonqF9mzeDq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":208,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Heroes","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Rhys","original_name":"Paul Rhys","popularity":0.3317,"profile_path":"/l7uc38oZGMQbbq7WqE8rKn9xZJr.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Ivan Lyon","credit_id":"52fe48209251416c9108128b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bach","original_name":"John Bach","popularity":0.2821,"profile_path":"/v7l9SKwlTaMQiIfWwfUAP1Sd1nz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Donald Davidson","credit_id":"52fe48209251416c91081257","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":113552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Briony Behets","original_name":"Briony Behets","popularity":0.2547,"profile_path":"/kCUk2Nz2xhWUEvUPPqRiM7B5soW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alice","credit_id":"52fe48209251416c9108125b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bonney","original_name":"John Bonney","popularity":0.1527,"profile_path":"/1HUe3GAZKFSuovqrEvyRS4knjCB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rear Admiral","credit_id":"52fe48209251416c9108125f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Hargreaves","original_name":"John Hargreaves","popularity":0.1885,"profile_path":"/eOMsZ9noWLK5Axg8jE0hX324bbJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ted Carse","credit_id":"52fe48209251416c91081263","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron Daddo","original_name":"Cameron Daddo","popularity":0.5191,"profile_path":"/6oJz4Yu515JUjpfQ9SxdJ0a5Lpy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Joe Jones","credit_id":"52fe48209251416c91081267","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Morsley","original_name":"Christopher Morsley","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bob Page","credit_id":"52fe48209251416c9108126b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Donovan","original_name":"Jason Donovan","popularity":0.4743,"profile_path":"/bwQx8cbD9Rq8uPZ0vq1TPkPS4uX.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Happy Huston","credit_id":"52fe48209251416c9108126f","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":79381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donald Crombie","original_name":"Donald Crombie","popularity":0.1792,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48209251416c91081275","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79134,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Buckley","original_name":"Anthony Buckley","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/9eUruQfUOXnBF0iBqxqLW0vPU2h.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48209251416c91081287","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":94841,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Yeldham","original_name":"Peter Yeldham","popularity":0.1637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48209251416c91081281","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592189,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ronald McKie","original_name":"Ronald McKie","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48209251416c9108127b","department":"Writing","job":"Author"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0095297","wikidata_id":"Q12124764","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hv5CofKX6dw7ElZ0KonqF9mzeDq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
