The characters in this story are a man who is going to die, a woman who receives anonymous erotic notes, an older man who is offered a last chance at falling in love, a teenager struggling to handle the doubts generated by puberty and a small boy who sees ghosts. As is the case in many families, in spite of living together, all the characters in Pudor are alone.","popularity":0.5459,"poster_path":"/cvFhP17NlUKDEhRCzNSddAcK1AB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":256,"logo_path":"/zudWGGAiJHWL0xrkH9EtKT8Y5l4.png","name":"Tesela Producciones
