Set in the Bushveld near what is today the world famous Kruger National Park, this animated family tale is about Jock's adventures with Fritz, his master. Jock escapes death, builds crazy friendships and displays his unrivalled loyalty to Fritz. The story is set in the late 1880s when Africa's mineral richness, teeming animal life and incomparable natural beauty drew and captivated explorers and adventurers from all over the world. A place where big game roamed in their thousands and the wildest tales were true! Jock Of The Bushveld is a great story and the only animal classic to come out of Africa.","popularity":1.6377,"poster_path":"/u893BGceKy7cJnhyFEiAvMP1U5r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2011-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bravery Comes In All Sizes","title":"Jock the Hero Dog","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Jock: The Hero Dog","type":"Alternative Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Jock","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Jock of the Bushveld","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Джок","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Jock – Ein Held auf 4 Pfoten","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryan Adams","original_name":"Bryan Adams","popularity":0.4822,"profile_path":"/euHc6JOhHIGrZCuM7WXn9PQaOtW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jock (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48229251416c9108171d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Sutherland","original_name":"Donald Sutherland","popularity":1.5082,"profile_path":"/yM8WO2BYqFvgQXAvf4CIuCYnY4j.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator / Sir Percy Fitzpatrick (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48229251416c91081739","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Baldwin","original_name":"William Baldwin","popularity":1.8014,"profile_path":"/mFCUAl6Rko6ocONhFDCpztcmKXd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Boatman (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48229251416c91081721","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":203421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Bishop","original_name":"Anthony Bishop","popularity":0.2658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"George (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48229251416c91081725","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Danson","original_name":"Ted Danson","popularity":1.1514,"profile_path":"/2QUEYVhrKbOkRKeFEUnc5sJby6a.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pezulu (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48229251416c91081729","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Hunt","original_name":"Helen Hunt","popularity":2.019,"profile_path":"/aJVortGgkGkvK0DMiY0I7Fv77Qb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jess (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48229251416c9108172d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Makenzie Hart","original_name":"Makenzie Hart","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Young Jock (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48229251416c91081731","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mandy Patinkin","original_name":"Mandy Patinkin","popularity":1.5368,"profile_path":"/1PeZ6roZvkcoyZZbvoSIWTgGe3a.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Basil (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48229251416c91081735","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":951899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Kennett","original_name":"Jason Kennett","popularity":0.0524,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Snarly (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48229251416c91081779","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"De Pinna Michael","original_name":"De Pinna Michael","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Claude (voice)","credit_id":"52fe48229251416c9108177d","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duncan MacNeillie","original_name":"Duncan MacNeillie","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48229251416c9108173f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":71793,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jim Cox","original_name":"Jim Cox","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48229251416c91081745","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":544343,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Duncan MacNeillie","original_name":"Duncan MacNeillie","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48229251416c9108174b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":544343,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Duncan MacNeillie","original_name":"Duncan MacNeillie","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48229251416c91081751","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1056656,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fred L.
