WIR KOMMEN.","overview":"Hard, harder, hardest! This film orders you from the start to turn up the volume and pay attention. \"Look out! We're Coming to Get You!\" is a flood of images driven by a tempest of guitars. The film's creators jam 20 years of German music history into 120 minutes of film. Musicians from BLIND PASSENGERS, DIE SKEPTIKER, SANDOW and other bands explode their way through the film.  Fans of the DEFA documentary \"Flüstern und Schreien\" (\"Whisper and Shout\") already know the stars of that film, Aljoscha, Paul and Flake of the band Feeling B. Here they have a chance to see how these musicians survived the period after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the \"escalation of possibilities\" that came with it. And you're allowed to laugh, too!","popularity":0.1901,"poster_path":"/d901XR5OsBDlj3GQqTokchiBWEo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":213553,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tele Factory TV & Medien","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2008-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"We're coming to get you!","title":"Look Out!","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Wir kriegen euch alle!","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4377187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Beckmann","original_name":"Robert Beckmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1010,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6553e219d4fe0400fe055d4f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1515687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Kruspe","original_name":"Richard Kruspe","popularity":0.2234,"profile_path":"/gvFc5geScokaG0kZAiM65jPpvin.jpg","cast_id":1011,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6553e227ad50f000b57c25b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1515688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Landers","original_name":"Paul Landers","popularity":0.1543,"profile_path":"/hSgkxg65eAVEWauIjbImY6CKwqL.jpg","cast_id":1012,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6553e236ea84c71096dc60b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Till Lindemann","original_name":"Till Lindemann","popularity":0.5351,"profile_path":"/mhbcRcw5KRFxUbKFglHDHuo4XNI.jpg","cast_id":1013,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6553e241d4fe0400fe055d5c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Lorenz","original_name":"Christian Lorenz","popularity":0.1558,"profile_path":"/eVFwuhuOg2bejR5RLEqZb8aM9WR.jpg","cast_id":1014,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6553e25c67b61345cf04949c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Riedel","original_name":"Oliver Riedel","popularity":0.1416,"profile_path":"/8vLuztIqxATiJLdTeD2WXmjN4tU.jpg","cast_id":1015,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6553e2689653f613f629ca47","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4377190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aljoscha Rompe","original_name":"Aljoscha Rompe","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1016,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6553e27453866e011c069ca0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4377191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Zimmermann","original_name":"Christoph Zimmermann","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1017,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6553e27f53866e011c069caf","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":591985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl G.
