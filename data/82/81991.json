Holbrook adapted Twain's own words for a commentary on slavery, religion and politics, mixing the satire with comic yarns about life on the Mississippi and a very effective ghost story. The show's highlight are the lengthy passages from \"Huckleberry Finn\".","popularity":0.3528,"poster_path":"/lCCEuYWwZz3anX9JTFUJRalopIO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mark Twain Tonight!","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Holbrook","original_name":"Hal Holbrook","popularity":0.9126,"profile_path":"/cnhje99hbqldY1wimQTKpApvj1n.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mark Twain (Samuel Langhorne Clemens)","credit_id":"52fe48369251416c9108443d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":386135,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Don Silverman","original_name":"Don Silverman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48369251416c9108444f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47374,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Susskind","original_name":"David Susskind","popularity":0.2838,"profile_path":"/wDX0amVOTcV7Sdx4jdrpE8qiQBg.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48369251416c91084455","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Holbrook","original_name":"Hal Holbrook","popularity":0.9126,"profile_path":"/cnhje99hbqldY1wimQTKpApvj1n.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48369251416c91084449","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Bogart","original_name":"Paul Bogart","popularity":0.3933,"profile_path":"/bLw3lHR8L1kXA8jFel0eDShF3Xp.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48369251416c91084443","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0204468","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lCCEuYWwZz3anX9JTFUJRalopIO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
