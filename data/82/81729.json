Filmmaker Margarita Jimeno tracks their raucous gigs from 2001 to 2006, from NYC to Italy, as the band rises from dingy basements to festival main-stages. The cast is a rotating circus of polyglot personalities from Israel, Russia and America, who dish on their music, their heritage, and their favored vices. H端tz, a sardonic mustachioed Ukrainian immigrant and the group ringleader, fuses his gypsy heritage with a love of punk rock and burlesque. Part carnival barker, social organizer, and poet, he s a mesmerizing presence on-stage and off.  Gogol Bordello Non-Stop is an artful documentary that mixes flamboyant costumes, intricate dance choreography, a relentless beat and an explosive energy not seen since the dawn of rock n roll.","popularity":0.1118,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-09-11","revenue":5646,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa単ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A behind-the-scenes look at the gypsy punk band Gogol Bordello and their charismatic front man Eugene H端tz.","title":"Gogol Bordello Non-Stop","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Hutz","original_name":"Eugene Hutz","popularity":0.2894,"profile_path":"/uVofTndQHsmJ6OrsxvWaBUN0lVL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6499c28abbd0b001066fccee","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142854,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margarita Jimeno","original_name":"Margarita Jimeno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe48279251416c910822eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0477002","wikidata_id":"Q12124580","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"GOGOL BORDELLO NON STOP FILM TRAILER","key":"vVXhVMZmiNU","published_at":"2008-10-05T07:57:02.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6cdc3a3685448007627"}]}}}
