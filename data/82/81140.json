Otherwise, this minor yarn of an amorous streetcar conductor is strictly formula material. The film benefits from the star power of Paul Horbiger, resplendently garbed in an elaborate conductor's uniform. Also worth noting is the performance of Maria Andergest as the woebegone hatmaker whose fate is inextricably linked with hero Horbiger. Incidentally though the direction is credited with one E. W. Emo, Paul Horbiger actually called most of the shots on Endstation.","popularity":0.4805,"poster_path":"/nZIKVXfQHJkduBPjbFFmVW5AxSc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1935-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Stop","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Hörbiger","original_name":"Paul Hörbiger","popularity":0.2039,"profile_path":"/jrTXAidwAiHz5xW5M96uzvkTcDN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Karl Vierthaler, Straßenbahnschaffner","credit_id":"52fe47f89251416c9107bd17","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Moser","original_name":"Hans Moser","popularity":0.4675,"profile_path":"/xnUAqGWMQZaFTEB9ikoP9vrUq8M.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Karl Vierthaler senior, Oberkontrollor","credit_id":"52fe47f89251416c9107bd1b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josefine Dora","original_name":"Josefine Dora","popularity":0.1048,"profile_path":"/lnNXRUmoH8oKI6zTDWdIzAXYmwm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Frau Vierthaler","credit_id":"52fe47f89251416c9107bd1f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni von Bukovics","original_name":"Toni von Bukovics","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Frau Wendler","credit_id":"52fe47f89251416c9107bd23","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Andergast","original_name":"Maria Andergast","popularity":0.2469,"profile_path":"/eJ3cBq8BiuVNTrtFRflmxB3Szy9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Anna Wendler, ihre Tochter, Näherin","credit_id":"52fe47f89251416c9107bd27","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Sabo","original_name":"Oscar Sabo","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/AgrUzyzXmCA8b4albtaShdEltDE.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Schilling, Konditor","credit_id":"52fe47f89251416c9107bd2b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":591052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otti Dietze","original_name":"Otti Dietze","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Frau Schilling","credit_id":"52fe47f89251416c9107bd2f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":591053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eta Klingenberg","original_name":"Eta Klingenberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Rosa Schilling","credit_id":"52fe47f89251416c9107bd33","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubert von Meyerinck","original_name":"Hubert von Meyerinck","popularity":0.1624,"profile_path":"/8APjW4PoDWOX3EmP0JHBsB06dpJ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Marcel Steiner, Direktor des Salon 'Flora'","credit_id":"52fe47f89251416c9107bd37","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Serda","original_name":"Julia Serda","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":"/yge6rsRwy7KfxQqfznLUn5vsXa9.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Frau Hofrat Crusius","credit_id":"52fe47f89251416c9107bd3b","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oskar Sima","original_name":"Oskar Sima","popularity":0.2405,"profile_path":"/bQDZxEXLpQ2voIxflksqYzTF8uV.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Straßenbahninspektor Grenzing","credit_id":"52fe47f89251416c9107bd3f","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann Mayer-Falkow","original_name":"Hermann Mayer-Falkow","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Ein Schaffner","credit_id":"52fe47f89251416c9107bd43","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Sedlmayr","original_name":"Betty Sedlmayr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Mizzi","credit_id":"52fe47f89251416c9107bd47","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugo Flink","original_name":"Hugo Flink","popularity":0.0792,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Otti Staudinger","credit_id":"52fe47f99251416c9107bd4b","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":591056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolf Satzenhofer","original_name":"Adolf Satzenhofer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Portier","credit_id":"52fe47f99251416c9107bd4f","order":14}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"E.W.
