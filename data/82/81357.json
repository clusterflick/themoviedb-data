During the performance of 12 May 2011 at the London O2 Arena, David Gilmour appeared as a guest during this song, and both sang the choruses and played guitar from the top of the wall, echoing the original Earls Court performances.[18] The song contains one of the show's most memorable moments, when at a specific point in the final guitar solo, Waters runs to the wall, pounding it with his fists, triggering an explosion of colour in the previously dark grey projections.","popularity":0.0781,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roger Waters: Comfortably Numb  Live O2 Arena (With David Gilmour)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
