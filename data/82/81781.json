And it comes as no surprise that a former village doctor refers to the “Silvesterchlausen” in the hinterland of Appenzell as the “healthiest fever ever.” No one really knows where the custom comes from. But every year on December 31 and January 13, it touches the hearts of many people of all ages in the Appenzell region and beyond. The film tells of this virus, these emotions and traditions bridging the gap between several generations.","popularity":0.0931,"poster_path":"/k6ZXANOfVud8qH297Z3pEzR6qRk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Extramile Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2011-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silvesterchlausen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Rickenmann","original_name":"Thomas Rickenmann","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe482b9251416c91082b35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Rickenmann","original_name":"Thomas Rickenmann","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe482b9251416c91082b3b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Rickenmann","original_name":"Thomas Rickenmann","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633ad7dc87f3f20082876056","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3725272,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pascal Bernhard","original_name":"Pascal Bernhard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633ad7f6175051007c41dff0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Rickenmann","original_name":"Thomas Rickenmann","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633ad81c1750510084c4986e","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Rickenmann","original_name":"Thomas Rickenmann","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633ad7b887f3f20082876043","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Rickenmann","original_name":"Thomas Rickenmann","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633ad7cb42d8370082ed2720","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1954823","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":910,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ge502OKESDk64S0zDgHE9bI2Xwk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1619},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":911,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xnHbronGclOWSw6upmEPZwC7BL7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1619}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k6ZXANOfVud8qH297Z3pEzR6qRk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":303226,"name":"artfilm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
