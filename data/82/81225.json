A film poem about a continent at night, a culture on which the sun’s going down, though it’s hyper alert at the same time, an “Abendland” that, often somewhat self-obsessively, sees itself as the crown of human civilization, while its service economy is undergoing rapid growth in a thoroughly pragmatic way. Nikolaus Geyrhalter takes a look at a paradise with a quite diverse understanding of protection.  Night work juxtaposed with oblivious evening digression, birth and death, questions that await answers in the semi-darkness, a Babel of languages, the routine of the daily news, and political negotiation: All this has been captured in images with a wealth of details that make us look at things in a new way.  The longer you consider a word, the more distant is its return gaze: ABENDLAND.","popularity":0.4032,"poster_path":"/dPpj24uIgZy4NMkTBHnuJUuw1ZD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115599,"logo_path":"/oy7KfmJ1cVX4JlmheLukhHvrkox.png","name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2011-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abendland","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92005,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter","original_name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/fDepwh8iLOXyqHLeSntlN3GxhlA.jpg","credit_id":"52fe48029251416c9107cec9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92005,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter","original_name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/fDepwh8iLOXyqHLeSntlN3GxhlA.jpg","credit_id":"58e3172ec3a368732601615b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584713,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wolfgang Widerhofer","original_name":"Wolfgang Widerhofer","popularity":0.1458,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e317579251412810015d9c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584712,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Kitzberger","original_name":"Michael Kitzberger","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/ajrPuEw0tSTZmqnoVgceOnXnp5N.jpg","credit_id":"58e3174f9251412835016371","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92005,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter","original_name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/fDepwh8iLOXyqHLeSntlN3GxhlA.jpg","credit_id":"58e3173dc3a36872ee0178c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584711,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Markus Glaser","original_name":"Markus Glaser","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e31746c3a368731a017cb6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92005,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter","original_name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/fDepwh8iLOXyqHLeSntlN3GxhlA.jpg","credit_id":"58e3175e92514127e80174d8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584713,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wolfgang Widerhofer","original_name":"Wolfgang Widerhofer","popularity":0.1458,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e317739251412835016392","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584713,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wolfgang Widerhofer","original_name":"Wolfgang Widerhofer","popularity":0.1458,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e31726c3a36872af015088","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1609322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Arlamovsky","original_name":"Maria Arlamovsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e31735c3a36872f60166a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2125427","wikidata_id":"Q4666737","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/dPpj24uIgZy4NMkTBHnuJUuw1ZD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1415,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/6u407Mnxe7S3zQdmG0JUzMfEU3y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1576,"name":"technology"},{"id":1759,"name":"night life"},{"id":18420,"name":"surveillance"},{"id":159457,"name":"security"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ABENDLAND | Trailer [HD]","key":"SvolB_cf_Dg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-10-10T09:49:00.000Z","id":"5df00429ce4ddc00136262c6"}]}}}
