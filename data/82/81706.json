But a livelier agenda is established with \"Let the Good Times Roll,\" and the program expands to include pop, blues, Broadway, spirituals, and even a touch of patriotism in \"America the Beautiful.\" Cook has the biggest show-stopper: Cab Calloway's \"Minnie the Moocher.\" --Joe McLellan","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3 Mo Tenors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0390552","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
