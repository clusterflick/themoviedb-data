He produced sixty films in a stunning range of styles and techniques, collecting over 200 international awards, and world recognition. In Creative Process, director Donald McWilliams demystifies the process of artistic creation. Drawing on McLaren's private film vaults, a gold mine of experimental footage and uncompleted films, McWilliams explores McLaren's methods, including his celebrated \"pixillation\" technique, and his daring forays into animated surrealism.","popularity":0.2838,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Creative Process: Norman McLaren","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norman McLaren","original_name":"Norman McLaren","popularity":0.0871,"profile_path":"/rD180RxxIcxdCZbI2X5sfSb4lT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe481a9251416c910806ab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086468,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Grierson","original_name":"John Grierson","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/fVn3DN0fuvw7N4neRs1QxOqBH5F.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62b485acb5bc210595440cdf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grant Munro","original_name":"Grant Munro","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62b486a599c96400615e2c61","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gavin Millar","original_name":"Gavin Millar","popularity":0.1837,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Self - Interviewer (archive footage)","credit_id":"62b4871ab5bc210594c9aa1b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3599492,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Susan Huycke","original_name":"Susan Huycke","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"62b487353876510f41a78c83","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donald McWilliams","original_name":"Donald McWilliams","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe481a9251416c910806a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Dionne","original_name":"Claude Dionne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe481a9251416c910806a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3599492,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Susan Huycke","original_name":"Susan Huycke","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b48142a24c500cfb9eab41","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331997,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Douglas Macdonald","original_name":"Douglas Macdonald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b481a4a24c500d003261c1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46435,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Verrall","original_name":"David Verrall","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b481cc595a560053f40414","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donald McWilliams","original_name":"Donald McWilliams","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b4857d3876510f3fda8d04","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743957,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacques Avoine","original_name":"Jacques Avoine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6798219bb921c548d82ae018","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177247,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacques Leduc","original_name":"Jacques Leduc","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/loS8GxqZmGvpB8JXyiOx45pSlCe.jpg","credit_id":"679823a4a6e41283f12b51e0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59790,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pierre Letarte","original_name":"Pierre Letarte","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6798241ab921c548d82ae294","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3599501,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Robin L.P.
