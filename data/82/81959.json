When a geologist on the verge of a major diamond find is murdered, Corporal Michelle Kenidi and her partner Constable James Harper suspect a hotheaded entrepreneur who’d been double-crossed by diamond hunters. But then the town nurse disappears under chilling circumstances and the two cops find themselves tracking a phantom. Through endless miles of rough terrain, their search leads to a startling discovery: the unknown stalker’s real target is Michelle. Now the madman is playing a deadly game with people as bait. And when the two finally meet, it’s a showdown that will leave only one of them standing.","popularity":1.151,"poster_path":"/kKe7VkerEKNcS3OUc8VMYy4qInw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13773,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alberta Filmworks","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":22778,"logo_path":"/7LryUALIkPHEG0NnyRGcuRtYVhe.png","name":"SEVEN24 Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Blue Ground: A North of 60 Mystery","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"North of 60: In the Blue Ground","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1212572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Keeper","original_name":"Tina Keeper","popularity":0.1077,"profile_path":"/qLjKBIvRmKs6YjX98unFfyQe89O.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Michelle Kenidi","credit_id":"53641e800e0a2647ce000072","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":185120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracey Cook","original_name":"Tracey Cook","popularity":0.2679,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sarah Birkett","credit_id":"53641e900e0a2647db000066","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":610905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Bockstael","original_name":"Robert Bockstael","popularity":0.1898,"profile_path":"/1xN7igJj9AsT24TiD16QwromD3j.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cpl.
