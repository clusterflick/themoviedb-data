This documentary film – the first ever about Eno – explores his life, career and music between the years 1971 & 1977, the period that some view as his golden age. Featuring numerous exclusive interviews, contributions from a range of musicians, writers, collaborators and friends – plus performance and studio film and an abundance of the most exceptional music ever created.","popularity":0.2939,"poster_path":"/o0YtTvG0iU6WEI9H50SBYuFA6er.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6614,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chrome Dreams
