The film is made up of four parts: love, death, love, and death. Each part follows one of the two songs Asmahan sings in the film which are used as a structural motif throughout. Like her musical notations, every shot is connected to every other shot. Nearly every shot contains Asmahan (she is the only actor in the film who appears to be talking), which is meant to create an obsessive relationship with the image reminding us of the interplay of voyeurism and exhibitionism that makes the actor that we see on the screen dream like, especially when she also sees us. This dream logic suggests that there is a hidden life, which exists through pictures, lurking in even the most superficial and trite of B-films. It is this fragment-like wholeness that is in a sense the structure of the film. As in a dream, Asmahan's actions are accentuated through a number of strategies.","popularity":0.0532,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asmahan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1181454,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Salah Abu Seif","original_name":"Salah Abu Seif","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d4f28dc3a3687b9900219b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498385,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hisham Bizri","original_name":"Hisham Bizri","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d4f27d92514102c30027ab","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498385,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hisham Bizri","original_name":"Hisham Bizri","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d4f23092514102c8002826","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498386,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yusof Wabhi","original_name":"Yusof Wabhi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d4f245c3a3687b99002193","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498385,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hisham Bizri","original_name":"Hisham Bizri","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d4f220c3a3687b9900218a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498387,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sami Breal","original_name":"Sami Breal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d4f26ac3a368507f002bd4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498385,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hisham Bizri","original_name":"Hisham Bizri","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d4f25d925141154e001fe6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1737099","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
