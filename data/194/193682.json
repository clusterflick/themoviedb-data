This documentary explores our society on the verge of turning ubiquitous - a wireless society, where the laws of time, space and distance are revolutionizing the concept of liaison. Do the consequences of the technological revolution increase our freedom, or do they limit us? Is it possible to find a balance between one's natural rhythm and the society that spins at an ever increasing and demanding speed? Are we chasing echoes of our lost inner wholeness in our everyday lives, which are becoming busier and more fragmented than ever before?","popularity":0.1551,"poster_path":"/fzhPUVd16d0VJdUEsddFpp2n9h6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2011-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Five Star Existence","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Five Star Existence","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Virtuaalinen vapaus","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1761199,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pekka Uotila","original_name":"Pekka Uotila","popularity":0.1298,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626cee8c245dbe00993e8e90","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88023,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Flinckenberg","original_name":"Peter Flinckenberg","popularity":0.1398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626cee73fcadb40050714281","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174050,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sonja Lindén","original_name":"Sonja Lindén","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cd59251416c911019ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1426710,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Samu Heikkilä","original_name":"Samu Heikkilä","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6043958518b751005ac76105","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174050,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sonja Lindén","original_name":"Sonja Lindén","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6043952a8813e40059de95d7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264282,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stina Gardell","original_name":"Stina Gardell","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":"/p0tRsQTGVF4s7Bspl54g50E8nbB.jpg","credit_id":"604395c65258ae005a7ebd75","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174050,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sonja Lindén","original_name":"Sonja Lindén","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604395b672c13e00461bf01c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124864,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Janne Laine","original_name":"Janne Laine","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":"/7RMPfxYRGusRg2KDyMLr1xUxbq9.jpg","credit_id":"60439576c4ad590058f838ec","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1338258,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rebekka Karijord","original_name":"Rebekka Karijord","popularity":0.1628,"profile_path":"/qpWXwOqIUHCJTIVba7rZ60lMpmP.jpg","credit_id":"604395a4d185720077948402","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1426710,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Samu Heikkilä","original_name":"Samu Heikkilä","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60439593e18b970044ce9912","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1623727","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fzhPUVd16d0VJdUEsddFpp2n9h6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":714}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1576,"name":"technology"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
