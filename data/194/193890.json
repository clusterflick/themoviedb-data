That film was extraordinary then for having multiple scenes and a semblance of a narrative; additionally, the use of dissolves as transitions in it influenced other filmmakers for years to do the same. Méliès was the cinema world's preeminent leader then. By 1912, however, that was no longer the case; frankly, as evidenced by this feature, his style had become dated. Moreover, Méliès had begun to adopt techniques from other filmmakers, such as direct cuts instead of dissolves, and there's even a match on action shot during the slipper trying-on scene.","popularity":0.1706,"poster_path":"/tBA5kfn2MQtoLNx8TTmSDQ7m3Jb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star Film","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1912-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinderella or The Glass Slipper","video":false,"vote_average":5.594,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Baile Até à Meia-Noite","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"VE","title":"Cenicienta o la zapatilla de cristal","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1207298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Lagrange","original_name":"Louise Lagrange","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/qK5UQLmq6hPrd0KeG0X11VIvyAQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cendrillon","credit_id":"556c10849251414262000c26","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109342,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Feyder","original_name":"Jacques Feyder","popularity":0.0924,"profile_path":"/bSqyPHzYvVAWE5tmCR4iA3r7HwZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Prince","credit_id":"556c108cc3a368591c000d85","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marthe Vinot","original_name":"Marthe Vinot","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/sOD3kDHgzOfs7wnAUii0iYEQ5re.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"556c1094c3a36858fd000c7a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":0.1982,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cdc9251416c911028cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342256,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Pathé","original_name":"Charles Pathé","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/lEg4WcfsnEjO95bnO3ipL21ASZv.jpg","credit_id":"556c10abc3a36854890054a3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0132026","wikidata_id":"Q3664380","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tBA5kfn2MQtoLNx8TTmSDQ7m3Jb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":179411,"name":"based on fairy tale"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
