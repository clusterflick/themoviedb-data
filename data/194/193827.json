But Mr. August's refusal to get mixed up in a street brawl makes him look like a coward to Ms. Pickford. Meanwhile, convict Alfred Paget has escaped from prison; and, he is \"A Beast at Bay\". While Pickford and August go for a ride in her automobile, criminal Paget ambushes one of his guards, taking the man's clothing and gun. Pickford drops off August, still arguing he is a coward, and drives off. Alone, Pickford gets out of her car to retrieve a fallen garment; then, on-the-lam Paget moves in to carjack her. From a distance, August witnesses Pickford being taken at gunpoint - can he save his girl, and prove he's not a coward?","popularity":0.5678,"poster_path":"/7all82KMNGsJz2XgnG5dPVWOWyP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Beast at Bay","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Une bÃªte aux abois","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Pickford","original_name":"Mary Pickford","popularity":0.6455,"profile_path":"/y0FHoj9AjmVveKkdeFuqhuVYaTf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Young Woman","credit_id":"52fe4cda9251416c911024bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin August","original_name":"Edwin August","popularity":0.1212,"profile_path":"/cpnHZ8of3zIXpsGG6jsLl7dCZ8s.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Young Woman's Ideal","credit_id":"52fe4cda9251416c911024c1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Paget","original_name":"Alfred Paget","popularity":0.2494,"profile_path":"/rGXy9gRwMRb6GhU8bQeReH56hsJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Convict","credit_id":"52fe4cda9251416c911024c5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Harron","original_name":"Robert Harron","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/8uqveFAwItcd5Ty2OEMPM37bbZb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"A Farmer","credit_id":"52fe4cda9251416c911024c9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Marsh","original_name":"Mae Marsh","popularity":0.2742,"profile_path":"/1PDFSBQCwJ1yteuffEJgwSrAVra.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Young Woman's Friend","credit_id":"52fe4cda9251416c911024cd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William A.
