He plays it in the streets, in the park, in the streetcar (at least when he does not miss it!). When he unfortunately walks under a piano clumsy removers are hauling, the heavy instrument falls down on him and he swallows his clarinet.

Three farriers finally succeed in making him return to his former self.","popularity":0.3409,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14354,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société Générale des Cinématographes Éclipse","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1912-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Artheme Swallows His Clarinet","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Dupin's Clarinet","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Artemo e il clarinetto","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1174172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernest Servaès","original_name":"Ernest Servaès","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Arthème","credit_id":"52fe4cdc9251416c911028db","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1174172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernest Servaès","original_name":"Ernest Servaès","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cdc9251416c911028d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1548764","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1639,"name":"clarinet"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Artheme Swallows his Clarinet","key":"cb3Rurdahk8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2009-04-26T12:42:03.000Z","id":"66c7f0bf1d1b81b2cf29b297"}]}}}
