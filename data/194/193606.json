David journeys to the parts of the world which have had special meaning to him during his 50 years of broadcasting. Beginning near his boyhood Leicestershire home, where he first collected fossils, he then travels to Morocco's arid deserts, the glaciers of Canada and crystal clear waters of Australia's Great Barrier Reef.  As a prelude to the First Life series, Attenborough's Journey provides a unique insight into the mind and character of one of the world's most iconic broadcasters as he shares his passions for the natural world. Combining his global journey for First Life and archive material looking back at his illustrious career both as a programme maker and a controller of the BBC, the film reveals what makes him tick.","popularity":1.0744,"poster_path":"/4VzcTGyfAqiWTueTzColmn0n5v3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Attenborough's Journey","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Attenborough","original_name":"David Attenborough","popularity":1.4236,"profile_path":"/tt3LW3XftcvxOZtMXmIaJSWFN7y.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4cd39251416c91101587","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115298,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Geffen","original_name":"Anthony Geffen","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4cd39251416c911015a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2540815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Williams","original_name":"Martin Williams","popularity":0.1754,"profile_path":"/sFr1QRmWxMCYfgKXwb2gokCNQ2y.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e86b68066e4690014a6839b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1173981,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Lee","original_name":"David Lee","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cd39251416c91101593","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115298,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Geffen","original_name":"Anthony Geffen","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cd39251416c9110158d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2540815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Williams","original_name":"Martin Williams","popularity":0.1754,"profile_path":"/sFr1QRmWxMCYfgKXwb2gokCNQ2y.jpg","credit_id":"5e86b6959974ee0017b05a89","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2540815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Williams","original_name":"Martin Williams","popularity":0.1754,"profile_path":"/sFr1QRmWxMCYfgKXwb2gokCNQ2y.jpg","credit_id":"5e86b6903f7e1d00175d5226","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1772244","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jZj1cjsB0oaGhiyZ3BgipGCglBa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xRj5ituwyTZ4WjB5c1lB4YdsvjX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8XUtXVADBdFEI3N2ucSbBfA4Fr3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4VzcTGyfAqiWTueTzColmn0n5v3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"hu","file_path":"/qR6X5gInUcVlQBghWOPfI3Ax8mU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4627,"name":"earth"},{"id":9935,"name":"travel"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BBC - Attenborough's Journey (2010) - 01","key":"BWuNudCkSko","published_at":"2011-05-14T18:20:56.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"533ec70dc3a368544800a902"}]}}}
