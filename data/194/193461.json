It's a completely unmotivated but thoroughly spooky encounter between Mayuko and a demonic ghost, and she's saved by an ancient priest spirit who explains her legacy. \"Why does this always happen to me?\" she ponders before flying off to a remote island to investigate an ancient curse and battle a legendary Sea Demon. Mayuko befriends a burly, chivalrous detective and a little orphan boy nicknamed \"the Devil's Child\" who hides his own dark secret.","popularity":0.6116,"poster_path":"/Ap0AMlbLDLNz3aA9RHYSB6Sa6Wl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3656,"logo_path":"/mY6L0bHRp8fNWfICPqLjxp3khvq.png","name":"GAGA Communications","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1996-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beneath the waves...
