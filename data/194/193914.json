Thanks to a rope and pulley system cows climb skywards then disappear into the hold of the sailing vessel. On the bank, black-haired women rock back and forth, bursting out laughing and showing the first signs of going into a state of trance. Never-before filmed gestures and faces of the people of the Nile succeed one another, uprooted to an unknown, magical world. The Banks of the Nile is one of the first experiments of film in colour that uses the Kinemacolor process.","popularity":0.7789,"poster_path":"/1SgvUPJbp1J7lcveF4Rb8B8LD1Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44771,"logo_path":"/bfyrVfFnmmcanicDhqD9PNxbUHw.png","name":"Charles Urban Trading Company","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1911-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Banks of the Nile","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les rives du Nil","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Rive del Nilo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Nubia, Wadi Halfa and the Second Cataract","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129166,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Urban","original_name":"Charles Urban","popularity":0.1383,"profile_path":"/dNxgCHHNpdOWDGDy0YJzs9rAEFA.jpg","credit_id":"54c3a88f9251416185001483","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129166,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Urban","original_name":"Charles Urban","popularity":0.1383,"profile_path":"/dNxgCHHNpdOWDGDy0YJzs9rAEFA.jpg","credit_id":"54c3a8cb9251416e6000f2dd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4068292","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w62GtRHsmC0ZCD88EvzpByVgSjK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/drKYIhIoeczFBrDRq5qVzM6jd43.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1SgvUPJbp1J7lcveF4Rb8B8LD1Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/adxAzyQEY8o8E2PTwkABUr6X0in.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1160,"name":"egypt"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"},{"id":204233,"name":"ethnographical"},{"id":208869,"name":"etnography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1911-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rive Del Nilo Banks of the Nile year 1911 kinemacolor","key":"PwiFz1JumOE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2010-02-19T12:59:54.000Z","id":"65bd167b2d1e4001845dfd09"}]}}}
