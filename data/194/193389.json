Using technology created by George Washington Carver, a three-person crew (plus one rambunctious robot) lift-off in Earth's first working spaceship on a mission that will take them to a world not unlike present-day America. Their spacey adventure illuminates some hard truths about American culture, and threatens to undermine the time-line of history along the way.","popularity":0.6148,"poster_path":"/yZtMbw8HDKmT0FxWPJbi84IeGGb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Destination: Planet Negro!","video":false,"vote_average":6.333,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tosin Morohunfola","original_name":"Tosin Morohunfola","popularity":0.1813,"profile_path":"/emzxrwBlEepClAhks7YHS06Yhpx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Capt.
