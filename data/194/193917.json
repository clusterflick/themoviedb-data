In 1911, few women got education beyond primary school (especially in the big cities that were full of immigrants). Because of this, women were very limited in their employment options and received very low wages. The idea of this one year trade school was to help these young ladies get a leg up on a variety of trades. Oddly, much of what you see in the film does not seem that related to job skills--such as physical education","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jbIuqRkS2mHZ0sHAjXDkTXhJ72g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manhattan Trade School for Girls","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1187030","wikidata_id":"Q128600992","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2996,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jbIuqRkS2mHZ0sHAjXDkTXhJ72g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1997}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1911-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
