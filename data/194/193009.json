When Paris of Troy, ambassador and son of the king, arrives in Sparta, he kidnaps Helen and brings her to Troy where the two fall in love. The Greeks attempt to siege the city walls of Troy, but fail. The Greeks then place a huge wooden Trojan horse with Greek warriors hidden inside under the walls of Troy, pretending to be dedicated to the gods and ending the war. Falling for the trap, the Trojans break down the city walls to bring the wooden horse inside.","popularity":0.5417,"poster_path":"/dEuvTxFG8P2eMNj9cXfyb5v4BCs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1227,"logo_path":null,"name":"Itala Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1911-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fall of Troy","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":19,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"La caduta di Troia","type":"Original Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luigi Romano Borgnetto","original_name":"Luigi Romano Borgnetto","popularity":0.0871,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b91701bc3a3687ae5002419","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovanni Casaleggio","original_name":"Giovanni Casaleggio","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b91702e9251412d21002587","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2123026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madame Davesnes","original_name":"Madame Davesnes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5b917043c3a3687ae5002472","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2123027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilio Gallo","original_name":"Emilio Gallo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The King","credit_id":"5b91705bc3a3687ad6002a57","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Giannini Novelli","original_name":"Olga Giannini Novelli","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5b91706a0e0a26404a002b6f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2123028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giulio Vinà","original_name":"Giulio Vinà","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5b9170759251412d320027f5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luigi Romano Borgnetto","original_name":"Luigi Romano Borgnetto","popularity":0.0871,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cbc9251416c910fe95f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41611,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanni Pastrone","original_name":"Giovanni Pastrone","popularity":0.1037,"profile_path":"/dU5FZLU78TWOjdP8qRn1GRrUc6o.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cbc9251416c910fe965","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41611,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanni Pastrone","original_name":"Giovanni Pastrone","popularity":0.1037,"profile_path":"/dU5FZLU78TWOjdP8qRn1GRrUc6o.jpg","credit_id":"5b916fe10e0a264044002d36","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0002083","wikidata_id":"Q3821535","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1321,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jYvvwtcFNeKMT70Hf6SrLOcn73n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2348}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dEuvTxFG8P2eMNj9cXfyb5v4BCs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.737,"height":1010,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uVgocqwclND03E2Ptxtvub74S1R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":744}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3265,"name":"trojan war"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1911-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
