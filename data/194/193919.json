He made a script and used a camera from his father's shop. This became his first film, Wigwam, with his own family as cast. Black Eagle, a bad Indian, kidnaps the daughter of a farmer's family. Flaming Arrow, played by the young director, saves the child from the kidnapper and brings her back to her family. No better conclusion than smoking a peace pipe. Although filmed in the spring of 1912, the film had a theatrical release in December 1915.","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/z5P2Sl7OcZD22RkcR7weCa8SFoK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1912-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flaming Arrow","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Flaming Arrow","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La flecha ardiente","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"De Brandende Straal","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La flecha ardiente (1911)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joris Ivens","original_name":"Joris Ivens","popularity":0.2496,"profile_path":"/fNUOfmwxX37zV05kkbK4EFSrAfY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Flaming Arrow","credit_id":"552fbf3892514114e600137a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Ivens","original_name":"Peter Ivens","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Black Eagle","credit_id":"599a2d0792514149c5008a22","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothea Ivens","original_name":"Dorothea Ivens","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"599a2d1792514149cc008aa3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Ivens","original_name":"Hans Ivens","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"599a2d1d92514151ad001b68","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacoba Ivens","original_name":"Jacoba Ivens","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"599a2d2492514149c5008a4b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodora Ivens","original_name":"Theodora Ivens","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"599a2d2dc3a36839640082e0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1873613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willem Ivens","original_name":"Willem Ivens","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"599a2d33c3a3683978008543","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joris Ivens","original_name":"Joris Ivens","popularity":0.2496,"profile_path":"/fNUOfmwxX37zV05kkbK4EFSrAfY.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cde9251416c91102b2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5017328,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kees Ivens","original_name":"Kees Ivens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6718f984a4ac8a432c5bde27","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joris Ivens","original_name":"Joris Ivens","popularity":0.2496,"profile_path":"/fNUOfmwxX37zV05kkbK4EFSrAfY.jpg","credit_id":"6718f98d2685cb6563c07700","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0164232","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z5P2Sl7OcZD22RkcR7weCa8SFoK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"Priv√©vertoning","release_date":"1912-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-12-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
