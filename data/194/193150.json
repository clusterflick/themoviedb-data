The city is presented as a place where people from all corners of the world live, who all exert their cultural influence on the life in the city. With a motor courier as his central figure, the filmmaker introduces the audience to birds of different feathers. We see diverse cultural expressions, like the house scene, the entry of St. Nicholas and a Ghanese mourning ritual. The binding factor in the film is the concept of 'travelling', in other words Amsterdam as a global village. The camera travels through the film in three ways: over land, over water (canals) and through the air.","popularity":0.1479,"poster_path":"/73eV0lriytctUoXg3BFv7PwYtKB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1996-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":245,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amsterdam Global Village","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan van der Keuken","original_name":"Johan van der Keuken","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/zPqpgZaXeXe02OFiiikL5kg58RP.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cc19251416c910ff2c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan van der Keuken","original_name":"Johan van der Keuken","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/zPqpgZaXeXe02OFiiikL5kg58RP.jpg","credit_id":"61a86a854a52f8006432cfd1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332347,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dionys Breukers","original_name":"Dionys Breukers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a86a9727ff9900447d21c5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan van der Keuken","original_name":"Johan van der Keuken","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/zPqpgZaXeXe02OFiiikL5kg58RP.jpg","credit_id":"61a86ab03d4d960045a1d800","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan van der Keuken","original_name":"Johan van der Keuken","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/zPqpgZaXeXe02OFiiikL5kg58RP.jpg","credit_id":"61a86abe27ff9900668ccdd2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291822,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Barbara Hin","original_name":"Barbara Hin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a86acd38469a0068e0115b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noshka Van der Lely","original_name":"Noshka Van der Lely","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a86ae40486380091aa1535","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0115537","wikidata_id":"Q106097120","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":738,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7UBcqLGcrcijKa5O2uY2oD908OO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1312},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":738,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/btXdRyNd1EyGTfhC9JyZiLzBmHa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1312},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":738,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3hpjErXpcScUYFPVfDfgdIhPOFo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1312},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":738,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eEfuHL1RQWg71uvxm1D57giXdx7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1312}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1057,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gFoxOCrb8GFyH3Vm8iMbCZJYYlU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":705},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/73eV0lriytctUoXg3BFv7PwYtKB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
