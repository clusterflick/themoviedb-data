A title card tells us this is an experiment in conveying the mental images of music in a visual form. Liszt's \"Second Hungarian Rhapsody\" is the music. The shapes, all two-dimensional, are circles primarily, with some squares and rectangles, and a few triangles. The shapes move rhythmically to the music: receding from view or moving across the screen. Red circles on a blue background; light blue squares; white rectangles. Then, a red background of many circles with a few in the foreground. Red gives way to blue then to white. Shapes reappear as Liszt's themes re-occur. Then, with a few staccato notes and images, it's over.","popularity":0.1687,"poster_path":"/1yAfkkvRsmK8rbJD2m5W905jb56.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1938-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Optical Poem","video":false,"vote_average":6.643,"vote_count":35,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oskar Fischinger","original_name":"Oskar Fischinger","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":"/6NjYxPvqwubzilB9nOlkm1H9ipx.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cd49251416c911018c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1719739,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Franz Liszt","original_name":"Franz Liszt","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":"/9gf7QB9tqywJgoD8YGQ8bQh4NGf.jpg","credit_id":"67711e7e769852f29012f964","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0029350","wikidata_id":"Q65762893","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":773,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hz7Z4JasDXpVDpuZGeHfcN98k7N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1374}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1yAfkkvRsmK8rbJD2m5W905jb56.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pokgqXg7jOX2NtAd7naE6ExpvoA.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":4,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":204091,"name":"shapes"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1938-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
