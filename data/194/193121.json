Her husband, Pete (Bologna), the head coach of the Phoenix Suns, finds out he can't produce another child. Kathy thinks about adopting a boy, Frederic \"Freddie\" Wilcox, and Pete does not want to adopt a boy who happens to be black. When he relents, Freddie's arrival causes an upheaval in the Morrison's neighborhood, their school, and family. Kathy's answer is to adopt another child, in this case two, a war-traumatized half-Vietnamese girl, Quan Tran, and a Hopi boy, Joe. The new extended family must now learn to live together.","popularity":1.0925,"poster_path":"/eaOdf0cl0wtByJsc06qxpxad5Xt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60530,"logo_path":null,"name":"Llenroc
