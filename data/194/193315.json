The film component of the performance was ultimately never screened due to the absence of projection facilities at the venue. Long-believed to be lost, a workprint was discovered in 2008 and the film had its premiere in 2013.","popularity":0.9395,"poster_path":"/3M5nR79sR1CASVvMMiM1lLTas6T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mercury
