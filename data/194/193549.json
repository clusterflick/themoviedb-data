A silent movie-style opening title informs us that the town needs a new fire engine, so they decide to stage a play to raise the money. (Nothing more is heard about this, but the finale involves a fire emergency at the theater.) In the opening scene the community players rehearse at the home of the director, a pompous lady named Mrs. Winters. Harry, of course, is The Stage Hand.","popularity":0.0656,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":174163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Educational Films Corporation of America","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stage Hand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1022678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Langdon","original_name":"Harry Langdon","popularity":0.1561,"profile_path":"/AuL3EB6cPn57RpdGkT3dgAqnb1s.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Harry","credit_id":"52fe4cd19251416c9110111d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4665127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marel Foster","original_name":"Marel Foster","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"662417742e2b2c0187665918","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1017631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Shubert","original_name":"Eddie Shubert","popularity":0.0848,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6624177ee894a601643a1219","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4665128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ira Hayward","original_name":"Ira Hayward","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6624178507faa20163986cf9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4665129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maryen Lynn","original_name":"Maryen Lynn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6624178b07faa20163986d04","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4665130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rollin Grimes","original_name":"Rollin Grimes","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6624179362f335017dd86a37","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Hammill","original_name":"Harry Hammill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6624179f62f335017dd86a42","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1022678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Langdon","original_name":"Harry Langdon","popularity":0.1561,"profile_path":"/AuL3EB6cPn57RpdGkT3dgAqnb1s.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cd19251416c91101119","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1597915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Davis","original_name":"Eddie Davis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662417d607faa20163986d20","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1022678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Langdon","original_name":"Harry Langdon","popularity":0.1561,"profile_path":"/AuL3EB6cPn57RpdGkT3dgAqnb1s.jpg","credit_id":"662417adaf9590014a66e07b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0024608","wikidata_id":"Q63498486","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1933-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
