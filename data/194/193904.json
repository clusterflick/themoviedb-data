In this follow-up film, Ode to the Dawn of Man, Herzog shows us an insight into the construction of the film’s score with footage and interviews with composer Ernst Reijseger and pianist Harmen Fraanje. Ode to the Dawn of Man draws us into the creation of the truly epic music used in Herzog’s awe-inspiring documentary and the magic created by all those involved including the musicians, composer and Herzog himself. –iTunes","popularity":0.2943,"poster_path":"/6bC4vnvO0bsHayAWqRifsuNWrtq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":843,"logo_path":null,"name":"Werner Herzog Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ode to the Dawn of Man","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4019756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Bergin","original_name":"Sean Bergin","popularity":0.1215,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6440b8cbfcec2e02fcd89e90","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4019757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harmen Fraanje","original_name":"Harmen Fraanje","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6440b8d81750510459a23dbe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54902,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ernst Reijseger","original_name":"Ernst Reijseger","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":"/2G9WjjNbjTv3XkYmduUhIAN8zQJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6440b8e8b3f6f5049c9d2418","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Herzog","original_name":"Werner Herzog","popularity":0.9989,"profile_path":"/qKlz1oM482Xf0jTPfLiR6qXlLYK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cdd9251416c91102a25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Herzog","original_name":"Werner Herzog","popularity":0.9989,"profile_path":"/qKlz1oM482Xf0jTPfLiR6qXlLYK.jpg","credit_id":"6440b8fefcec2e0439d89ba1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Herzog","original_name":"Werner Herzog","popularity":0.9989,"profile_path":"/qKlz1oM482Xf0jTPfLiR6qXlLYK.jpg","credit_id":"6440b904e2bca804df428a92","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1498686,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maya Daisy Hawke","original_name":"Maya Daisy Hawke","popularity":0.0581,"profile_path":"/mKZ8eJhaJwgqFSdRXwuqqeGId5S.jpg","credit_id":"6440b90e651fcf045e9bb9d3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2425831,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex Bushe","original_name":"Alex Bushe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6440b92817505102fba23db1","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2069061","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6bC4vnvO0bsHayAWqRifsuNWrtq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
