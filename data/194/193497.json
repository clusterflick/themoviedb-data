During filming he held the camera upside down and afterwards put the images ‘up right’ again in the film. By doing this, we see the ‘usual’ waterfront, but transformed by the rippling of the water. In this way Mirror of Holland became a modern looking experimental film. However this did not devalue the Dutch sentiment regarding waterfronts that are so trusted to so many.","popularity":0.5775,"poster_path":"/xc3Gba7OvQ0sT8t4XLC0le6JXXW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Forum Film","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1950-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mirror of Holland","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":23,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Spiegel van Holland","type":"Original"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Зеркало Голландии","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Haanstra","original_name":"Bert Haanstra","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":"/eZ5IJ3iq95lntxhshy5dAmW4zn3.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cce9251416c91100c2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Haanstra","original_name":"Bert Haanstra","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":"/eZ5IJ3iq95lntxhshy5dAmW4zn3.jpg","credit_id":"594500bd9251413fad00e3a8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3711231,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Piet van Moock","original_name":"Piet van Moock","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6718c9ed427c5c19f02596e1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Haanstra","original_name":"Bert Haanstra","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":"/eZ5IJ3iq95lntxhshy5dAmW4zn3.jpg","credit_id":"6718cb80c7802cc50359a568","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Haanstra","original_name":"Bert Haanstra","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":"/eZ5IJ3iq95lntxhshy5dAmW4zn3.jpg","credit_id":"6718cb884542e371fe0a1d17","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0042990","wikidata_id":"Q2148663","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r2Yc9C80GT0QYAHnJmX5pqRfD1b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xc3Gba7OvQ0sT8t4XLC0le6JXXW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/6Rn1q4J6j7yIARhc45Ow4g5Y8g0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1889,"name":"lake"},{"id":1261,"name":"river"},{"id":1199,"name":"netherlands"},{"id":10365,"name":"holland"},{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"},{"id":34041,"name":"canal"},{"id":269412,"name":"poetic documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
