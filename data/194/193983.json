The film is about five minutes long, and sandwiched between these aforementioned shots we see a collection of scenes of bathers on a beach. The majority of them grin at the camera like loons and follow it around like filings attracted to a magnet.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jNVLg1NxSjnAM35WQB2Ji4ErA0G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1910-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Im Wannseebad.","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"On Wannsee Beach","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0347234","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jNVLg1NxSjnAM35WQB2Ji4ErA0G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1910-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Wannseebad - 1910","key":"bsw8UkzfP-Y","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-01-31T21:03:31.000Z","id":"6758644de528400caac1bfc5"}]}}}
