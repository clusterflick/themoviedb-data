Nina is often sour and tempestuous, but with Gino she's spontaneous and funny. Yet the friendship often founders, as the feckless Gino spoils Nina's frequent and demanding plans. They decide to rob Gino's rich uncle to pay for bombs and creature comforts, they sneak into a stranger's house, they steal a painting belonging to one of Gino's boyfriends, bombs fail to explode, and Gino costs Nina the trust of her anarchist pals. Then comes the crocodile test, the ultimate for any friendship.","popularity":0.2943,"poster_path":"/kjM8HkJjaOHPSEydMNhp4bqloao.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crocodiles
