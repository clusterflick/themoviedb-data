Reluctantly, he allows his oldest daughter to work in the mill. Meanwhile, in New York, the wealthy businessman Hanscomb is being urged to speak out against child labor, but he declines to do so. Then, while Mrs. Hanscomb and her daughter are traveling, the young girl accidentally wanders away, gets lost, and is taken in by the working class family. To help them, she takes a job in the mill. While this is taking place, Hanscomb has initiated a search for the daughter even as he goes about building up his financial empire.","popularity":0.2436,"poster_path":"/seD1jeAnqp2AxwzkR9v2moezx1Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children Who Labor","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1683391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Conness","original_name":"Robert Conness","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/mTQyjRPGzUWJp3fmZhSD2RItMX8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"631ea375b0cd20007d2b72da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Nesbitt","original_name":"Miriam Nesbitt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/yXzMNXHYQaNVf96UI0cidc6wwVc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"631ea37bb234b90087a5ac22","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1361345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirley Mason","original_name":"Shirley Mason","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/mtz8dvcq9n2f72hsgZWDCLyExpZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"631ea381b0cd20007a61bd87","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Sturgeon","original_name":"John Sturgeon","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"631ea38dbd3209007ad107a8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Fuller","original_name":"Mary Fuller","popularity":0.0939,"profile_path":"/7XIkKyvcJ8aEmhZNctVOjDCudMH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"631ea3980bb076009286b30d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viola Dana","original_name":"Viola Dana","popularity":0.0829,"profile_path":"/xkE1eRGSmOdgi4IPfgSWzRiYrEZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"631ea3a0481382007ae8bd57","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1056719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ashley Miller","original_name":"Ashley Miller","popularity":0.1187,"profile_path":"/jD0MALzpSckQG3PD5h9WEoXbn5T.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cdc9251416c91102835","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1463160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Browning","original_name":"Ethel Browning","popularity":0.0569,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"631ea365ce9e91007f7558bd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0002098","wikidata_id":"Q3674620","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/seD1jeAnqp2AxwzkR9v2moezx1Q.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6dld47Ay5Rjj6CLkPuLGSftcEty.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
