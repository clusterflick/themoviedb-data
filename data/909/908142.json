Fearful of what is to come, the old man fades, withdrawing into himself as the threat of death looms. His daughter, Lin, does her best to care for him but struggles with also being a newly single-parent to 19-year-old Ben, who is reeling from his parents’ divorce as well.  One night, Kheng encounters Ben’s EDM (Electronic Dance Music) playlist and is inexplicably hooked. To everyone’s surprise, the music brings Kheng to life and introduces a world where death sentences are drowned out by deafening beats. The music gradually brings the family together, revealing unlikely lessons about how to love, live, and be happy, in the strange and wonderful rave that is life.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Before You Die, Have You Lived Without Regrets?","title":"Scene City Season 3: The Old Man And The Scene","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uqzzM3K4d7Q1FgcGP76cxBt6381.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
