Children of the depression, they graduated into a media culture mobilized around the propaganda needs of WWII, and worked at the forefront to advance knowledge about communication, social influence, politics and celebrity. Through personal stories they illuminate the experiences of a generation, narrate history from the margins and reflect upon women, media, and the art of inquiry in ways that still resonate today.","popularity":0.0789,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of the Question: Women, Media and the Art of Inquiry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3330145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thelma Ehrlich Anderson","original_name":"Thelma Ehrlich Anderson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"61a649e8c044290065f27642","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3330146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Doris Goldhamer","original_name":"Joan Doris Goldhamer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"61a64a2e85c0a20021705950","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3330147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Engel Lang","original_name":"Gladys Engel Lang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"self","credit_id":"61a64a4738469a0068dd30ea","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3330148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thelma Herman McCormack","original_name":"Thelma Herman McCormack","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"self","credit_id":"61a64a61c044290043873869","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3330149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yole Granata Sills","original_name":"Yole Granata Sills","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"self","credit_id":"61a64a740486380029805bd8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2989228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naomi McCormack","original_name":"Naomi McCormack","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a63949be4b360098756b20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1664761","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
