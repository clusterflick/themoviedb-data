It is an analytical documentary film, with a “destruens part” and a “construens part”: arises from the awareness that digital is one of the concauses of the crisis of journalism. But at the same time, it is in the digital world that there are chances to get out of this crisis, because the web is an ecosystem and, like all ecosystems, contains prey and predators, problems and solutions. Because the digital world is real. Digital is part of reality and as we shouldn’t demonize it. Digital is a medium. Men and women acts. “Slow News” is a journey around the world, looking for all those journalistic realities that have chosen to slow down or be “viral responsibly”.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/bMvp4D2yz9NxRjzlPK6X1cIV9lf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134230,"logo_path":null,"name":"IK Produzioni","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slow News","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2546898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Puliafito","original_name":"Alberto Puliafito","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec680133d3557001eee1007","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2546898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Puliafito","original_name":"Alberto Puliafito","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec67fe48e2e0000201e909b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647363,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alessandro Zangrossi","original_name":"Alessandro Zangrossi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec680359979d200213832ba","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647362,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fulvio Nebbia","original_name":"Fulvio Nebbia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6804d9979d2001f34295f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647361,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrea Coccia","original_name":"Andrea Coccia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec67ff25a5ed0001f438cd0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647362,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fulvio Nebbia","original_name":"Fulvio Nebbia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec680260fb17f001b7a4d97","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647365,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonio Sernia","original_name":"Antonio Sernia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6803f5a5ed0001f438cf1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647362,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fulvio Nebbia","original_name":"Fulvio Nebbia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec67ffd8e2e00002123dfdf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647362,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fulvio Nebbia","original_name":"Fulvio Nebbia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6801f140bad001d192636","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15070216","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":827,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bMvp4D2yz9NxRjzlPK6X1cIV9lf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":551}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Thessaloniki Documentary Festival (online)","release_date":"2020-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
