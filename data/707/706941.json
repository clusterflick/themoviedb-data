Nisida, a 90-year-old widow, moved by her faith, decides to undertake a pilgrimage to the Hermitage of San Bartolomeo. Nicola, a retired fisherman, lives with a white cat in the ruins of his village. Three solitary figures, in the land of Abruzzo, resilient to time and carrying on the old ways, who tune into the “pace of the water.” A contemplative and atmospheric homage to the ancient peasant tradition, as well as a farewell nod to a vanishing way of life.","popularity":0.0936,"poster_path":"/irtpf6cxr0ixLBFA9Osjk7chSLX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16006,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zelig Cinematografica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pace of Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647941,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Di Biase","original_name":"Antonio Di Biase","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6e5f2d2147c0023be10b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647942,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mattia Ottaviani","original_name":"Mattia Ottaviani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6e5ff6c8492001f2988fd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647943,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aaron Beitz","original_name":"Aaron Beitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6e609d2147c0023be10bd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2193825,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrea Oppo","original_name":"Andrea Oppo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6e6138e2e000021245e6f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647944,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Riccardo Marsana","original_name":"Riccardo Marsana","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6e61d9979d2002138a524","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2068801,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tommaso Barbaro","original_name":"Tommaso Barbaro","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6e628d71fb40020d10788","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326415,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Massimo Mariani","original_name":"Massimo Mariani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6e6338e2e003dd611de63","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11121630","wikidata_id":"Q100773657","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/irtpf6cxr0ixLBFA9Osjk7chSLX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":699}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
