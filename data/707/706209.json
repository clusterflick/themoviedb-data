The video documents and further explores Graham's investigations of the urban environment, from Abbe Laugier's theory of the Rustic Hut to Parisian shopping arcades, wintergardens, museums, Disneyland and corporate office buildings. For the Dia Center in New York City, Graham developed an environment, analogous to a small-scale urban park, which integrates aesthetic and utilitarian functions, and spatial and visual experiences, bringing the landscape into the roof and extending the roof into the landscape. Graham writes: \"The pavilion structures are psychologically and socially self-reflective. There is a dialectic between the perception of oneself and other bodies perceiving themselves, making the spectator conscious of him or herself as a body.","popularity":0.0482,"poster_path":"/71bqMQ0rjWRemITMLW0KU9hhOqX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20988,"logo_path":null,"name":"Electronic Arts Intermix","origin_country":""},{"id":134146,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dia Center for the Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two-Way Mirror Cylinder Inside Cube and a Video Salon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2079199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Graham","original_name":"Dan Graham","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/5feaFYTGsj6ckJpkD49d8n7fzOr.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"5ec4230d37b3a9001f199c51","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2645121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanton Miranda","original_name":"Stanton Miranda","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ec423302dffd80022721eaa","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2645097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernst Mitzka","original_name":"Ernst Mitzka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec420a76c849200212819a1","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2645098,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karen Kelly","original_name":"Karen Kelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec420c12dffd80022721a4c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2645112,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Richard Dallet","original_name":"Richard Dallet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec421c06905fb0020a11b6b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2645113,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Inwood","original_name":"John Inwood","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec421dc9979d2002134de81","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2645116,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Glenn Branca","original_name":"Glenn Branca","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec4220e81c7be001dbfe5a4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2079199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Graham","original_name":"Dan Graham","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/5feaFYTGsj6ckJpkD49d8n7fzOr.jpg","credit_id":"5ec422918e2e0000201bfcb2","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2079199,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Graham","original_name":"Dan Graham","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/5feaFYTGsj6ckJpkD49d8n7fzOr.jpg","credit_id":"5ec422f237b3a9001f199c37","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael H.
