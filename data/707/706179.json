Through the book of XO Elias Tsoukalas who escaped capture and had to swim for nine hours to reach shore, secret documents, and crew members’ diaries, the documentary unfolds the human stories woven around the submarine. Seventy-five years later, with the support of the Hellenic Navy, we search for the submarine sunk at 253 metres depth and film the wreck for the very first time.","popularity":0.4499,"poster_path":"/mCXP7kB0HN2WlavPm56LGvBrGqk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":29241,"logo_path":"/nyMt6dCgAKnOjbU6trNQXpIlUw4.png","name":"2|35","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":211794,"logo_path":null,"name":"FAOS","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Y1: Silence of the Deep","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Υ1 – Στη σιωπή του βυθού","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2255033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bilio Tsoucala","original_name":"Bilio Tsoucala","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ec40f06a055ef0022979c9e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2644991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filippos Vardakas","original_name":"Filippos Vardakas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec40f228e2e000021205b35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644992,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Magda Georgiadou","original_name":"Magda Georgiadou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec40f3428723c001f4cec8d","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644993,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stelios Efstathopoulos","original_name":"Stelios Efstathopoulos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec40f438e2e000021205b4b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644994,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aggelos Aggelidis","original_name":"Aggelos Aggelidis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec40f57140bad001d15b4a7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644995,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tasos Maurogiannis","original_name":"Tasos Maurogiannis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec40f656905fb0021a11e3b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644996,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adreas Doutsias","original_name":"Adreas Doutsias","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec40f732dffd80022720a00","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2644993,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stelios Efstathopoulos","original_name":"Stelios Efstathopoulos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec40faf3d3557001de24b8b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14777734","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mCXP7kB0HN2WlavPm56LGvBrGqk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":679}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":658,"name":"sea"},{"id":3588,"name":"navy"},{"id":339,"name":"submarine"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":1200,"name":"greece"},{"id":4759,"name":"exploration"},{"id":222859,"name":"sunken submarine"},{"id":224626,"name":"british navy"},{"id":227684,"name":"ship wreck"},{"id":248356,"name":"german occupation of greece"},{"id":266473,"name":"katsonis"},{"id":266474,"name":"greek navy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"Greek, English, German, French","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Y1 – The Silence of the Deep / Filippos Vardakas, 2019","key":"0aKAXKwYccQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-03-11T11:09:09.000Z","id":"5ec410f581c7be001fbfb15d"}]}}}
