Unfortunately, his plan fails to take into account language barriers, ancient racism and the tendency of medieval men to commit murder. Instead of learning from these Great Men of History, our hero has no choice but to hunt them down and blast them to the past before they can ruin our future.","popularity":0.5733,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":923,"logo_path":"/5UQsZrfbfG2dYJbx8DxfoTr2Bvu.png","name":"Legendary Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Rumored","tagline":"","title":"Any Person, Living Or Dead","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":466505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kumail Nanjiani","original_name":"Kumail Nanjiani","popularity":1.4544,"profile_path":"/9EyrK1Cv7ey1h1GgmsVAOn45w6G.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec6458e5a5ed0002043769c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1267186,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Rich","original_name":"Simon Rich","popularity":0.2676,"profile_path":"/svrleZfE2vFfJsroNtiZ33hHguN.jpg","credit_id":"5ec645a85a5ed00021437054","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1267190,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Heather Anne Campbell","original_name":"Heather Anne Campbell","popularity":0.1479,"profile_path":"/t6kM3FUszf9hUJSNLn0DvHeXr71.jpg","credit_id":"5ec645bf5a5ed0001f436cc6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212431,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jonathan Krisel","original_name":"Jonathan Krisel","popularity":0.1593,"profile_path":"/pxrlLJKeNStv1w0x61LFwiZCcrE.jpg","credit_id":"5ec645df3d3557001eedcf85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10130862","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
