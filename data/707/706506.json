Here Nikolaus Harnoncourt, renowned for his analytical approach to the search for the core of the music, interprets Mozart’s last opera. Martin Kušej, who is acclaimed for his theatre productions directs the production. Nikolaus Harnoncourt identifies with Mozart’s score as both an extremely knowledgeable musician and a conductor who invariably plays an active part in helping to shape the drama. Together with the Vienna Philharmonic, he savours the miracles of Mozart’s late work, bringing out its instrumental colours and effects and at the same time stimulating his singers while proving a solicitous accompanist.","popularity":0.1789,"poster_path":"/cajVgDEFwgL7HsyoFlAZMvSOgtk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart - La Clemenza di Tito","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Schade","original_name":"Michael Schade","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec5335b9979d2001f330cd2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":471356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elina Garanca","original_name":"Elina Garanca","popularity":0.2021,"profile_path":"/2xLi7RtxE1j2FQMuaXvVXkRjIr2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec533636c8492002029d394","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1004025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothea Röschmann","original_name":"Dorothea Röschmann","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/xrVdPsmL4rVDnKNgAF4XMaOcMrU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec5336c6c8492002029d399","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Pisaroni","original_name":"Luca Pisaroni","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":"/56uiFd7X9xJmPPJLFvaulZz6kV5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec533743d3557001eec6ed8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","original_name":"Wiener Philharmoniker","popularity":0.1507,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff35200fab3fa003b769bfc","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116774,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Kušej","original_name":"Martin Kušej","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec533919979d200213689d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225552,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nikolaus Harnoncourt","original_name":"Nikolaus Harnoncourt","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/tkitTZcuAjS98Ogz59BjYnLcovm.jpg","credit_id":"5ec533863d3557001eec6ede","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2259,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cajVgDEFwgL7HsyoFlAZMvSOgtk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
