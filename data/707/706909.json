It shows the artist’s foot repeatedly kicking the camera around a clean, quiet domestic space until the video blacks out. The victim of the booting, the camera itself, is recording the footage we see. The viewer is disoriented by the film’s upsetting of the conventional relationship between documenting and participating, which makes the camera complicit in the act.","popularity":0.07,"poster_path":"/3WP0AsHBCSusycU5qcZbZqJtk7U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Domestic (as long as it lasts)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Gordon","original_name":"Douglas Gordon","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ec6d7e0e635710020ccfcb3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Gordon","original_name":"Douglas Gordon","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6d7d7d2147c0022b95919","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3WP0AsHBCSusycU5qcZbZqJtk7U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Gagosian Online - Broadcast: Alternate Meanings in Film and Video","release_date":"2020-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
