His dad was a legend of the Circle of Death and so were his uncle and his grandfather – a family tradition for over 50 years!

A human portrait of an old-school lover of speed in a rapidly changing world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cF2zA7CRkXa5xe76Bp3SCtvnpoi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spiros and the Circle of Death","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lino Kafidas","original_name":"Λίνο Καφίδας","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6e8ce140bad001b182dfd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647953,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Toon Persyn","original_name":"Toon Persyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6e9058e2e00002124610f","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647951,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Omiros Komninos","original_name":"Omiros Komninos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6e8e5ae2811001f3c1ee7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647952,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Nick Cannaerts","original_name":"Nick Cannaerts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6e8f1d2147c0023be1308","department":"Art","job":"Title Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lino Kafidas","original_name":"Λίνο Καφίδας","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6e8a76c849200202bf96f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lino Kafidas","original_name":"Λίνο Καφίδας","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6e8b0d71fb40021d100d9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lino Kafidas","original_name":"Λίνο Καφίδας","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6e8d89979d2002138a853","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitris Kafidas","original_name":"Δημήτρης Καφίδας","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6e89bbd990c0021b5303c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12268472","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cF2zA7CRkXa5xe76Bp3SCtvnpoi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
