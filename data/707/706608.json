Out the outskirts of Marseille, in a landscape criss-crossed by motorways, railways and srubland paths, some figures that seem to be from her famous photos passby and bump into each other. They act as our guides in a tour without beginning or end. How do you look at a place without taking possession of it? How do you describe characters without confining them within a given plot? How do you make the transition from still shots to moving pictures? this brief, musical film leaves us asking these and other unresolved questions.","popularity":0.4053,"poster_path":"/vaZw0m7stcx5xtnIS7BXXvHpPiM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2003-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grand Littoral","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2079874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valérie Jouve","original_name":"Valérie Jouve","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec58afa0c0b3800206ca8d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0396620","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vaZw0m7stcx5xtnIS7BXXvHpPiM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":916,"name":"marseille, france"},{"id":175985,"name":"landscape"},{"id":210052,"name":"urbanism"},{"id":253043,"name":"road"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Belfort Entrevues Film Festival","release_date":"2003-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Torino Film Festival","release_date":"2003-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
