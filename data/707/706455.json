Wells called \"The Country of the Blind\"â€”about a man who travels to a country of blind people and attempts to dominate their sensual, feminine culture with his male, sight-derived power. Following this theme, \"Blind Country\" begins with animated fruit dancing over Mike Kelley's body and the admonition of \"Northerners\" to \"refill the quickly emptying sack.\" In the male-dominated land of the North, candy-spurting pinatas stand as phallic symbols. Presumably castrated, and stripped of his authority, Kelley acts the buffoon as he is led through the murky land of the South, a \"female,\" earthy, \"realm of the senses\" opposing the phallocentric world of the North.","popularity":0.314,"poster_path":"/tnmip3g3usJFxJ3lghdGvPbjHN7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
