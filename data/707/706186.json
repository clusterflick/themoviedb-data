Неизвестная Беларусь","overview":"For nearly 10 years, Belarus has had a Shelter — place for women victims of domestic violence. This is a big private house in Minsk. Many victims are brought here directly in their home clothes — the only thing they were able to escape from the aggressor. Belarus has not yet adopted a law on combating domestic violence. In this issue, you will find out the real stories of residents of the Shelter, what problems not only clients but also employees of the shelter have to face, and why it is so important to pass a law.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9J5KY3HK9euvW3bUGoTK7WTIAlB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unknown Belarus.
