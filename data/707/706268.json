A woman is seen placing three lamp stands at the center, left, and right of the screen and then moving them gradually into the foreground - the surface of the screen- in several distinct stages. As she makes a move she turns the lights on and off. Finally she clusters the three stands at the center of the screen but in such a way that the lamps themselves, the light source for the film, are cut off by the top of the frame yet still illuminating the screen. The woman walks off-screen once she has completed this action. The placement and movement of the lamp stands and the use of negative in this film serve as a literal demonstration of the way in which light affects the perceptual quality of the film image.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/wLlA6psfOFJUraU3DRaTWcrUIRA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bringing Lights Forward","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2525571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Haxton","original_name":"David Haxton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/o4UOTzv5WxfhExqmos7h6q45g1Z.jpg","credit_id":"5ec450426c8492001f2807e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wLlA6psfOFJUraU3DRaTWcrUIRA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
