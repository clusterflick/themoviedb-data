The film is not so much a documentation as it is an exploration into the dark corners of modern Lebanon’s collective memory in an attempt to discover how much of who we are is based largely on that part of ourselves we have chosen to forget.","popularity":0.0654,"poster_path":"/qc1TAWb5MgfIrgsh7HHoOtVYImV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2567,"logo_path":"/wia94WcCrJC8SXxTcEqeqQS66Hk.png","name":"Abbout Productions","origin_country":"LB"},{"id":84790,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dubai Entertainment and Media Organization","origin_country":""},{"id":77941,"logo_path":"/bf4n8o2RNnjxpyMxYtcckoh5oXY.png","name":"Front Row Filmed Entertainment","origin_country":"AE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"}],"release_date":"2011-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sector Zero","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2392262,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nadim Mishlawi","original_name":"Nadim Mishlawi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62c1a13a9672ed19e87b95b2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4794669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Khoury","original_name":"Bernard Khoury","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"667b13a1fd72ccfdce5a3812","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chawki Azoury","original_name":"Chawki Azoury","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"667b13ae68fbb6fd819073a1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4794670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hazem Saghiyeh","original_name":"Hazem Saghiyeh","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"667b13c09f218251f3f6a179","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3294510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadim Shartouny","original_name":"Nadim Shartouny","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667b138df86f8146c6d9c73f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2392262,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nadim Mishlawi","original_name":"Nadim Mishlawi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667b13589c8a61cd815a37db","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2392262,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nadim Mishlawi","original_name":"Nadim Mishlawi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667b133863504181959072e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290187,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Georges Schoucair","original_name":"Georges Schoucair","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667b136dc021fd409199b2b0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1949061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Talal Khoury","original_name":"Talal Khoury","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667b137c08b865e0345a374e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2392262,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nadim Mishlawi","original_name":"Nadim Mishlawi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667b13438c4df3f9b34cc14e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2125609","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/htbqGX4qwPgR7Z1xjWZQjDxvsbD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qc1TAWb5MgfIrgsh7HHoOtVYImV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":637}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Dubai International Film Festival","release_date":"2011-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Sector Zero - Trailer","key":"W7DriIvs5gc","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2011-11-28T11:42:51.000Z","id":"667b13ecf3358a4741d9c76b"}]}}}
