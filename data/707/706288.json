It includes some of his greatest and most attractive music, from the patriotic flourish of Fanfare for the Common Man and the spirited orchestral fantasy El Salón México, to the colloquial warmth of his suite from the opera The Tender Land. Of particular importance is the collaboration with the great Benny Goodman in the masterwork he commissioned and premiered, the Clarinet Concerto.","popularity":0.1225,"poster_path":"/qDGlDeRfg4Ng4WkF4UwPU1bENDO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Copland Conducts Copland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57684,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aaron Copland","original_name":"Aaron Copland","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/54sMNh45BtoNJsWv8r6rSchb8Sa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Composer and conductor","credit_id":"5ec45d9bcaab6d0020901af8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benny Goodman","original_name":"Benny Goodman","popularity":0.1085,"profile_path":"/tojEK20KJbrh3nixdKg0dPfZQQU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Clarinet","credit_id":"5ec45dbfcaab6d0020901b0e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1238017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirk Browning","original_name":"Kirk Browning","popularity":0.1402,"profile_path":"/sqqMIpAeowuV9dFVYHmgeocOGMr.jpg","credit_id":"5f957d1b9f51af003402f68e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qDGlDeRfg4Ng4WkF4UwPU1bENDO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
