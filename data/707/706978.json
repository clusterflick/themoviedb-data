In this film no grandiose scenes, just a river of silver flowing placidly between low banks, covered with trees. Here and there we pass through delightful little towns until we get to Windsor and dock in the shade of its famous castle.","popularity":0.072,"poster_path":"/10P9i7muVxDxn1ITl2QkyDRwTiX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1914-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Banks of the Thames from Oxford to Windsor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342256,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Pathé","original_name":"Charles Pathé","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/lEg4WcfsnEjO95bnO3ipL21ASZv.jpg","credit_id":"5ec7023f8e2e0000201f069b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30792143","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/10P9i7muVxDxn1ITl2QkyDRwTiX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"LES BORDS DE LA TAMISE D’OXFORD À WINDSOR • 1914","key":"XEBsiuXdzMM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-12-08T00:45:50.000Z","id":"6759636f39b533d942486b23"}]}}}
