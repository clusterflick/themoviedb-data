Though they are icons of the Southwest, rattlers are often persecuted as venomous villains. A handful of states still hold annual roundups to collect and kill as many snakes as possible.

Join him on a road trip through the Wild West as he busts myths and rescues a few rattlers along the way.","popularity":0.0695,"poster_path":"/rXEVKUicRlrTEmxs2bTaKCaHhzx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18894,"logo_path":"/rFr30k0B8DgdZtPHjzAtQIJ3XDH.png","name":"Smithsonian Channel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rattlesnake Road Trip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10163140","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1432,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rXEVKUicRlrTEmxs2bTaKCaHhzx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
