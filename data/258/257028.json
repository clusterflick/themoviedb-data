Stretched on a hammock, Juan de Dios must resign to \"sinking himself in the boredom, just like a castaway at sea\". But suddenly he realizes that \timmobility is something impossible:  Juan de Dios sees himself overwhelmed by a myriad of physical, sound, optical and olfactory sensations,which awaken his spirit. After three hours of this contemplation, he announces his departure in the next day.
