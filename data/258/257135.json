The sisters quarrel amiably, but they share a wounded history that becomes revealed as the tale unfolds.  An earnest but unworldly young man named Husband travels up from the South to board with the sisters while he searches for his beloved Lou Bessie, who left their small town a few years back to find a new life.  Husband would like to bring Lou Bessie back home, but she's enamored with the excitement of the city, and her plans are more complicated. In time, Elizabeth and Husband begin a courtship that may or may not overcome their considerable age difference, while Quilly reacts disapprovingly.","popularity":2.2747,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20403,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chocolate Swan Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":20404,"logo_path":"/5qbeKB2Hq7ItbUQHrfTOUBQE9ta.png","name":"KCET","origin_country":"US"},{"id":20405,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Bird Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Harlem 1943.
