Renowned Lithuanian documentarist Audrius Stonys took these words as a motto for his latest film, a meditative visual essay which portrays old people undertaking all kinds of activities, meditation and group laughter therapy. Without a single word of commentary, he creates from sophisticated, aesthetic images a compelling study of human corporeality which, in an ideal union with spiritual equilibrium, can sustain us with the pledge that old age doesn't have to be a painful wait for the last breath.","popularity":0.3281,"poster_path":"/8EeuSyJUjPUjQ0mOyRLgS9W6c8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16661,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARTE GEIE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2006-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uku ukai","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297787,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Audrius Kemežys","original_name":"Audrius Kemežys","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53133c39925141102a00611c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297954,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arūnas Stoškus","original_name":"Arūnas Stoškus","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53133c9c9251411013005f50","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1007605,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Audrius Stonys","original_name":"Audrius Stonys","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/ltmJd9kDSOKkcSgNHbi23IczTJg.jpg","credit_id":"53133c239251411013005f42","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1007605,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Audrius Stonys","original_name":"Audrius Stonys","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/ltmJd9kDSOKkcSgNHbi23IczTJg.jpg","credit_id":"53133c12925141104d006226","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297953,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Viktoras Juzonis","original_name":"Viktoras Juzonis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53133c799251411035005ea9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297957,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vidmantas Bartulis","original_name":"Vidmantas Bartulis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53133ccb9251411035005eb5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":927436,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Danielius Kokanauskis","original_name":"Danielius Kokanauskis","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/pw94GSlRoD9G7BJAfVragQAekpT.jpg","credit_id":"53133c529251411013005f4a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525203,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giedrius Puskunigis","original_name":"Giedrius Puskunigis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/nW53y9atoYCm2f3jildb0s1aLjm.jpg","credit_id":"5bd473340e0a2622bf0175e4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117992,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jóhann Jóhannsson","original_name":"Jóhann Jóhannsson","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/6TWdYn3opC6l5FBGACpTVbJn3yC.jpg","credit_id":"5f22d6a4caaca20036673b4a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0904007","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8EeuSyJUjPUjQ0mOyRLgS9W6c8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":197056,"name":"meditative"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
