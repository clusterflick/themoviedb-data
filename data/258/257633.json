As the quiet country village gets busy preparing funeral, the house in mourning becomes a meeting place where villagers gather to ask how they are getting along and meet old friends. The children mourn their father's death and above all Mi-Seon, who caused her parents a lot of grief, can't stop crying. Chan-Wu, the chief mourner, has a revelation about his career, and Chan-Se prepares to sing hymns for the Confucian funeral service. Old Man Park's sister sells insurance products and gradually the funeral service becomes for the living rather then the dead.","popularity":0.2557,"poster_path":"/faaUQsR8JQuFbHLdhl9gE1sLPlA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"1996-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell My Darling","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Haksaeng-bugun-shinwi","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Hagsaengbugunsin-wi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":553705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Song Ok-suk","original_name":"송옥숙","popularity":0.6368,"profile_path":"/yZUoMkzBxUjXsua8p6cFG8erR6F.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Madam Go","credit_id":"571b057292514135ff0001c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Choi Sung","original_name":"최성","popularity":0.0787,"profile_path":"/repGnv8lyX9IPrrMqxjRlno37IO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ah Beo-ji","credit_id":"58c49b0fc3a3681670003850","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":945428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ju Jin-mo","original_name":"주진모","popularity":0.3253,"profile_path":"/1qTItiktKLOBRX00xIqx8GO0TXk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Chal-kil","credit_id":"58c49bedc3a368167000392d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pang Eun-jin","original_name":"방은진","popularity":0.221,"profile_path":"/lOZRwcO5HezyxLjYqCS3DwFLH0Z.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Geum-dan","credit_id":"58c49c13c3a36816bc003ab4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":559999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moon Jeong-suk","original_name":"문정숙","popularity":0.2389,"profile_path":"/r44cQ8DYw4LBcZxcYwBc74jveJG.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63d18fa0cb71b80081022c9d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3890706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kwon Sung-duck","original_name":"Kwon Sung-duck","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Hosang","credit_id":"63d19044a410c8125be65f8f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Il-woo","original_name":"김일우","popularity":0.3051,"profile_path":"/buVSCt4ESDwG3cWauVDdyVrS9Dg.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Palbong","credit_id":"63d190be9e45860079cdec59","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Cheol-su","original_name":"박철수","popularity":0.1454,"profile_path":"/g9qRmonLSaBBT3IrdX1t63qNHsP.jpg","credit_id":"5312b1f49251410ffc0041cf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Cheol-su","original_name":"박철수","popularity":0.1454,"profile_path":"/g9qRmonLSaBBT3IrdX1t63qNHsP.jpg","credit_id":"5312b1db925141102a0041da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3890798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Yong-man","original_name":"김용만","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":"/uZu53PXYoRzTO3b6cWWtbb9ZXGN.jpg","credit_id":"65c372538e2e000183a649f0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291104,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Seong-yong Byeon","original_name":"Seong-yong Byeon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d18ecccb71b80085dd559f","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3657731,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chi Sang-hak","original_name":"Chi Sang-hak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d18df99f51af00b67cac0e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0119106","wikidata_id":"Q16192047","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7haiFRWrs5JmLnpDQ22pSgxuQdw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":924,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/faaUQsR8JQuFbHLdhl9gE1sLPlA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":644}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
