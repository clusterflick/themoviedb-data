Their neighbours Joe (Charles Victor) and Emma (Gladys Henson) are constantly in the Twiggs house, borrowing a cup of sugar or using their Anderson shelter and between them the two working class families put the world to rights. But when their daughter falls for an upper class RAF pilot the Twiggs are asked by his mother, Lady Diana Stephens to tell their daughter to call the romance off, as the social gap between the families is too large. Incensed by Lady Diana s offer of money, Sam Twigg throws her out of the house. But events take a sudden turn as the war enters the Twiggs own living room. Will the two families manage to overcome their disdain for each other and let true love find its way?","popularity":1.3203,"poster_path":"/vkWwzbhNB9iPuxU9mpwp0jsDkNP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20381,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Studios Manchester","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1953-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those People Next Door","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Warner","original_name":"Jack Warner","popularity":0.3721,"profile_path":"/4bW0BaqxwcZptpRVFF3AGTWmGTe.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Sam Twigg","credit_id":"530cfa09c3a3685bf40015d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Victor","original_name":"Charles Victor","popularity":0.2984,"profile_path":"/li71y0A4pcmf5MxhNQrVngqPEhY.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Joe Higgins","credit_id":"530cfa17c3a3685c2000153f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":127023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjorie Rhodes","original_name":"Marjorie Rhodes","popularity":0.1044,"profile_path":"/h1Jn0YMWgZfyb5AspQb305prB4v.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mary Twigg","credit_id":"530cfa25c3a3685c030015b1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":559081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Henson","original_name":"Gladys Henson","popularity":0.1559,"profile_path":"/7x0O62dDJwxy7QdijCF9mUTpp6U.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Emma Higgins","credit_id":"530cfa36c3a3685bee001614","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Cutts","original_name":"Patricia Cutts","popularity":0.3766,"profile_path":"/4M4NrWFVVLqs8nPgXPYoc19gtXB.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Anne Twigg","credit_id":"530cfa43c3a3685c28001584","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garry Marsh","original_name":"Garry Marsh","popularity":0.2896,"profile_path":"/zJz144HUdUc4cVuQma5ql9SZFXX.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Sir Andrew Stevens","credit_id":"530cfa5bc3a3685c20001542","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":123908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Arnold","original_name":"Grace Arnold","popularity":0.1198,"profile_path":"/2Z3sS79wdRsORNAyuUrXu2p9kYr.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Lady Diana Stevens","credit_id":"59ac15acc3a3682c4802a885","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Newley","original_name":"Anthony Newley","popularity":0.3455,"profile_path":"/aPKqp2ICDkgCMIgbeUj7CI53FY1.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Bob Twigg","credit_id":"530cfa7ec3a3685bfb001591","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":131690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norah Gorsen","original_name":"Norah Gorsen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Margaret Twigg","credit_id":"530cfa8dc3a3685bfb001593","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoffrey Sumner","original_name":"Geoffrey Sumner","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/8u6Eo1HZarqwb7psgZnixOAWzMP.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"F / Lt Claude Kimberley","credit_id":"530cfa9fc3a3685c2f001549","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1226593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Forbes-Robertson","original_name":"Peter Forbes-Robertson","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"S / Ldr.
