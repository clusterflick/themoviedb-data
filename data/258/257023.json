One of the most elaborate manifestations of this was the 1931 Exposition Coloniale Internationale, held in Paris to celebrate ‘la France des 5 continents’. This exhibition sought to represent to the people of France their colonial world by reordering and reconstructing it into scenes or tableaux of everyday indigenous life. This entailed shipping over scores of indigènes and forcing them to act out the gestures of their ‘everyday lives’ under the eyes of 1930’s Parisian society. A slightly less elaborate, although equally controversial at the time, visual representation of The Other was one of the first film documentaries to be made which sought to represent the lives of a colonised people, Marc Allégret’s Voyage au Congo.","popularity":0.1431,"poster_path":"/6zCwPcShvNoVpLrrJtOrjiMTObR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1927-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voyage au Congo","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Allégret","original_name":"Marc Allégret","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/5s6ntUxcDNMhjRjFccNbSJ4FVqs.jpg","credit_id":"605cb66cbfeb8b0074639dc9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065701,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"André Gide","original_name":"André Gide","popularity":0.0924,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605cb66523be4600748b5e70","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marc Allégret","original_name":"Marc Allégret","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/5s6ntUxcDNMhjRjFccNbSJ4FVqs.jpg","credit_id":"530be9f992514114460001ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0018543","wikidata_id":"Q3563300","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1884,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6zCwPcShvNoVpLrrJtOrjiMTObR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1256}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1927-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
