Fascinated, the child feels the still-warm material, which - whether by a miracle ot the hand of a magician, who knows? - at once changes into a magnificent piece of Chinese porcelain. Presently, from behind the great blue-enamelled trees, there appears a fisherman in his sampan... That's how the story of \"The Nightingale\", told all in music, begins, as the waking dream of a child in the land of Chinese art - and of mobile phones and webcams.","popularity":0.1909,"poster_path":"/rgRqM0vlFDybRbrQoatex8WPmp9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207,"logo_path":"/uskenzq65wJe0cT0D8StQI3hJnO.png","name":"Agat Films & Cie / Ex
