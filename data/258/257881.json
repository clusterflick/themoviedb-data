The mythical condor of Wicked God of Fiery Cloud, Ku Hon-wan, flies the man in distress to safety. The master imparts his adopted son the skill of the Buddha’s Palm. A vicious duel six decades ago with Suen Bik-ling, dubbed the Capricious Flying Ring, left both challengers blind. To pay his debt of gratitude, Lung sets out to obtain the cure—treasure of the golden dragon—and wrestles to save Suen’s granddaughters Kau Yuk-wah and Yuk-kuen who come under the attack of a unicorn while seeking the cure.","popularity":0.229,"poster_path":"/aT6huhE8zdXzfMBl1loGMMLaHDk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83227,"logo_path":null,"name":"Foo Wah Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1964-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buddha's Palm Part 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Ru lai shen zhang 1","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Young Swordsman Lung Kim Fei","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Yu loi sun jeung, Seung jap","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Ru lai shen zhang shang ji","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Buddha's Palm (Part 1)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"如来神掌(上集)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"如来神掌 第一集","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Tso Tat-Wah","original_name":"曹達華","popularity":0.7112,"profile_path":"/4gzcAQywNFgidUJ9DXcuelMIAo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"58245520c3a3684bfe0089c8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1706414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suqiu Yu","original_name":"Suqiu Yu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5824557fc3a3684c010099aa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Lam Fung","original_name":"Patricia Lam Fung","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":"/2l6ugt8Jzfj31fkTqnnNrDFMVzc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"582455959251416251000c39","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1135238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kwan Hoi-San","original_name":"關海山","popularity":0.7509,"profile_path":"/gk80XRJAkrsWLLZfrrx2CESwPfN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"582455a8c3a3684ed6000ddf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lau Kar-Leung","original_name":"劉家良","popularity":0.9409,"profile_path":"/1cKWtvMp0onUAn4OfuclM1693gn.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"582456249251411a480088cc","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298383,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hung Seung-Koon","original_name":"Hung Seung-Koon","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53150527c3a36821d3001973","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1415240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ling Yun","original_name":"Ling Yun","popularity":0.1318,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"582454e49251411a38008dbc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1042643,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Szeto On","original_name":"司徒安","popularity":0.406,"profile_path":"/3tZJ8Tn1syi0aPzPFqIZl6mD35z.jpg","credit_id":"59f009599251416aab00a246","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3290630","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.645,"height":775,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aT6huhE8zdXzfMBl1loGMMLaHDk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":779,"name":"martial arts"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
