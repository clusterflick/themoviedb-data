In the first hour of the lock in, one of the students, Justin, had an unusual “incident” and was “inconsolable.”  It was reported that he calmed down and kept to himself for the remainder of the event.  Two days after the lock in, Justin reportedly broke down to his parents that he experienced something “evil” at the lock in.  He also claimed he captured everything on tape.  After watching the footage, the parents met with church leaders to discuss criminal charges they were considering filing against the church for child endangerment, neglect and torture.","popularity":0.4234,"poster_path":"/gqz1ij9Gzw92flfDiHKT6CNRQ8V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75327,"logo_path":null,"name":"Holy Moly Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It was supposed to be a joke.
