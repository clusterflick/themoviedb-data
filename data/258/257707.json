Robertico, Carmela and Roberto's youngest son, grow up feeling ashamed that his family might not be American enough. He has reached this conclusion by constantly watching American television and forming an opinion as to how Americans really are. Led by his desperation, he literally escapes into an American television sitcom in order to forget about his Cuban past. Not knowing what to do, his family prays to the Virgin Mary to ask for help. When the cultures clash, Robertico has to decide whether he is strong enough to withstand his own self-hatred, and learn not only self-esteem, but how to embrace his Cuban roots.","popularity":1.5231,"poster_path":"/dSP3hoTlZ2FfX5vLPngCTCW4jtK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Things I Forgot to Remember","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Torrent","original_name":"Ana Torrent","popularity":0.4502,"profile_path":"/20fCWHV6CckcpwiSlAplJCSzBZj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Virgin","credit_id":"53136b43c3a3682a22004158","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Merediz","original_name":"Olga Merediz","popularity":0.4628,"profile_path":"/AoU4DdgK26xQN4qZTuzgJpVxhos.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Carmela","credit_id":"5333fa27925141444e0016c4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1303110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Villanueva","original_name":"Larry Villanueva","popularity":0.0595,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Robertico","credit_id":"5333fa46925141444e0016c9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blythe Danner","original_name":"Blythe Danner","popularity":0.6053,"profile_path":"/xIN3nX76b4qN8B32wdoqx053N68.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Bradford","credit_id":"5333fa86925141445a0016e2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Romero","original_name":"Al Romero","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Roberto","credit_id":"5333faa292514144600016fb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rae Dawn Chong","original_name":"Rae Dawn Chong","popularity":1.2375,"profile_path":"/aj9fFFKH3QZX2FSJsj81I4y12M7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"5333fab2925141445d001760","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alicia Borrachero","original_name":"Alicia Borrachero","popularity":0.5416,"profile_path":"/44E8TT0f10IQ9HwQfKYrA79857N.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Juanita","credit_id":"5333fac6925141445d001762","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arantxa de Juan","original_name":"Arantxa de Juan","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/s7HLFksPvmuPFSSZoHFHnu2VJiP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Isabel (as Arancha De Juan)","credit_id":"5333fb16925141445a0016eb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":155835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Hurst","original_name":"Lillian Hurst","popularity":0.2056,"profile_path":"/c3pILLCpdE9SJtDNctZ435Gd9MC.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Consuelo","credit_id":"5333fb4d925141444e0016ee","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enrique Oliver","original_name":"Enrique Oliver","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53136b37c3a36821d300001e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80946,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jaime Pérez Cubero","original_name":"Jaime Pérez Cubero","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f093d53d5ffcb00338540aa","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0203421","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dSP3hoTlZ2FfX5vLPngCTCW4jtK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
