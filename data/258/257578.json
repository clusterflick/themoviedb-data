Often frustrated and desperate, Helen flies into uncontrollable rages and tantrums that terrify her hopeless family. The gifted teacher Annie Sullivan is summoned by the family to help the girl understand the world from which she is isolated, freeing Helen Keller from her internal prison forever. Television remake of the 1962 film which also starred Patty Duke in the role of Helen Keller.","popularity":1.9304,"poster_path":"/8XUMATsAU1ZUjNWi5ZBf6thmUDV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87585,"logo_path":null,"name":"Half-Pint Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":1502,"logo_path":"/ywjcvHUiKxv7cYsestkONF8LieH.png","name":"NBC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1979-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Television adaptation of the William Gibson classic.","title":"The Miracle Worker","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":18,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patty Duke","original_name":"Patty Duke","popularity":0.9234,"profile_path":"/3ZoFi61VbmxvZtyokFG1O3EACYG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Anne Sullivan","credit_id":"53122e6992514110420028d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":142858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Gilbert","original_name":"Melissa Gilbert","popularity":1.3067,"profile_path":"/ZiBlETdDLm8nWKx6N5C624Sn1O.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Helen Keller","credit_id":"53122eea92514110350027a6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Muldaur","original_name":"Diana Muldaur","popularity":0.6254,"profile_path":"/b0whH7c1ZEEsV1WbeDUg2ndLkr7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kate Keller","credit_id":"53122e78925141101f0026d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Siebert","original_name":"Charles Siebert","popularity":0.3039,"profile_path":"/aXSuzalSx3MaAp2svy8kzpqV3qe.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Capt.
