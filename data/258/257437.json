Kudirka was denied asylum and returned to the Soviets, charged with treason, and sentenced to ten years of hard labor. It was later discovered and verified that his mother had been born in Brooklyn and gone to Lithuania at a young age, which meant she was a U. S. citizen. As a result, Kudirka was declared a U. S. citizen and in 1974 released by the Soviets.","popularity":2.3147,"poster_path":"/iNdc6M7RxNpXeLVW6wqiplaRCO4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9223,"logo_path":"/40qzTBM38vokoWhLKurficZ5syV.png","name":"Paramount Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":69888,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Jozak Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Defection of Simas Kudirka","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Arkin","original_name":"Alan Arkin","popularity":1.4574,"profile_path":"/lTMMpkqL0G3WeFNfbtdP5COZEiX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Simas Kudirka","credit_id":"5310b5a1925141101f00110c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Jordan","original_name":"Richard Jordan","popularity":0.9056,"profile_path":"/kmgqmnx8xLhza0ZD0zgQLLautiv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cmdr.
