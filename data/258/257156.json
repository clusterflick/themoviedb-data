There were heated discussions on whether it would be prudent to screen the film during the exhibit. Portabella took the following stance: \"either both films are screened or they don't screen any\" and, finally, both Miro l'Altre and Aidez l'Espagne were shown. The film was made by combining newsreels and film material from the Spanish Civil War with prints by Miró from the series \"Barcelona\" (1939-1944). The film ends with the painter's \"pochoir\" known as Aidez l'Espagne.","popularity":0.4,"poster_path":"/oBaPHEP8vIWRxc3tnqi880ZTQQ1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195504,"logo_path":null,"name":"Colegio de Arquitectos de Cataluña","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"short, politics","title":"Aidez l'Espagne","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pere Portabella","original_name":"Pere Portabella","popularity":0.1089,"profile_path":"/vS6B7Ug4RaZjYEWm7PX645Y7n84.jpg","credit_id":"530d7fdcc3a3685c0c0021c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pere Portabella","original_name":"Pere Portabella","popularity":0.1089,"profile_path":"/vS6B7Ug4RaZjYEWm7PX645Y7n84.jpg","credit_id":"530d7fe6c3a3685bfb0020b2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pere Portabella","original_name":"Pere Portabella","popularity":0.1089,"profile_path":"/vS6B7Ug4RaZjYEWm7PX645Y7n84.jpg","credit_id":"530d8003c3a3685c0c0021cf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pere Portabella","original_name":"Pere Portabella","popularity":0.1089,"profile_path":"/vS6B7Ug4RaZjYEWm7PX645Y7n84.jpg","credit_id":"640a93d19dee5800f6a52d0a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0157298","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oBaPHEP8vIWRxc3tnqi880ZTQQ1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3675,"name":"arts and culture"},{"id":5509,"name":"spanish civil war (1936-39)"},{"id":13151,"name":"drawing"},{"id":165259,"name":"political unrest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
