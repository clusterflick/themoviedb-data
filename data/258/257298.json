Joe's desire for fame changes democracy forever and the voters cheer as ratings soar.  The Joe Show explores how Joe uses media and his role as Sheriff to make himself the most famous law enforcement officer in the world. Racism, sex crimes, illegal immigration, first amendment rights, deaths at the hands of his employees – even Obama’s birth certificate – are all issues Joe faces and spins.  Featuring Larry King, Steven Seagal, Hugh Downs, Ted Nugent, Dan Ariely and Noam Chomsky  A movie that will engage and enlighten both Joe’s detractors and supporters, the Joe Show takes a hard yet balanced look at how democracy can survive when persuading voters becomes more important than protecting them.","popularity":0.9086,"poster_path":"/cpysyvzu9R6faS7Scb6RvECC8FS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20446,"logo_path":"/yeNu5NYbBQERFNBdZg1dwSTxeQC.png","name":"Randy Murray Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Lights.
