This exploration of love and marriage in South Korea looks closely at ancient and present-day rituals, revealing what is old in the new and new in the old. Her inquiry leads us from shamans, temples and priests, to the enchanted maze of 21st-century Seoul, where vendors of medicinal herbs co-exist with high-tech beauty salons for wedding couples and secular marriage palaces. Using film much like a canvas, Ottinger creates a modern fairytale flush with mythological heroes, traditional rites, ancestral symbolism, dreams of eternal love, and a whole lot of Western kitsch. One of her most acclaimed documentaries, it captures the amazing phenomenon of new mega-cities and their contradictory societies caught in a balancing act.","popularity":0.1429,"poster_path":"/aLVMBkWfhWaBicUMOdHjd9R89Qe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Korean Wedding Chest","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1039971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrike Ottinger","original_name":"Ulrike Ottinger","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/4mhoFrgqnqwJCaqTSSgANClrfAL.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65916d99a58902717f963d6c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1039971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrike Ottinger","original_name":"Ulrike Ottinger","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/4mhoFrgqnqwJCaqTSSgANClrfAL.jpg","credit_id":"5310f2c692514110420014c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1674268,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yang Jin-mo","original_name":"양진모","popularity":0.3331,"profile_path":"/zEkYOluedauPisYt2SasnJAX6rl.jpg","credit_id":"65916d594f9a9974be7744c8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1039971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrike Ottinger","original_name":"Ulrike Ottinger","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/4mhoFrgqnqwJCaqTSSgANClrfAL.jpg","credit_id":"65916d8e651fcf5eba8e6264","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":568127,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bettina Blickwede","original_name":"Bettina Blickwede","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65916d74e640d67f40d5c3f7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1039971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrike Ottinger","original_name":"Ulrike Ottinger","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/4mhoFrgqnqwJCaqTSSgANClrfAL.jpg","credit_id":"65916d0c028f147694c5b7ad","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1039971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulrike Ottinger","original_name":"Ulrike Ottinger","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/4mhoFrgqnqwJCaqTSSgANClrfAL.jpg","credit_id":"66ac890078e48634d5cd81bf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4457342,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lee Sunyoung","original_name":"Lee Sunyoung","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ac89155d15116c71631b87","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1381280","wikidata_id":"Q1218788","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1864,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aLVMBkWfhWaBicUMOdHjd9R89Qe.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1242}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
