He began the foundation after observing and living with the deep poverty of the Southern blues artists he befriended and championed.The foundation now helps hundreds of older Southern musicians with everything from financial assistance to tour support. The film travels back to the early artists that were the inspiration for Music Maker, and forward to the current artists carrying on the Southern roots tradition. The film features performances, archival and contemporary, of Music Maker artists on tour and in the studio, as well as interviews with the artists and Duffy on the foundation, music and the blues.","popularity":0.4379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20380,"logo_path":null,"name":"Machipongo Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They told him the blues was dead, so Tim Duffy set out to record the music and ended up with the musicians themselves.","title":"Toot Blues","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Duffy","original_name":"Timothy Duffy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"530bf70ec3a3685c1a00043f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolphus Bell","original_name":"Adolphus Bell","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"530bf873c3a3685bf4000461","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Duffy","original_name":"Denise Duffy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"530bf881c3a3685c20000472","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Essie Mae Brooks","original_name":"Essie Mae Brooks","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"530bf892c3a3685c030004b0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willa Mae Buckner","original_name":"Willa Mae Buckner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"530bf89ec3a3685c0c000463","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1296289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Johnstone","original_name":"Chris Johnstone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530bf72cc3a3685bfb000490","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1296289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Johnstone","original_name":"Chris Johnstone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530bf8c2c3a3685c1a000477","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1296289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Johnstone","original_name":"Chris Johnstone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530bf8d1c3a3685c030004bd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296296,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anna Ferrarie","original_name":"Anna Ferrarie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530bf8e0c3a3685c20000482","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1342963","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5922,"name":"north carolina"},{"id":175506,"name":"blues music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"TOOT BLUES\" trailer","key":"BbWwO2XrU4c","published_at":"2008-05-21T06:44:37.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec72cc3a368544800be6e"}]}}}
