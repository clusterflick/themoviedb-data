Diagnosed with the disease in 1991, Said struggled with his leukemia throughout the 1990s before refraining from interviews due to his increasingly fragile physical state. This interview was the one sole exception to his staunch \"no interview\" policy, and provides fascinating insight into the mind of the man who became Western society's most prominent spokesman for the Palestinian cause.","popularity":0.4698,"poster_path":"/bx98GyHCeV8hQ7HSJCNdcahMfQg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20534,"logo_path":null,"name":"ICA Projects","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edward Said: The Last Interview","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":968931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Said","original_name":"Edward Said","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/wHNc2SVnLtXbBrp4ogvlhYTgUJv.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"531283e8c3a3682a1000337a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297856,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Glass","original_name":"Charles Glass","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"narrator","credit_id":"531283fbc3a36829d3003427","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":586175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Dibb","original_name":"Mike Dibb","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/cCQQSpkwfaG45vQmAnaKd2i28bA.jpg","credit_id":"53128418c3a3682a2200322f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297857,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Don Guttenplan","original_name":"Don Guttenplan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53128459c3a36829a90032c8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1536013,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shelagh Brady","original_name":"Shelagh Brady","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678da1bdd8a5b0d00c434809","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5190576,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philip Dodd","original_name":"Philip Dodd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678da1d49d5e363d1964df58","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5190577,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christopher Cox","original_name":"Christopher Cox","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678da1e9859fb4e6a86e108a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2356778,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dominic McMahon","original_name":"Dominic McMahon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678da1fed8a5b0d00c434820","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0427207","wikidata_id":"Q123536610","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bx98GyHCeV8hQ7HSJCNdcahMfQg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5907,"name":"palestinian-israeli conflict"},{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":198555,"name":"orientalism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
