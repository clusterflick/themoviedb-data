This film captivates by his realistic force. Shot clandestinely using non-professional actors in natural locations, with the camera on his shoulder, Carpita anticipated \"la Nouvelle Vague.\" He is considered the one of the unique French neorealist in film history, the missing link between Jean Renoir’s Toni and Jean-Luc Godard’s Breathless. At the premiere of Rendez-vous of the Docks, cops interrupted the screening and brought the film back to the police station. This film is the longest censored film of the history of French cinema. For 35 years, Paul Carpita thought his film had been destroyed by censorship.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/aV3fve65ivMtOjelfYSlTp5j2sm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137713,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films du Soleil","origin_country":""},{"id":137714,"logo_path":null,"name":"Groupe de Réalisations Cinématographiques de Marseille","origin_country":""},{"id":137715,"logo_path":null,"name":"Profifilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1955-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rendez-vous of the Docks","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Maufray","original_name":"André Maufray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Robert Fournier","credit_id":"530f2bdbc3a368745b000bcc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Manunta","original_name":"Roger Manunta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jean Fournier","credit_id":"530f2be9c3a368445f000752","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanine Moretti","original_name":"Jeanine Moretti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Marcelle","credit_id":"530f2bf4c3a368445f000758","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose Dominiquetti","original_name":"Rose Dominiquetti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"la mère Fournier","credit_id":"530f2bffc3a3687475000be2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Mannac","original_name":"Albert Mannac","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jo, l'ouvrier «jaune»","credit_id":"530f2c0dc3a3687491000bbc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Valde","original_name":"Annie Valde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Simone","credit_id":"530f2c17c3a36874ca000b3e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Pasquini","original_name":"Georges Pasquini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Toine","credit_id":"530f2c24c3a3687475000bed","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louisette Cavolino","original_name":"Louisette Cavolino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"la femme de Toine","credit_id":"530f2c31c3a36874af000b1b","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Carpita","original_name":"Paul Carpita","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530f2babc3a368749f000abd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297009,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Carpita","original_name":"Paul Carpita","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530f2bbcc3a3687491000ba9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297010,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"André Maufray","original_name":"André Maufray","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530f2bcbc3a368745b000bc7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0048550","wikidata_id":"Q2628938","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z9rAcsiymNjUFkCdieTemYQDDE7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3839}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1049,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aV3fve65ivMtOjelfYSlTp5j2sm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":699}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: French Wikipedia","release_date":"1955-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
