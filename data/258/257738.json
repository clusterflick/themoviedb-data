Kate Sorin never imagined how volunteering herself as \"base citizen\" for Project Shell would determine her fate. The UNCORP claimed that the creation of the cyber-clones would be the bridge to a free and equal society, without thinking that their human nature would fight against the role they were created for: to be slaves.  Soon began the riots. The clones started a rebellion, trying to escape using any means. To control outbreaks of violence and retrieve escaped units the UNCORP created a specialized police unit, the CHD (Clone Hunter Division).  The individual 0258 escaped impersonating Kate, but everything went wrong and she saw herself forced to kidnap KateÂ´s daughter to survive, who died in the crossfire. Since that moment, Kate joined the CHD with a single goal, to find 0258 and avenge the death of his daughter.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Project Shell","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Clone Hunter Division","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Witt","original_name":"Sarah Witt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Kate Sorin","credit_id":"5313940992514110130063b3","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2418776","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
