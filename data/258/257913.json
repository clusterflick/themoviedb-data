Except that Emil doesn’t see this as punishment – on the contrary: he locks the door from inside so that he can continue undisturbed to carve another of his wooden figures, of which he has a whole collection. His little sister Ida also wants to sit inside the shed, but she’s too well-behaved.  This new adaptation of Astrid Lindgren’s beloved tales from her book ‘Emil of Lönneberga’ portrays the sunny side of life in the country at the beginning of the twentieth century.","popularity":0.5241,"poster_path":"/6PRyWDKsxH30aLgHVdmSbonpAzk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2669,"logo_path":"/xuSvgLUZJyrY4IO1jBpmlqpHqyc.png","name":"Filmlance
