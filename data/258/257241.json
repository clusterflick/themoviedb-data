However, as his on-air alias ‘Danger Dave,’ the host of “Gay Talk,” he’s poised, witty, and every listener’s best friend. His sister, Kate, a thrice divorced banker has a yen for Schumann and cats. Though successful, the siblings suffer from a secret, yet vast, sense of inadequacy. Kate decides to adopt and asks David to be a father figure. David gawkily romances his coworker. Past and present intertwine to tell the story of a man learning to love and accept himself.","popularity":0.8564,"poster_path":"/mCIt2nQTmZPsfGfmnz0RFoXK7TJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132541,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brave Lad
