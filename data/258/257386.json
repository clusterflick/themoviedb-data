Events unfold to the amplified sounds of grinding, pouring and stirring.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Be Mother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Pucill","original_name":"Sarah Pucill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530fe2fe9251410ff100048c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1999325","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
