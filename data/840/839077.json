A purely visual and musical voyage through the challenges between two people – or the contrasts within each and everyone of us. The abstract artistic expression of both sound and picture has an ambiguity which allows for individual interpretations and experiences. The film consists of directly animated drawings and sequences joined in a “chain of mixes”. It is a visual poem where Sidsel Endresens’s music plays key role. Sidsel Endresen is one of Norway’s most prominent jazz performers and composers. She also makes music for dance, theater and film.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/lhdCe6U9gHj2lnrZMVKaNN8y8Ax.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Expedition","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3120818,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Runi Langum","original_name":"Runi Langum","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c2801e5ab81a005667b989","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3120821,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kjersti Martinsen","original_name":"Kjersti Martinsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c280565ab81a0029c0900d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3119810,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Runi Langum","original_name":"Runi Langum","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c2800e07faa200584360cd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3119810,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Runi Langum","original_name":"Runi Langum","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c280041c6aa7007ac49efa","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1724189,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Nina Bergström","original_name":"Nina Bergström","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c2804c1c6aa700595323d6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3120820,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sidsel Endresen","original_name":"Sidsel Endresen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c2802b1277780056949050","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914076,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Reidar Skår","original_name":"Reidar Skår","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c280351ac2920076adf069","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lhdCe6U9gHj2lnrZMVKaNN8y8Ax.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"no","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Expedition","key":"64487320","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2013-04-21T11:56:41.000Z","id":"60c27f955ab81a003f8ca04c"}]}}}
