We follow him on his tour with his band, Firewind, but also on his solo projects. With him and his colleagues, we travel into the magical world of hard rock, where many taboos, social and other issues are being analyzed, while at the same time a very special personality is revealed. This course of 20 years was not paved with rose petals. It was a hard road through persecution, sweat, hunger and immigration, until the final vindication of his close collaboration with Ozzy Osbourne.","popularity":0.054,"poster_path":"/jNZzJFAUlSzqKePX3mq0eN1h6dk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2018-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gus G.: Life Through Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gus G.","original_name":"Gus G.","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60c283a3f18ce7002974cc9f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2903047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thanasis Tsaousopoulos","original_name":"Θανάσης Τσαουσόπουλος","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/4yJXeYW77n5hMYf0BvaHU7Z7dIe.jpg","credit_id":"60c28468d34eb3002a3bb32e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3120860,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yannis Serpanos","original_name":"Yannis Serpanos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c2849905a533006da49ca7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3013281,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michalis Dimitrakakos","original_name":"Michalis Dimitrakakos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c284b4c51acd0079c47e09","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3120859,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Konstantinos Adam","original_name":"Konstantinos Adam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c2848907faa200584367c8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2903047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thanasis Tsaousopoulos","original_name":"Θανάσης Τσαουσόπουλος","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/4yJXeYW77n5hMYf0BvaHU7Z7dIe.jpg","credit_id":"60c284605f4b7300708a6de0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1277476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vasilis Vasilakis","original_name":"Βασίλης Βασιλάκης","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/ppmrULtPiKE5KY9wsE3bKvHQ6Fa.jpg","credit_id":"60c2847b713ed400582065b1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2648954,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nikos Paliatsoudis","original_name":"Nikos Paliatsoudis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c2849105a533006da49c8f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2903047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thanasis Tsaousopoulos","original_name":"Θανάσης Τσαουσόπουλος","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/4yJXeYW77n5hMYf0BvaHU7Z7dIe.jpg","credit_id":"60c283be663b870058fef84e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gus G.","original_name":"Gus G.","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c284a847721500402343a0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3120858,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kostas Ioakimidis","original_name":"Kostas Ioakimidis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c28471663b87006fc0854b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12117816","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jNZzJFAUlSzqKePX3mq0eN1h6dk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"20th Thessaloniki Documentary Festival","release_date":"2018-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
