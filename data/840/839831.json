There, in this uncanny and at times surreal setting, he meets elusive and resilient Hannah, the only female member of a toxic 'family' of criminals. Jay's presence disrupts the fragile alliances between occultist boss Seow, sociopathic thug Alan and disillusioned henchman Patrick. Jay and Hannah plan their escape with Seow's money but find themselves caught in an endless night of seduction, deadly violence, and betrayal. And when the sun comes up, it won't be over. 'Malam' plunges into a humid, seething underworld of sexual jealousy, perverse power struggles and Southeast Asian folklore. It is a contemporary and atmospheric thriller about the chance for hope in a deeply corrupted world.","popularity":0.072,"poster_path":"/7ja8VuJt3TpVYMhSoFFJT2mWNbu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155788,"logo_path":"/qBIdVjhIYKbmGfOn173OKOWmk9M.png","name":"M'GO Films","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2021-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"},{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malam","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3123231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Goh","original_name":"Jean Goh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hannah","credit_id":"60c58b4348333a002a396963","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3123232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sijia Goh","original_name":"Sijia Goh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Hannah","credit_id":"60c58b4b944a57006eb2575f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3123233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vishnu Krishnan","original_name":"Vishnu Krishnan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/n0OpB9KVw9FIfHyj0al9gyEwHa7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jay","credit_id":"60c58b697dfda60046b47042","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3123234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Wu Luoyi","original_name":"Louis Wu Luoyi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Alan","credit_id":"60c58b7618864b00297306a3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3123235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Pio Pereira","original_name":"Sebastian Pio Pereira","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Patrick","credit_id":"60c58b7eeea34d006f0aaa31","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3123236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Say Ping Yap","original_name":"Say Ping Yap","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Seow","credit_id":"60c58b8799259c002a147ee2","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2331468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonard Yip","original_name":"Leonard Yip","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c58ae67dfda6007fc91b11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3123229,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Slater","original_name":"Ben Slater","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c58b30eea34d002a66fd8e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1359661,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tim Chen","original_name":"Tim Chen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e13f7fb686b9005e494025","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3145246,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Clare Chao","original_name":"Clare Chao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e13f91bdd568005e5bd8f0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3145247,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Savina Nicolini","original_name":"Savina Nicolini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e13fa2d0b434007f0a3fbb","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14304050","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1838,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ja8VuJt3TpVYMhSoFFJT2mWNbu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1313}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MALAM Trailer","key":"xE79i0v9l6Y","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-06-02T15:53:36.000Z","id":"60c58ffc7a97ab0070127dd4"}]}}}
