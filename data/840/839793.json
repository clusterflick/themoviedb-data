More than 100 inches of rainfall each year sustain this lush environment, where some of the most fascinating examples of natural adaptation can be found. Journey to the dense rain forests of Costa Rica and watch as leaf-cutting ants carry sections of leaves many times their weight to underground fungus gardens, a basilisk lizard walks on water, and howler monkeys bask in the sun. Fascinating and thought-provoking, this film is an eloquent warning of the natural wonders we stand to lose on a world scale if human encroachment of the world's rain forests continues.","popularity":0.2807,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Geographic's Rain Forest","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Kiley","original_name":"Richard Kiley","popularity":0.7628,"profile_path":"/1s24x1TsT8DxBKGksTeeaCmKYvU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"60c554f35a46900029fd1d18","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1211124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carol Hughes","original_name":"Carol Hughes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c5540a5a4690004027dc35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3123105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Hughes","original_name":"David Hughes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c5542beea34d006f0a49c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1211124,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carol Hughes","original_name":"Carol Hughes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671fa2d82685cb6563c15439","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
