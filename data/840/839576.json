Marshall began his filming in 1951 and in the 1980s became an activist helping the Ju/’hoansi fight for their land and water rights. Marshall produced over 20 films on the Ju’/hoansi beginning with The Hunters (1957) and culminating with A Kalahari Family (2003).  The project began as an article Alice Apley and I wrote shortly after John’s death and then it evolved into a series of video interviews. Interviewees include: Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, Robert Gordon, Alexandra Eliot Marshall, Cynthia Close, Sandeep Ray, Karma Foley, Jayasinhji (Bapa) Jhala, and Rakhi Jhala.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remembering John Marshall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3122514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alice Apley","original_name":"Alice Apley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c491f1a76ac50040f32cb6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3122515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Tamés","original_name":"David Tamés","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c49228d04d1a003f071d5a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3122514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alice Apley","original_name":"Alice Apley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c491dfc3514c003f1ec1b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3122515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Tamés","original_name":"David Tamés","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c4921618864b002971930f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
