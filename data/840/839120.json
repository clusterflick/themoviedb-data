The eldest one, Emmy, is a beautiful and pure young girl of seventeen, who tentatively believes she has a calling to the religious life. The second child, Bertrand, aged fifteen, has been sent to England for an exchange holiday with a young English boy, Harry Fanning, and when the play opens, the French children are excitedly awaiting his arrival. Also living with the family is a French governess, and a tutor, Blaise Lebel. Lebel has a sombre power over the family, and it is the ‘intrusion’ of Harry that sets in motion in him a wave of resentment and fear.","popularity":0.2501,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1959-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asmodée","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marius Goring","original_name":"Marius Goring","popularity":0.2301,"profile_path":"/tBlkEduzwxRGP7Jq5NIGOy2O4E4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Blaise Lebel","credit_id":"60c2b1f405a5330057c043d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":133247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Cherry","original_name":"Helen Cherry","popularity":0.1429,"profile_path":"/dG9IbH5lsg4RIYJ3GDTcfuBIQfc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marcelle de Barthas","credit_id":"60c2b21f713ed400299fee9c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2690395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Buck","original_name":"Pamela Buck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Emmanuele","credit_id":"60c2b247663b870040df6660","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1234486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maureen Pryor","original_name":"Maureen Pryor","popularity":0.0669,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mademoiselle","credit_id":"60c2b26739a45d007766586d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":575813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bown","original_name":"John Bown","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Harry Fanning","credit_id":"60c2b2875f4b730042e828c6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Fleming","original_name":"Ian Fleming","popularity":0.1362,"profile_path":"/q6Z6rOz3PdLJ1Y3H719hK7wnwrd.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Curé","credit_id":"60c2b2a4c1ffbd0050782d80","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3120994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Victor","original_name":"Frederick Victor","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Jacques","credit_id":"60c2b2c25ab81a0029c0da57","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronnie Raymond","original_name":"Ronnie Raymond","popularity":0.0695,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jean","credit_id":"60c2b2dd127778005694d41e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1626293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Waveney Lee","original_name":"Waveney Lee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Anne","credit_id":"60c2b2f9c51acd00280e148d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2021724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Latimer","original_name":"Max Latimer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Chauffeur","credit_id":"60c2b3198eda870029ae168a","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1049252,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"François Mauriac","original_name":"François Mauriac","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c2b3a2c1ffbd0050782fa6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":566947,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Basil Bartlett","original_name":"Basil Bartlett","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c2b3c0477215005713fd09","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1813135,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Richard Wilmot","original_name":"Richard Wilmot","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c2b35f07291c003f131e0b","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2842010,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Harold Clayton","original_name":"Harold Clayton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c2b337960cde0040f50536","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1670340","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1959-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
