It is a shared and solidary project, which shapes a story in which the daily duties and urgencies acquire an extreme political and poetic relevance. In short, and from our perspective as spectators, we are once again questioned about the indissoluble condition of the intimate and personal in the political sphere.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1YOS8NYB0SFgFSssjlhCy1odtX1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Earth of the Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3121697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paloma Polo","original_name":"Paloma Polo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c394b1a76ac50058004efb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3121697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paloma Polo","original_name":"Paloma Polo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c394c38c31590076bb514f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1557929,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Octavio Iturbe","original_name":"Octavio Iturbe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c394d393828e0040b052ef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3121697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paloma Polo","original_name":"Paloma Polo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c394b9ac617c0027dfb7c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tVafOeyuhQQLVV6aaKbMc0UnoD0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":3,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1949,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1YOS8NYB0SFgFSssjlhCy1odtX1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
