One day, he and his friend (Kadhal Sugumar) come across a drug dealer which lands them in trouble. What was supposed to be a thriller then becomes a series of unengaging sequences, thanks to underdeveloped characters and low production values. The core plot surrounding astrology was left unexplored after a point. With an aimless screenplay, unnecessary songs, weak humour, ineffective twists and strictly okayish performances from the two lead characters, Thiruvalar Panchankam becomes a tedious affair.","popularity":0.1544,"poster_path":"/f1mUIuF6rOwHnK2bUJ5WuVZTXGQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alar studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2020-12-11","revenue":1,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thiruvalar Panchankam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ananth Nag","original_name":"Ananth Nag","popularity":0.2143,"profile_path":"/gGw4z4AW3qNPzefiiRN9Mty9zp9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60c58fc948333a0057565a18","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":586659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kadhal Sukumar","original_name":"Kadhal Sukumar","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/5xuvE8vgXOk2s75AkTwDyVHpsOd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60c58fdec3514c003f208f79","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":503842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aadukalam Naren","original_name":"Adukalam Naren","popularity":0.3059,"profile_path":"/w3a6Qwh6pbnU2j7vJlzpyc2r7Dw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Police Official","credit_id":"60c58ff5a76ac5006d9f2a99","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Urvashi","original_name":"Urvashi","popularity":0.4662,"profile_path":"/s5q8iDWeZ8lVBtr87kBXS0S326H.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Doctor","credit_id":"60c59004d04d1a003f088fc3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3123249,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kasi Vishva","original_name":"Kasi Vishva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c5908eeea34d0058e8e3a3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3123248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malarvizhi Natesan","original_name":"Malarvizhi Natesan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c59025f5cb2100401c86cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1657726,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"JV","original_name":"JV","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c590547a97ab0042b426a5","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":896,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f1mUIuF6rOwHnK2bUJ5WuVZTXGQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ta","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
