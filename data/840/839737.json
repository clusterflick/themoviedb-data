Unbeknownst to them, something far more sinister guides the cult, and plots the destruction of Annistiem. Warriors, miscreants, and opportunists venture forth into the wood to slay the degenerate creatures, each having their own reasons and rationale. Some for gold, some for purity, and some for the hunt. But deep in the forest, only the trust of an ally, and the cold steel of sword and axe can save oneself from the terrors that lurk within.","popularity":0.5439,"poster_path":"/4fl28PoAXFTaIVcziwTh3ByRTWZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138449,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmhub","origin_country":""},{"id":155771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Cloud Consort","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The flower withers.","title":"Spriggan","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Spriggan: An Ironlands Tale","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Spriggan: A Tale From the Ironlands","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3122897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Cascio","original_name":"Jonathan Cascio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Magistrate","credit_id":"60c51ccf944a57002a8e583c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3122899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Chase","original_name":"Samuel Chase","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Goblin","credit_id":"60c51ce018864b002972494e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3122900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacquelynne Faith","original_name":"Jacquelynne Faith","popularity":0.0754,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bastilla / The Spriggan","credit_id":"60c51d06a284eb0040690482","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3122902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffery Frame","original_name":"Jeffery Frame","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Innkeeper","credit_id":"60c51d3818864b0029724a1c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2353351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Gill","original_name":"Robert Gill","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ivarkall the Ranger","credit_id":"60c51d6f5a46900058e32608","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3122908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angus W.
