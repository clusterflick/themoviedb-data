Independently owned coffee shops filled up with academics and intellectuals. A top-grade record store served as the premier destination for local musicologists. Bars and clubs buzzed with live music, flowing taps and warm bodies. And then, almost seemingly overnight, it all just - disappeared. By the turn of the century, the coffeehouses and record stores had shuttered, the art galleries moved downtown, and the street scene became a distant memory. Through archival footage and interviews with business owners, journalists, musicians, artists and scenesters from that era, Parkway of Broken Dreams tells the story of how alternative culture on Maryland Parkway was born, thrived, and, eventually, faded away.","popularity":0.2691,"poster_path":"/xBY0ef51xFO1UPrOmFPqT6ITmil.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155732,"logo_path":null,"name":"PKWY Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beyond The Strip.
