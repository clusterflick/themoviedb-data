An excavation into Scotland’s Black history, this work began in 2020, which incidentally was the ‘Year of Scottish Coasts and Waters’. The work asks: what can we learn from water? Fluidity, impermanence, ease of movement, care, methods of listening, tenderness – these are some possible answers. We can liquify ourselves, and look to water to guide us, provide answers, or inspire questions. Umbilic is an offering; it is forever incomplete.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Umbilic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3248141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natasha Thembiso Ruwona","original_name":"Natasha Thembiso Ruwona","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61505abf1c635b008f77fe1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
