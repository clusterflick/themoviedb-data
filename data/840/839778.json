The gig was the culmination of a months retrospective celebrating the music, films and words of Skids front-man Richard Jobson. A sold out gig was caught on film by the team Jobson uses to shoot his movies. The result is a high energy performance that captures everything that was great about one of the best loved bands to come out of the Punk/New wave era. The film is inter-cut with an interview with Jobson on stage by crime novelist Ian Rankin.","popularity":0.0491,"poster_path":"/f7fnn3AjaB2MZZQxE4lbaPnJdVA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skids Live 2010","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Jobson","original_name":"Richard Jobson","popularity":0.104,"profile_path":"/f835D2fduR12d5wpgm4IeAfEwkv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60c53c7599259c00596da704","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3123039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Simpson","original_name":"Bill Simpson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60c53c9799259c00791e8d65","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3123042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Baillie","original_name":"Mike Baillie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60c53cad7dfda60046b3e637","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1941156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Watson","original_name":"Bruce Watson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60c53cbf99259c0041135a6e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3123047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Watson","original_name":"Jamie Watson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60c53ce5eea34d002a666f57","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Jobson","original_name":"Richard Jobson","popularity":0.104,"profile_path":"/f835D2fduR12d5wpgm4IeAfEwkv.jpg","credit_id":"60c53c355a46900058e34ff0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Jobson","original_name":"Richard Jobson","popularity":0.104,"profile_path":"/f835D2fduR12d5wpgm4IeAfEwkv.jpg","credit_id":"60c53c2048333a002a38e11e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1781027","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2153,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f7fnn3AjaB2MZZQxE4lbaPnJdVA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1436}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
