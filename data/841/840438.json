After a halfhearted attempt to find a babysitter, Rachel and Paul go off to a party leaving Rose in her own care in a remote and rambling old house. She goes to bed after checking house and garden with her flashlight and not succeeding in finding her pet. When the front door bangs shut a couple of times and she hears footsteps, Rose grabs her hockey stick and hides in the closet. Someone is definitely in the house. Rose times her leap from the closet and the swing of her stick perfectly: pow! Has she saved herself? Or does fate have more in store?","popularity":0.0741,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":59412,"logo_path":null,"name":"Entermorfic Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1995-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She thought she could be on her own for one evening...","title":"Darkling","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonie Kamerling","original_name":"Antonie Kamerling","popularity":0.2181,"profile_path":"/zgFQb4ryjB1nFY9up5AnfARpREU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"60c7968eb6c2640058b065ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":114755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isa Hoes","original_name":"Isa Hoes","popularity":0.3084,"profile_path":"/7h4wgjTCfyCRNNjbcqg8uslfyGo.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rebecca","credit_id":"60c7969948333a00575843e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3124938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tess Löwenhardt","original_name":"Tess Löwenhardt","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Rose","credit_id":"60c796c7b6c2640058b065e0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52169,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pieter Kuijpers","original_name":"Pieter Kuijpers","popularity":0.0857,"profile_path":"/gf4kBCMZXAFsQQRiKYHfPcrprjR.jpg","credit_id":"60c796dcc390c50079d8fe60","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52169,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pieter Kuijpers","original_name":"Pieter Kuijpers","popularity":0.0857,"profile_path":"/gf4kBCMZXAFsQQRiKYHfPcrprjR.jpg","credit_id":"60c796e3b6c264002ae4addc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0112805","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"1995-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
