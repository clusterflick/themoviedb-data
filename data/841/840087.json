In addition to scenes evidently shot before and after the Nihon Genyasai Festival in Sanrizuka, it features time-lapse sequences showing abandoned houses and construction equipment leveling requisitioned land.  “The footage was filmed in Narita. Because this land had been seized, I became conscious of the intensity of my own inner landscape. My time-lapse filming of the landscape was intended for use in an animation-as-documentary.”","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/wBvVoOdFJGeJtAVPSO4qaszht23.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Extinction of Landscape","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Fūkei no shimetsu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205562,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nobuhiro Aihara","original_name":"相原信洋","popularity":0.0848,"profile_path":"/1etjge0BIdAWpDPmyvayZabecT6.jpg","credit_id":"60c6650b988afd00291bf512","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":802,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qapeuyrmdB1k5b5RUEW5cfvRMJt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1426},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":804,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rgtPMyFTZRJuX291Xs9bbtBj9ic.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1430},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":804,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eoqUAvRs70DfcQ8idKOwUvahTZj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1430},{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":807,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dL3BLKn5SuT1Klseky2nvKu8P7c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1433},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":803,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iMRhIZQrwD7IwELxfOCzAQpvWcT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1428},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":802,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8hnuZH6cQaO7T1PlR9jLvpeVBBW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1426},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":804,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ltiYwlCQCpy42cCzFQeO6JJBv4P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1430}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wBvVoOdFJGeJtAVPSO4qaszht23.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uGi1cGMpPKovNIihxRM3mzKeQaa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
