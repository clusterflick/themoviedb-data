Through a collage of animations, archival footage and a counterpoint sound montage, Ulive attacks traditional left-wing and right-wing politics and exposes the contradictions of a pillar of national identity: Uruguay's famous democracy. Note that we are in 1960 and while the voice over presents Montevideo as \"a small agitated city\", the images show a tense scenario with social protests and a politicized urban space with the presence of mounted police.","popularity":0.0536,"poster_path":"/1L122ctnaFbDRArLzRV4MuF1iQd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Como el Uruguay no hay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1041681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ugo Ulive","original_name":"Ugo Ulive","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/j3tb8Mu2uFmNdqs7wPZDnQbuxu7.jpg","credit_id":"60c890283679a10078cbbb50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1419,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1L122ctnaFbDRArLzRV4MuF1iQd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":946}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
