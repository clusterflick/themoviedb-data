The film shadows two clashing perspectives both of which are searching for safety in their own communities and these perspectives blend testimonies of trauma and manifestos of power. By using poetic documentation, the director acknowledges that there are more than two sides to every story and intertwines these sentiments, embodiments and experiences into one journey to understand what is happening behind the doors of communities the other hasn’t experienced.","popularity":0.3063,"poster_path":"/3sz6yD9Q0YJRaHBR2Qouy9JXFDx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other Side of Fear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1440515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahmed Fouad Ragab","original_name":"Ahmed Fouad Ragab","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ltnhElO4w3e8GoBxK2NEEFXMqeI.jpg","credit_id":"60c7ad0c9974ee00405b7f12","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1440515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahmed Fouad Ragab","original_name":"Ahmed Fouad Ragab","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ltnhElO4w3e8GoBxK2NEEFXMqeI.jpg","credit_id":"60c7ad573679a1003f8b9a93","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3125028,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Karl Robert Vain","original_name":"Karl Robert Vain","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c7aca03679a100585c9019","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3125029,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ardi Ossaar","original_name":"Ardi Ossaar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c7acbd8e8702006d39f2c5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3125031,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Soha Mohsen","original_name":"Soha Mohsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c7ad6499259c005970576a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1440515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahmed Fouad Ragab","original_name":"Ahmed Fouad Ragab","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ltnhElO4w3e8GoBxK2NEEFXMqeI.jpg","credit_id":"60c7acf0b6c2640058b0848e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3125028,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Karl Robert Vain","original_name":"Karl Robert Vain","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c7ad240372640041eba9b2","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3125029,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ardi Ossaar","original_name":"Ardi Ossaar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c7ad34d132d600416b5493","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1440515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahmed Fouad Ragab","original_name":"Ahmed Fouad Ragab","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ltnhElO4w3e8GoBxK2NEEFXMqeI.jpg","credit_id":"60c7ac878e870200562912dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4038074","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/k3ufjX8Ik2mKB8B03FFkRCaPYbn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2756,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3sz6yD9Q0YJRaHBR2Qouy9JXFDx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1929}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10360,"name":"prejudice"},{"id":13073,"name":"fear"},{"id":194451,"name":"social issues"},{"id":309524,"name":"questões sociais"},{"id":309525,"name":"preconceito"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Pillusion Film Festival","release_date":"2022-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Other Side of Fear (2020)  - Teaser Trailer - A film by Ahmed Fouad Ragab","key":"kaq5AaMCtXA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2020-11-09T17:03:02.000Z","id":"60c7ade7ab1bc7002cd9bbd1"}]}}}
