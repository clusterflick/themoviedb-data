Many of the youngest died on the way, others died later from starvation, disease and over work in the Soviet camps. Some of the deported children survived and returned to Latvia, others remained in Siberia for their whole lives. Dzintra Geka's latest documentary \"Road to Siberia, 1941\" is an emotional account about those deportees who grew up in Siberia, far from their homeland.","popularity":0.0627,"poster_path":"/iHhmUuGbeRtffHKylxvxk9FMvPr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2021-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Road to Siberia, 1941","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2191240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","original_name":"Dzintra Geka-Vaska","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xkoDazTXGrxNWMU2XPfTyXpisOg.jpg","credit_id":"60c76ddd8e8702005628ccaf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2333858,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aivars Lubānietis","original_name":"Aivars Lubānietis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c76ded8e8702003fc207e7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1732297,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pēteris Vasks","original_name":"Pēteris Vasks","popularity":0.0761,"profile_path":"/sydsEChqbQifMFNRgDai2U58a3R.jpg","credit_id":"60c76dfdab1bc700437b7d2d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2913587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valdis Lūriņš","original_name":"Valdis Lūriņš","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c76e155b4fed00425d0204","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":867,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iHhmUuGbeRtffHKylxvxk9FMvPr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":578}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
