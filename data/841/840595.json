It was the second most important Roman port in the western Mediterranean and the town was one of the most important commercial hubs between the colonies and the Roman Empire, thus the town could boast a size rivaling that of the city that had established it: Rome itself. Paradoxically, the town that distinguished itself for its impressive architecture, today shows no more signs of it: neither temples, arenas, nor theaters. Far less significant Roman towns like Nîmes or Arles are full of ancient sites. Narbonne today is a tranquil town in Occitania","popularity":0.6181,"poster_path":"/mVPL3FkrDoSWSZymP5HoVRRjWhJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2668,"logo_path":"/wXmehIpEfAaJk7eU6GpBERpK3m1.png","name":"MC4","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Narbonne: The Second Rome","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Narbonne.
