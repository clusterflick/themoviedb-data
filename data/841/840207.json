Prior to filming the SOUND OF ONE, Bartlett studied dance as a student enrolled at the Inner Research Institute. His teacher was Martin Inn. This student-teacher relationship evolved into a collaboration in which Barlett and Inn scripted a summer workshop course entitled The Application of T'si Chi Ch'uan to the Art of Filmmaking. SOUND OF ONE is the fruit of that program, a melding of the two disciplines. SOUND OF ONE records the short form of the T'ai Chi dance as a solo figure moves through changing landscapes – oceanside to forest to volcano peak – to represent the five elements: water, wood, fire, air and metal.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":"/iuM3RSnUTdcSyvATIPS3oJeMXpF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sound of One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094668,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Bartlett","original_name":"Scott Bartlett","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c6e0f2b6c2640058afb50e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iuM3RSnUTdcSyvATIPS3oJeMXpF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ap02hXx8yUjAlbAQRniLffSpUol.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
