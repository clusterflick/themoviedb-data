Basketball is being played for the fans and can't be enjoyed without the atmosphere created by the fans. The film follows different basketball supporters simultaneously - locally well known actors in a bar, parents of the players in the arena, random people near the big screens in the main square, veteran basketball experts at their homes, injured players following the games from their rehabilitation centre and many others. EuroBasket 2015 was a unique situation for three post-soviet neighboring countries - the Baltic states, as they were drawn into the same group in the preliminary round and everyone could witness the unique unity between these friendly countries.","popularity":0.0793,"poster_path":"/mhyCY4S2NFQIaIpcUI3Rv0VNLv8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112129,"logo_path":null,"name":"KULTFILMA","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2016-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"6th Player","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","title":"Sestais spēlētājs","type":"Alternative spelling"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"6-ой игрок","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"United Kingdom","title":"The Sixth Player","type":"Alternative spelling"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2231045,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pēteris Pāss","original_name":"Pēteris Pāss","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c9273899259c002a17d570","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2192057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzintars Dreibergs","original_name":"Dzintars Dreibergs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/9hM742w8KgA3vSCitjEfM7wkzSP.jpg","credit_id":"60c926b1ca8354002995e90e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2889449,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Richards Olmanis","original_name":"Richards Olmanis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c926cbb0ba7e006ea3b141","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2950068,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Krista Sondore","original_name":"Krista Sondore","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c926e73679a10078cc6d9a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2192057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dzintars Dreibergs","original_name":"Dzintars Dreibergs","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/9hM742w8KgA3vSCitjEfM7wkzSP.jpg","credit_id":"60c92715b0ba7e003f5d2dec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2889449,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Richards Olmanis","original_name":"Richards Olmanis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c9275112197e0057c2764b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6006672","wikidata_id":"Q27043795","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mhyCY4S2NFQIaIpcUI3Rv0VNLv8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
