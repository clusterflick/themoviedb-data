However, behind this mask are two troubled paths where emotions are experienced on the surface. During a Sunday walk in Dunham, Alex decides to broadcast the chaos on Facebook Live. When he suddenly gets out of the car, he finds himself alone in a row in the countryside. The more he runs, the more his past catches up with him. Through these intertwined stories, we encounter different aspects of life, from marital problems to family troubles, from ego overload to psychological disorders, from ephemeral love affairs to endless breakups.
