A young governess arrives at an old house in the country to look after two orphans. What unfolds is a chilling tale as she experiences strange ghostly encounters with some of the previous occupants of the house and finds herself engaged in a battle to protect the children’s souls from evil.  Myfanwy Piper’s libretto of Henry James’s famous short story leaves much to our imagination and Britten’s score is haunting, terrifying and brilliant.  Shot on location at Wilton's Music Hall, London, the whole space of the venue, not just the stage, is used to tell the story.","popularity":0.2881,"poster_path":"/gAJX2JkpQsoooS19ypO1DPc6eVR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":210733,"logo_path":null,"name":"OperaGlass Works","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Benjamin Britten’s opera, a chilling tale of a young governess at a country house, where ghostly encounters find her in a battle to save her wards from evil.","title":"The Turn of the Screw - OperaGlass Works","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3125751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Murray","original_name":"Robert Murray","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Quint","credit_id":"60c8b9b899259c0059713eeb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3125752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhian Lois","original_name":"Rhian Lois","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Governess","credit_id":"60c8b9d33679a10078cbe14c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Jemison","original_name":"Leo Jemison","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Miles","credit_id":"6526798f0cb33516fec5bef2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1984426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesca Chiejina","original_name":"Francesca Chiejina","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Miss Jessel","credit_id":"652679ecd399e600addac60c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4315762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gwynethann Rand","original_name":"Gwynethann Rand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Grose","credit_id":"65267a4d81383100c489744f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4315764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alys Mererid Roberts","original_name":"Alys Mererid Roberts","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Flora","credit_id":"65267a7ccedac400ace473a0","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Selina Cadell","original_name":"Selina Cadell","popularity":0.7014,"profile_path":"/2xuwmYuSmWD7jGAC7vq8wVDKOq1.jpg","credit_id":"65267942ea84c700aef096c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1812582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominic Best","original_name":"Dominic Best","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6526794fcedac4013fab9dd2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39013,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henry James","original_name":"Henry James","popularity":0.2664,"profile_path":"/gzLNPzEO8kfnvqFzU9bDolIoSvp.jpg","credit_id":"652679610cb33516fec5bedb","department":"Writing","job":"Short Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13980040","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4WrAsxs6iJ1daKQelbHhw8Oxw6b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1451,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gAJX2JkpQsoooS19ypO1DPc6eVR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1032}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
