An alternation of power that did not speak its name opened the doors of power to a reforming president. Abortion, divorce by mutual consent, lowering the age of majority to 18 - in less than two years, the youngest President of the Republic - at the time - carried out reforms with a vengeance, without a united majority in Parliament, before failing in the economic sphere and losing the battle against unemployment. At the age of 90, the former President of the Republic has agreed to look back on these years and gives us a valuable account of his time in power.","popularity":0.2911,"poster_path":"/t8byyKrCgt1qP2ELCmqet16v51U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90881,"logo_path":"/sRtQRyhTAPzsw0wUmnrpkXPQEuz.png","name":"Public
