We accompany four indigenous people who deal with it in different ways. Pirin is the last village in Europe where a dragon still exists. Georgi is Pirin’s mayor and tries to fight against its extinction – he has the dream to turn the village into a tourist attraction. Maria is widowed and still lives together with her over 40 year old son. They even share a room, but he should find a wife and give birth to children as soon as possible. Iliya is a shepherd and an alcoholic. He can no longer bear the decay of the village and has decided to live in the forest, surrounded by goats and sheep, without electricity and running water. The dragon named Gincho is on everyone’s lips and is feared and honoured by the inhabitants of Pirin.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/bwxwgMV2LZRfqhYu5X3RsIMvM4p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151483,"logo_path":"/rCwpsCQCvUqWZXdPXMHaWTPtbBq.png","name":"Wood Water Films","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mayor, Shepherd, Widow, Dragon","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1954519,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eliza Petkova","original_name":"Eliza Petkova","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c79ec56c0b3600592147ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4832948,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lorenz Fischer","original_name":"Lorenz Fischer","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/l2tkWloz4xY08AajLeeOTNjHa10.jpg","credit_id":"66f714a35315c2d048c12054","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14760618","wikidata_id":"Q110655560","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bwxwgMV2LZRfqhYu5X3RsIMvM4p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":503}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Shanghai International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
