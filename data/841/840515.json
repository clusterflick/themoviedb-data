Yet British stonemasons and builders would make Gothic architecture their own, inventing a national style for the first time – Perpendicular Gothic – and giving Britain a patriotic backdrop to suit its new ambitions of chivalry and power. From a grand debut at Gloucester Cathedral to commemorate a murdered king to its final glorious flowering at King’s College Chapel in Cambridge, the Perpendicular age was Britain’s finest.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/g7Sj5m1mqXShPJsHUItPP1rsKMP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Architects of the Divine: The First Gothic Age","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1316915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janina Ramirez","original_name":"Janina Ramirez","popularity":0.1031,"profile_path":"/rykuMTefLLKsg8JssYwhBFeqpFX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"60de6f8ecb9f4b005f5f9606","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1316915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janina Ramirez","original_name":"Janina Ramirez","popularity":0.1031,"profile_path":"/rykuMTefLLKsg8JssYwhBFeqpFX.jpg","credit_id":"60de6fe14544af002d34f0df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2127431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Tilzey","original_name":"Paul Tilzey","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60de6faed95420007ea5e51d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4434012","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/g7Sj5m1mqXShPJsHUItPP1rsKMP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
