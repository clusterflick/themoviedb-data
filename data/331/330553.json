His greatest journeys were through the world's largest sand desert: the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Peninsula. Inspired by their hero, adventurers Alastair Humphreys and Leon McCarron attempt a journey of their own into the Empty Quarter. Their trip is hastily-planned and low budget: unable to afford camels they instead hope to drag a homemade steel cart (filled with 300kg of supplies) through the ferocious desert heat. This film is their story.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Into The Empty Quarter","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alastair Humphreys","original_name":"Alastair Humphreys","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5503dcd6c3a36862e500088a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon McCarron","original_name":"Leon McCarron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5503dcedc3a36862dd0008ea","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3393362","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
