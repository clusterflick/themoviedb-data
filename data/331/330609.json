In blatant violation of the Geneva Convention, the Jewish American soldiers in the 106th Infantry Division, together with those who had \"Jewish-sounding\" names or who \"looked\" Jewish, were shipped off to the slave-labor camp at Berga am Elster, a satellite camp of the infamous Buchenwald.","popularity":0.2784,"poster_path":"/mKOJGpih5K8rFtcpq5ojPJue6US.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berga: Soldiers of Another War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Guggenheim","original_name":"Charles Guggenheim","popularity":0.1697,"profile_path":"/wrHL8VTsQw6xH13Ikdh2F1DFkAx.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"550423dfc3a36862dd000d73","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4971692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Abrams","original_name":"Al Abrams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66fa83e2c59a2db32dd007e8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4971693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Acevedo","original_name":"Anthony Acevedo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66fa83fc391013efab132d5e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4971694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herschel Auerbach","original_name":"Herschel Auerbach","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66fa840fcc43cebd03f18978","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4971695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Beier","original_name":"Ernst Beier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66fa84cacc43cebd03f189e1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4971696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morton D.
