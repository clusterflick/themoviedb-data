Kolle explains that an infidelity on the part of one of the two partners by no means has to mean the end of a marriage, but could even be an enrichment. Kolle's explanations are supported by two films in which a wife, neglected by her husband, gives herself to a childhood friend, and a husband, after initially resisting his secretary, finally ends up in bed with her after a fit of jealousy on the part of his wife.","popularity":0.0566,"poster_path":"/e0SGSDVi40Ex6ULMCW8gsuPnUuX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18907,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arca-Winston Films Corp.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1969-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adultery","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262037,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oswalt Kolle","original_name":"Oswalt Kolle","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":"/pCwX7byiJQEVaqRndc1dPUq8Fj0.jpg","credit_id":"59e41330925141082b01f589","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262037,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oswalt Kolle","original_name":"Oswalt Kolle","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":"/pCwX7byiJQEVaqRndc1dPUq8Fj0.jpg","credit_id":"59e41334925141082401ffaa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262037,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oswalt Kolle","original_name":"Oswalt Kolle","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":"/pCwX7byiJQEVaqRndc1dPUq8Fj0.jpg","credit_id":"59e4133d925141082b01f5ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272743,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexis Neve","original_name":"Alexis Neve","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e41344c3a36846540200c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1088742,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heinz Kiessling","original_name":"Heinz Kiessling","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59e4134dc3a36846dd01ee05","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50131,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Werner M.
