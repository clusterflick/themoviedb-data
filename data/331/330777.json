Her boss (whom she refers to as \"Rick the Dick\") is so strict about personal time she can't even apartment hunt with her roommate Maureen. Already suffering from terrifying chronic stress dreams about a creepy, claustrophobic hallway and not wanting anymore pressure, Tina agrees to a lease without ever having laid eyes on the apartment. On moving day, Tina is shocked to discover that the hallway to her new apartment is the hallway from her dreams. Not wanting to worry Maureen and concerned for her sanity Tina attempts to forget it. But the stress dreams worsen and she starts seeing Maureen everywhere: in her dreams, in her office, in the apartment when she is not home. One night it all becomes too much.","popularity":0.2317,"poster_path":"/61luY8z5EgSXER0mCAbbwiwEtYu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hunting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Megan Melnyk","original_name":"Megan Melnyk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Tina","credit_id":"55054988c3a3680581000c74","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Douglas Smith","original_name":"Jordan Douglas Smith","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":"/cyeFgEC5i2rB1ge07z00khhvrdo.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jordan","credit_id":"5fd813b968188800419a2426","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1424910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Abeles","original_name":"Daniel Abeles","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Billy","credit_id":"5fd813ded8e22500401c884e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kent Meister","original_name":"Kent Meister","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Richard Powell","credit_id":"5fd813fda127e500421373d0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2894021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Molly Pope","original_name":"Molly Pope","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Maureen","credit_id":"5fd8141ca127e50041135ea5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Maxfield","original_name":"Laura Maxfield","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5505487a9251416cb700008e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1649766","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/61luY8z5EgSXER0mCAbbwiwEtYu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.752,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vLaF7mirKs1xh27Q18hqg2Zu9Ct.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":564}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
