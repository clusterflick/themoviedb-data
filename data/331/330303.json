Photographer Vancsó Zoltán uses cinema as an irregular photo gallery to invite viewers for a close to 70-minute meditative journey. So there is no need to prepare for dialogue or an explicit story: the experience is based on photographs, taken mostly in forests, using a special, stunningly impressionistic technique, and a matching, meditative soundtrack, jointly created with Tius.","popularity":0.3507,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":48455,"logo_path":null,"name":"PhotoVancso","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2012-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Landslides - Exploring the Void","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438749,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zoltán Vancsó","original_name":"Zoltán Vancsó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550226c8c3a3685ba2003e3b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438751,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tius","original_name":"Tius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55022b1ac3a3685ba2003ec3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438749,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zoltán Vancsó","original_name":"Zoltán Vancsó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55022683c3a3685ba60039a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438749,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zoltán Vancsó","original_name":"Zoltán Vancsó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550226b49251413da8003974","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438749,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zoltán Vancsó","original_name":"Zoltán Vancsó","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55022b4e9251413da80039ea","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6025,"name":"photography"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":164715,"name":"photo"},{"id":178915,"name":"slide show"},{"id":197056,"name":"meditative"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
