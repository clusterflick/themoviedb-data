As director Gérald Calderon travels with a camera from the Jura mountains in Switzerland to the south of France, and to Central America and Africa, insects are shown as workers, soldiers, queens with their children, killers, fighters, and great planners (witness the busy anthill). While viewers are entertained by nearly microscopic close-ups of these tiny inhabitants of our planet, they can enjoy the interpretive narration at the same time.","popularity":0.0688,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Attaville, la véritable histoire des fourmis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gérald Calderon","original_name":"Gérald Calderon","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":"/fObxwxZ1RHzZy5Y6ivIxwIbBd0q.jpg","credit_id":"5502f7f89251414ea60026b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0184232","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
