К. П.","overview":"The defeated remnants of vile Ukrainian nationalists, headed by the leader of the Ukrainian liberation movement, Symon Petliura, cannot accept their historical fate and are plotting an insurrection against the Soviet regime in Ukraine. There is nothing Petliura and his cohorts would not do to win back control over Ukraine, including selling it to the highest bidder, in this case, the Polish dictator Jozef Pilsudski. A group of plotters are coordinating an insurrection in Kyiv with an attack from Poland headed by Petliura’s general Yurko Tiutiunnyk. Predictably, the invincible Red Army defeats the nationalist plotters and proves that the Soviet borders are impregnable.","popularity":1.2903,"poster_path":"/kRHynN1s0ym8VwiKon6WQ7plrGN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25065,"logo_path":"/ugfX3cgasxoDtUjkmWqlthK4hja.png","name":"VUFKU","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1926-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"P.K.P.","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Пилсудский купил Петлюру","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Пілсудський купив Петлюру","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mykola Kuchynskyi","original_name":"Mykola Kuchynskyi","popularity":0.0786,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Symon Petliura","credit_id":"5500a9279251413da5001aa2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1438240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matviy Lyarov","original_name":"Matviy Lyarov","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/qu3jvrd3mUqD40D0ZlwyAm6XBbS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Pilsudski","credit_id":"5500a946c3a3685b96001cdf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuri Tiutiunnyk","original_name":"Yuri Tiutiunnyk","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Yuri Tiutiunnyk","credit_id":"5500a95ec3a3685bab001bb3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmytro Erdman","original_name":"Dmytro Erdman","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Nakonechny","credit_id":"5500a974c3a3685b9b001b81","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1438243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergei Kalinin","original_name":"Sergei Kalinin","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Petrenko","credit_id":"5500a986925141282f0014d8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mykola Nademskyi","original_name":"Микола Надемський","popularity":0.088,"profile_path":"/fw1Exl0fEJt1lS5oNkkYPUziI0W.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5500a990c3a3685b96001ce7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1595573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalya Uzhviy","original_name":"Наталья Ужвий","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/edZJwSGKEChxVXyrFM1ogWM5hWf.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Galina Dombrovskaya","credit_id":"5b3f4b6892514128f000661f","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1329888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aksel Lundin","original_name":"Aksel Lundin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6521a26cea84c7014e001de4","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georgiy Stabovoy","original_name":"Georgiy Stabovoy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mbhneDKISp9k0J7mhmu5yn3rUSV.jpg","credit_id":"5500a865c3a3685b9b001b6f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georgiy Stabovoy","original_name":"Georgiy Stabovoy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mbhneDKISp9k0J7mhmu5yn3rUSV.jpg","credit_id":"5500a88cc3a3685bab001ba9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438233,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marius Holdt","original_name":"Marius Holdt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5500a8c99251413da1001a87","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1438235,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Grigori Drobin","original_name":"Grigori Drobin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5500a8d7c3a3685ba6001e31","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7410882","wikidata_id":"Q16684152","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kRHynN1s0ym8VwiKon6WQ7plrGN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":247508,"name":"soviet union history"},{"id":298528,"name":"political drama"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1926-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
