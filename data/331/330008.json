Serving as guides through Lecuona’s music are three of the most gifted Latin jazz pianists in the world: Chucho Valdés, Michel Camilo, and Gonzalo Rubalcaba. Valdés fuses Latin jazz together with Afro-Cuban rhythms in Lecuona’s native Havana; Camilo recreates elegant aural soundscapes in New York and the Canary Islands; and Rubalcaba fuses jazz and flamenco in Seville, the heart of Andalusian Spain. Together, these three musicians provide a rich portrait of Lecuona’s music and its lasting influence.","popularity":0.0462,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Playing Lecuona","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Giroud","original_name":"Pavel Giroud","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"598b922e9251417a410002cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Giroud","original_name":"Pavel Giroud","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"598b92379251417a410002d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866953,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Santiago Torres Marrero","original_name":"Santiago Torres Marrero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"598b92b99251417a65000325","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4973672,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Juan Manuel Villar Betancort","original_name":"Juan Manuel Villar Betancort","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fbb4b18aa734b376a66d17","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3522866","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"PLAYING LECUONA Trailer","key":"EA03oQnQ6IE","published_at":"2015-09-30T22:52:37.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"598b92fcc3a368636c00039d"}]}}}
