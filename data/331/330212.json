For a 92-year-old mother, Mimi, who has cared 64 years for her daughter, Dona, who has an intellectual disability, it means facing the inevitable -- she will not outlive her daughter -- and finding her daughter a home. This poignant, heartbreaking and, at times, humorous documentary traces this process through the story of a wonderfully quirky and deeply connected mother-daughter duo. The film spotlights the challenges of aging caregivers of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities -- some 4.6 million Americans, 75 percent of whom live at home with family -- and details the ripple effects of Dona's disability on three generations of a Texas family.","popularity":0.3469,"poster_path":"/oPGY7Oaa3YMeSc7QfoKwCvCQHPE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mimi and Dona","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154839,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sophie Sartain","original_name":"Sophie Sartain","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"5beb3514c3a368174605ab64","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154839,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sophie Sartain","original_name":"Sophie Sartain","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5beb352a925141582804aeba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154839,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sophie Sartain","original_name":"Sophie Sartain","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5beb354e92514143e605a6ed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154839,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sophie Sartain","original_name":"Sophie Sartain","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5beb3563c3a368174e05b8c9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154839,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sophie Sartain","original_name":"Sophie Sartain","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5beb3533c3a368173a060eaf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2175038,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Linda Osher","original_name":"Linda Osher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5beb35870e0a263bf505fc0a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":163461,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marta Kauffman","original_name":"Marta Kauffman","popularity":0.3198,"profile_path":"/AsX4ZOoQP5oQVLiA51zdRiTNKTm.jpg","credit_id":"5beb3544c3a36876cf02ee95","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410002,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nancy Spielberg","original_name":"Nancy Spielberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5beb355b92514143db05a244","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2175037,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris Callister","original_name":"Chris Callister","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5beb35720e0a263c0605e654","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4203996","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oPGY7Oaa3YMeSc7QfoKwCvCQHPE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4oVms085injA8roj4SmaBrOMXz3.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
