Pickford plays Lola, a young Filipino woman who falls in love with Duncan (William E. Shay), a Caucasian man sent to her village on business.  After Lola risks her life nursing his fever and saving him from a knife attack, Duncan marries her and resists the temptation to return to his American fiancée.  Directed by Thomas Ince and co-starring Pickford’s first husband Owen Moore, A Manly Man was later reissued under the title His Gratitude (1914).","popularity":0.3613,"poster_path":"/9TarlGH2kNV0FHgXjGEsVNEDOs2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Moving Pictures Co. of America (IMP)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Manly Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Pickford","original_name":"Mary Pickford","popularity":0.6455,"profile_path":"/y0FHoj9AjmVveKkdeFuqhuVYaTf.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Lola","credit_id":"55066eedc3a3683d78000094","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Owen Moore","original_name":"Owen Moore","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":"/6iBzyALpUaf22lKD2kRgzmsHGuC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Norman Duncan","credit_id":"55066f159251416cb7001d10","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14475,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carl Laemmle","original_name":"Carl Laemmle","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":"/4UBMh6AJxS5gUJVlkIgswDc3rlJ.jpg","credit_id":"55066f9a92514174b6003aed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carla Laemmle","original_name":"Carla Laemmle","popularity":0.1503,"profile_path":"/eawNvIq0bzuWEmi2py4KBySNyJj.jpg","credit_id":"55066f859251411db40021d6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931237,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas H.
