His father was an alcoholic operatic tenor and his mother was a pianist. Growing up in the tough neighborhoods of Mexico City, José began his career as a singer in serenades, and later in a jazz trio. His father died and his career took off due to his enormous talent. José started a relationship with Anel (Bach), a beautiful young actress, but because of his alcoholism and infidelities, she leaves him. José marries Kiki Herrera (Gina Romand), a beautiful socialite twenty years older than he is. After several fights and irreconcilable differences, José leaves her. After suffering a terrible pneumonia that nearly ended his career, Anel returns to be by his side and he recovers. After a couple of years without success, José signed a contract with a major record label and returns to the pinnacle of success to stay there for the rest of his career.","popularity":0.306,"poster_path":"/tt1Rmc4ZwpPp4ueTgyZIjNPyzIC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1985-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gavilán o Paloma","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1243418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José José","original_name":"José José","popularity":0.2392,"profile_path":"/vM9FsB0ilZEcqyBrePYNwu9xD85.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"José Sosa 'José José'","credit_id":"55044934c3a36862e1000f78","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1252014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Bach","original_name":"Christian Bach","popularity":0.1298,"profile_path":"/wqAk0Z43r3c8rHBO5HwjzvZoeM3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Anel","credit_id":"5504493f92514174aa001001","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gina Romand","original_name":"Gina Romand","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kiki Herrera","credit_id":"5504494d9251412c05000e69","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norma Lazareno","original_name":"Norma Lazareno","popularity":0.2908,"profile_path":"/f9QNajPBLWXU8MRd66lSwxui6A6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"659a36d015959f025b6dbc5c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1458383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo","original_name":"Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":"/1tTfyGSKTZuzUYRwHKn6Nn28Wub.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"553a83dc9251411256007fc4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1729517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Palavicini","original_name":"Fernando Palavicini","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62267828d4d509001d6c11ba","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfredo Gurrola","original_name":"Alfredo Gurrola","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/cF7kuipAv1M4MldprpjkvIzb6mz.jpg","credit_id":"5504495fc3a36862e1000f7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236220,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fernando Galiana","original_name":"Fernando Galiana","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":"/vzHDAZ4K7wL9kMAzIdkds1ycyqA.jpg","credit_id":"5504496bc3a36862e1000f7e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0236247","wikidata_id":"Q5528068","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tt1Rmc4ZwpPp4ueTgyZIjNPyzIC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"José José Pelicula Gavilan o Paloma DVD/BLURAY","key":"E9OZWPW-Pfg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-01T01:56:41.000Z","id":"5dcbc2691d78f2001423eaaf"}]}}}
