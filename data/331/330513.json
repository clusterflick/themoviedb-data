For these two extended teenagers, it's the end of night outings and improvised weekends. She is quickly overwhelmed and Philippe, who runs an advertising company, is not often there. On the other hand, the family - grandmother or godfather - is too much. And then she begins to choke. As a fashion designer, she first tries to work at home but can not share herself between her professional and maternal activities. Philippe tries to help her, in vain, then abandons to flee to Deauville for an extra-marital weekend. She will not forgive him and will disappear with Julie. And years go by before the little girl who grew up finds herself again between her mother and her father, accompanying her, for the first time, to school.","popularity":0.1543,"poster_path":"/xjyqGnooBLrzWjBpy0gUfrFJUEh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un amour d'emmerdeuse","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La petite merveille","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439461,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Olivia Orlandi","original_name":"Olivia Orlandi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Catherine","credit_id":"55035839c3a3682cc1000039","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106526,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Raphaël Delpard","original_name":"Raphaël Delpard","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Philippe","credit_id":"55035842c3a3682cd100002f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Franco","original_name":"Alain Franco","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"5503584ac3a3682cbe000032","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marthe Villalonga","original_name":"Marthe Villalonga","popularity":0.2257,"profile_path":"/bcpBFXMmgZuRl5cQa4jqmemsmjY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The grandmother","credit_id":"55035853c3a3682ccb000021","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Perrin","original_name":"Francis Perrin","popularity":0.2281,"profile_path":"/eobshSiqb3Rd7cwGn9TbO53QLaf.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Maxime","credit_id":"5503585b92514146d5000028","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Cartier","original_name":"Caroline Cartier","popularity":0.2208,"profile_path":"/suR4QV4lBvwAomFj4oJijjaiF3k.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Laurence","credit_id":"55035867c3a3682cc7000032","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Thérèse Roy","original_name":"Marie-Thérèse Roy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Lucie","credit_id":"5503587092514146e100001d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline Clément","original_name":"Jacqueline Clément","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Jacqueline","credit_id":"55035878c3a3682cc400001d","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439461,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Olivia Orlandi","original_name":"Olivia Orlandi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5503582bc3a3682cc1000033","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439460,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alain Vandercoille","original_name":"Alain Vandercoille","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55035800c3a3682cc1000025","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439464,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roger Poulet","original_name":"Roger Poulet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5503589492514146df000028","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6789,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Marcel Grignon","original_name":"Marcel Grignon","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550358a292514146d800002f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439460,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alain Vandercoille","original_name":"Alain Vandercoille","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5503580992514146da000022","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0339837","wikidata_id":"Q55600087","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.74,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/xjyqGnooBLrzWjBpy0gUfrFJUEh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":757}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
