We are overwhelmed by its power, fascinated by its cunning, drawn by its confrontations. Football brings life to college campuses on Saturdays, it monopolizes NFL cities on Sunday afternoons, and it transfixes the nation with the Super Bowl. But football's special appeal begins at the grassroots level. That's where the game transcends age, size, and locale, where participants need to share only a spirit of competition. Football America reminds us why Americans love this game.","popularity":0.3026,"poster_path":"/h1wabYo4CJ9n5N7dfLEORxqa1wQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3232,"logo_path":"/8KtxMsWLOK6zDTNAfi75yg2QvSt.png","name":"NFL Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Football America","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"NFL Films Presents Football America","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Coburn","original_name":"James Coburn","popularity":3.7657,"profile_path":"/9GApjInyrVvjnTAr652C1aViPqZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"55042b7fc3a368256a000c30","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439783,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ray Didinger","original_name":"Ray Didinger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55042bd892514174b0000d99","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1262656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Tuckett","original_name":"Phil Tuckett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55042b6d92514174b0000d8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":485241,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Sabol","original_name":"Steve Sabol","popularity":0.1343,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b6e619ac416101391d5744","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1209148,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg Kohs","original_name":"Greg Kohs","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":"/gEkw0Ayv0d72q0UetkuqSVTnIHW.jpg","credit_id":"64b6e64a0bb076014e507d79","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1788417,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jeff Hillegass","original_name":"Jeff Hillegass","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b6e66013654500c731bf21","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1388775","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h1wabYo4CJ9n5N7dfLEORxqa1wQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kwEgTGJfidb2USBQHh9QJA4aCLg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
