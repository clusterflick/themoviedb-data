In 2004, Cambodian union president Chea Vichea was assassinated in broad daylight at a newsstand in Phnom Penh. As international pressure mounted, two men were swiftly arrested and convicted of the crime, each sentenced to twenty years in prison. Filmmaker Bradley Cox’s five-year investigation reveals an elaborate cover-up that reaches the highest echelons of Cambodian society.  Winner of a 2011 Peabody Award among many other honors and banned by the Cambodian government, WHO KILLED CHEA VICHEA? uncovers the face of dictatorship behind the mask of democracy.","popularity":0.1405,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":95328,"logo_path":null,"name":"Loud Mouth Films","origin_country":""},{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13640,"logo_path":"/sUaed08coGdAxraWn7vAvvdRFoQ.png","name":"Corporation for Public Broadcasting","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","name":"Cambodia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Khmer","iso_639_1":"km","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The truth can be fatal","title":"Who Killed Chea Vichea?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":970793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bradley Cox","original_name":"Bradley Cox","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bc29251416c7510d141","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1276121","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"whokilledcheavichea","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2960,"name":"cambodia"},{"id":441,"name":"assassination"},{"id":6149,"name":"police"},{"id":407,"name":"dictator"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Chea Vichea: Made In Cambodia","key":"QzEOZe-7uZA","published_at":"2012-04-30T21:41:38.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"id":"59c6dbf39251415b2404d5f5"}]}}}
