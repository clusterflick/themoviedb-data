A passionate woman who fills her home with poetry and paintings, Annie is a genuine romantic which also leaves her vulnerable to disappointment and occasional delusion. As the evening progresses, her expectations of love transform as she faces painful truths about her past and present. Fueled by the strong words of her favorite poet -- Federico Garcia Lorca -- Annie will redefine her vision for the future and her definition of happiness over the course of this dark night of reckoning.","popularity":0.8516,"poster_path":"/rj7A3ap3j4CRJIcZjwWlrRKkNG7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Camellias","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Annie and the Gypsy","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cybill Shepherd","original_name":"Cybill Shepherd","popularity":1.9088,"profile_path":"/ci20y6ilSmiw759cUwQVheOqNaD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Annie","credit_id":"640c2ded323eba00a2a632e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":204632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Burtka","original_name":"David Burtka","popularity":0.2688,"profile_path":"/pf7YnpF2hlvKitpzFEnmxSwAPlf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Martin","credit_id":"640c2dfb323eba00ef6102b0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151380,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Paige","original_name":"Peter Paige","popularity":0.2985,"profile_path":"/9qLFoMRyGjYx0yjdNvJLyR5m3OR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Roger","credit_id":"640c2e0bb42242008a2cbe45","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gia Carides","original_name":"Gia Carides","popularity":0.6761,"profile_path":"/ozzUvRlmtj9eSAaycFXOVSB7ulz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dana","credit_id":"640c2e251ac292008555351c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3958569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Franklin","original_name":"David Franklin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Donovan","credit_id":"640c2e3d1ac29200f630817f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lenny Von Dohlen","original_name":"Lenny Von Dohlen","popularity":0.4687,"profile_path":"/yZfisRYu3aEDRa0AaEIjMhkmW8w.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gordon","credit_id":"640c2e491ac292007c349546","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryce Johnson","original_name":"Bryce Johnson","popularity":0.5452,"profile_path":"/iyHjMvKijZZDVZkK681JAio4nAh.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"640c2e582a09bc00e8442e21","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1646418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eliezer Ortiz","original_name":"Eliezer Ortiz","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":"/mOMIeZFd4nwgXpI8mx1KagtwVm6.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"The Gypsy","credit_id":"640c2e65a6c10400d8d5ef74","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3958570,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Russell Brown","original_name":"Russell Brown","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640c2e891ac2920081d0a19d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931316,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Federico García Lorca","original_name":"Federico García Lorca","popularity":0.0943,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640c2ec71ac29200b8ca403e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1041015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Russell Brown","original_name":"Russell Brown","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640c2e9eb4224200f78f21d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2290829","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rj7A3ap3j4CRJIcZjwWlrRKkNG7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
