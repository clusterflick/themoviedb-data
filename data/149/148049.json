The film features a head-on, close-up shot of a penis ‘mouthing’ the parliamentary defense of the law by its author. A landmark in political pamphleteering, the film was selected for the 1968 Oberhausen International Short Film Festival by a committee of leading German critics and promptly banned by the city government, causing the withdrawal of almost all German directors from the festival and a national scandal. The title satirically refers to the official certificate of ‘Particularly Valuable’ given each year to the best film shorts by an Establishment selection.","popularity":0.076,"poster_path":"/5tZVRYKF8owGecrWdw4M553sMbY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1968-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Of Special Merit","video":false,"vote_average":3.6,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Particulièrement valable","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":66833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hellmuth Costard","original_name":"Hellmuth Costard","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4bbd9251416c7510c8d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1127055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Toussaint","original_name":"Hans Toussaint","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"52fe4bbd9251416c7510c8d7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":66833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hellmuth Costard","original_name":"Hellmuth Costard","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bbd9251416c7510c8cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":66833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hellmuth Costard","original_name":"Hellmuth Costard","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58c257cdc3a36842d60088de","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0062727","wikidata_id":"Q830018","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/5tZVRYKF8owGecrWdw4M553sMbY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
