The house itself is heavily decorated, mostly by Cocteau (and a bit by Picasso), and we are given an extensive tour of the artwork. Cocteau also shows us several dozen paintings as well. Most cover mythological themes, of course. He also proudly shows paintings by Edouard Dermithe and Jean Marais and plays around his own home in Villefranche.","popularity":0.1465,"poster_path":"/nUERxRDnR3Tal1XIqD1aYkmdaBm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1952-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Villa Santo-Sospir","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Cocteau","original_name":"Jean Cocteau","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":"/vD73WSmN0hH3ZDjlh6n73CJI5sC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b5844f40e0a2673d804dcfa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Cocteau","original_name":"Jean Cocteau","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":"/vD73WSmN0hH3ZDjlh6n73CJI5sC.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bc99251416c7510dee1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11205,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Wladimir Ivanov","original_name":"Wladimir Ivanov","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"571323adc3a368537000cf0a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234336,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédéric Rossif","original_name":"Frédéric Rossif","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/lDhKDrqxaG2HgY8yidzgdsSf0td.jpg","credit_id":"571323b6c3a3686678006a8e","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0206394","wikidata_id":"Q6465810","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rJKgFbHdduIolmyp42pek09galc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":822,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/n2LKAz18YwTbb5d0DmY8BZxtWQ4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":548},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nUERxRDnR3Tal1XIqD1aYkmdaBm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":246208,"name":"tattooed house"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"West Germany","release_date":"1975-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
