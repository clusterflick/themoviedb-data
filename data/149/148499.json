The French transgender singer known as Coccinelle was one of the first to use Burou’s services, and many others followed. Michiel Van Erp’s film follows five women who underwent surgery during that time, just before the sexual revolution and the Gay Liberation movement of the 1960's. Intimate interviews reveal their lifestyle, what made them change their sex, how it influenced their lives, and how they cope with the unavoidable ageing.","popularity":0.3333,"poster_path":"/pPk1hf7Q4KWiJZUWbVgixhS00Qo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41816,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Familie","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":239,"logo_path":"/96hCWEsfmTZQsoUap0CcG21qaA.png","name":"VPRO","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2011-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am a Woman Now","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Tora eimai gynaika","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","title":"Ja sam sada žena","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1127754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"April Ashley","original_name":"April Ashley","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/srBp5a3rCfw3EGfpCSwpDF6MFyz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4bcc9251416c7510e561","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1127755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colette Berends","original_name":"Colette Berends","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4bcc9251416c7510e565","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1127756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Lessenich","original_name":"Jean Lessenich","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4bcc9251416c7510e569","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1127758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corinne van Tongerloo","original_name":"Corinne van Tongerloo","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4bcc9251416c7510e571","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1309371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bambi","original_name":"Bambi","popularity":1.531,"profile_path":"/3k4NI7VFiUfmhAW9XDFo1peagSg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"59404a409251414aee0141cf","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michiel van Erp","original_name":"Michiel van Erp","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":"/c0VFdUtyffBRc6MHA2Th4lZObpf.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bcc9251416c7510e55d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833089,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Louis ter Burg","original_name":"Louis ter Burg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59404aa69251417a8300a50e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261640,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mark van Aller","original_name":"Mark van Aller","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59404aaf9251414b020131b3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2190287","wikidata_id":"Q2192584","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dqcOe3kUyzjxSjIprygW3TnrqbA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/pPk1hf7Q4KWiJZUWbVgixhS00Qo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":571,"name":"transsexuality"},{"id":1623,"name":"casablanca, morocco"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IDFA International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam","release_date":"2011-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
