In the novel’s six cantos, a young misanthrope indulges in depraved and destructive acts. Unexpected encounters abound, with turtles and birds joining Terayama’s regular cast of snails and dogs to wander over books and bare torsos. Feverish video processing posterizes, inverts and overlays images that are further colored by sound—pushing the limits of his literary adaptation. Terayama wrote that the only tombstone he wanted was his words, but, as Les chants de Maldoror demonstrates, words need not be confined to carved monuments or bound hardcopies.","popularity":0.1378,"poster_path":"/aZ9haOAeUYSQfi1EqOcAeN4Tl0g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12797,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jinriki Hikoki Sha","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1978-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les chants de Maldoror","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Marudororu no uta","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":137516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keiko Niitaka","original_name":"新高恵子","popularity":0.2796,"profile_path":"/3IJfppa52tcKAQJfPrkBdyPENnL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4bbe9251416c7510c9fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1127064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susumu Oono","original_name":"Susumu Oono","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4bbe9251416c7510c9ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1127065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoko Ran","original_name":"Yoko Ran","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":"/k6aQEzoJuJJ7monji2S5GqAUiLq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4bbe9251416c7510ca03","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shūji Terayama","original_name":"寺山修司","popularity":0.2033,"profile_path":"/n2zFgMKGmniENJIDijCA4koXRcj.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bbe9251416c7510c9f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shūji Terayama","original_name":"寺山修司","popularity":0.2033,"profile_path":"/n2zFgMKGmniENJIDijCA4koXRcj.jpg","credit_id":"57ee65edc3a3684d9a0055c4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200245,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Akio Suzuki","original_name":"Akio Suzuki","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ee6626c3a3682aa10042b4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1686904,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Comte de Lautréamont","original_name":"Comte de Lautréamont","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ee65d6c3a3682a65003b7d","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17550,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tatsuo Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木達夫","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/1Cpzp20MdjIoDzslu7hjvDHRMje.jpg","credit_id":"5c6870670e0a262be69528cf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0896550","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/aZ9haOAeUYSQfi1EqOcAeN4Tl0g.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: MUBI (IFFR)","release_date":"1978-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
