The two are thrown together in a share house after Wills outstays his welcome in the home of his girlfriend, and a newspaper classified ad leads him to Burke, who has a room to rent. The beginnings of an awkward relationship develop through beer-assisted conversations about cooking, travel, and the importance of satisfactory toilet visits.","popularity":0.088,"poster_path":"/2UA3G08ZzOBkPLfj7m4ZScJIniQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burke & Wills","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Torr","original_name":"Oliver Torr","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Burke","credit_id":"544cc6d10e0a2608c2001e54","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":78569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Zeremes","original_name":"Matt Zeremes","popularity":0.112,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Wills (as Matthew Zeremes)","credit_id":"544cc6ec0e0a2608d0001e22","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Feuerriegel","original_name":"Daniel Feuerriegel","popularity":0.2432,"profile_path":"/jwJK6SpCwDiZoYH3WF3xosbpZc3.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Guy","credit_id":"544cc6b30e0a2608d0001e1b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Torr","original_name":"Oliver Torr","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b62396925141246c0009b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":78569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Zeremes","original_name":"Matt Zeremes","popularity":0.112,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b623a09251417c21004f47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0799960","wikidata_id":"Q127600794","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.72,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2UA3G08ZzOBkPLfj7m4ZScJIniQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
