The film borrows heavily from the plot lines of some of Bergman's most famous films. The dialogue, seemingly in Swedish, is actually a Swedish-accented fictional language based on English, German, Latin, and Swedish, with most nouns ending in \"ska.\" The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film.","popularity":0.8041,"poster_path":"/foO8P41bUt2p9C4PDFSdUOGTKLi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Audio
