Back then, we used ‘Mikrat’ film to make a story about found photographs. Until 2024, the material was stored as a film copy with an optical soundtrack. After 25 years, the film was finally edited and reimagined, with young sound director Dasha Solodova re-dubbing the image. She preserved the essence of the old soundtrack while creating a new one with present-day sounds.”","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leningrad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4959845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Leskina","original_name":"Elena Leskina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66f283bac237258e4c26daae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4959846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyudmila Smirnova","original_name":"Lyudmila Smirnova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66f283d7de2d52dfbd8d771d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4959849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yaroslav Fomichev","original_name":"Yaroslav Fomichev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66f283f1c237258e4c26dad3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4959850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grigory Zhikharevich","original_name":"Grigory Zhikharevich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66f284080315b91f463b5b9e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3268209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kseniya Burdinova","original_name":"Ksenia Burdinova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f283280315b91f463b5b0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377273,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexey Solodov","original_name":"Alexey Solodov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f2838cc237258e4c26da7f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2179066,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anton Semenov","original_name":"Anton Semenov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f2839ba97880148f3b659c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3204653,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Darya Solodova","original_name":"Дарья Солодова","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f283a8c237258e4c26daa1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
