With their Trabant and trailer, they set off for a small private accommodation near the border of what was then West Germany. This autobiographical animated documentary follows the family on their journey, providing a glimpse into the curious details of a typical GDR vacation so close to the western border.  Between the Volkspolizei, border patrols, shortages, and idyllic beach scenes in East Germany's vacation paradise, this animated docufilm swings back and forth. Personal memories and carefully documented facts merge into a travel diary brought to life through animation.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/iFHsl9w4PhrOFjvKZcJJG5fMI1l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Balance Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"wider horizons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"wider horizons","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Falk Schuster","original_name":"Falk Schuster","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f002266c3b7a8d648d72d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Falk Schuster","original_name":"Falk Schuster","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f00232b348bea4eb3b5be1","department":"Writing","job":"Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Falk Schuster","original_name":"Falk Schuster","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f0023f0ea80d1fe38d6d64","department":"Directing","job":"Layout"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4956319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Romanowsky","original_name":"Tim Romanowsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f0024f0ea80d1fe38d6d72","department":"Directing","job":"Layout"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4956320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Schmidt","original_name":"Alexander Schmidt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f00264a82b005703264243","department":"Directing","job":"Layout"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4956322,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Julian Quitsch","original_name":"Julian Quitsch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f0028c7300a5ba213b4a4f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Falk Schuster","original_name":"Falk Schuster","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f0029d6c3b7a8d648d72f0","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4956319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Romanowsky","original_name":"Tim Romanowsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f002ab92d39685383b68db","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4956320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Schmidt","original_name":"Alexander Schmidt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f002bc92d39685383b68e2","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4956323,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Piek","original_name":"Peter Piek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f002c892d39685383b68ee","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/skPYsmBYjeYWWe4fXOYsXABKMXb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/iFHsl9w4PhrOFjvKZcJJG5fMI1l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
