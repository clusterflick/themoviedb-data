Here they are met by unrest, police states and a black mouse who is a member of the Black Panthers. The mouse, who we never see, tells of racial hatred and persecution of black people. Little brother disappears in the big city, but Cirkeline and Frederik ally with some Indians to find him again. The soldiers open fire, also on Frederik and Cirkeline. Fortunately, it turns out that the soldiers are plastic toy soldiers that you can just push over, and the Indian chief is Ingolf. Fortunately, it was just a game.","popularity":0.0416,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circleen - The escape from America","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jannik Hastrup","original_name":"Jannik Hastrup","popularity":0.0744,"profile_path":"/dysoEkxjaTNKTIlxYFsv63JXiI1.jpg","credit_id":"66f03fa34a7f0b18b0266b27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
