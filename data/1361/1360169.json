Drawing on her own childhood memories as well as her fertile imagination, filmmaker Martine Frossard paints a compassionate portrait of a woman on a quest for healing in a society with little tolerance for difference. Rich in symbolism inspired by plant life, her film is a heartfelt plea for us all to take greater heed of our emotions, even the most painful ones—reminding us that to be sensitive is to be alive.","popularity":0.1077,"poster_path":"/73eKaT37YZcu2NPsn4Mxznx4wXn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2025-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Hypersensitive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2096110,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martine Frossard","original_name":"Martine Frossard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f052e7a82b00570326562a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2592,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/73eKaT37YZcu2NPsn4Mxznx4wXn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2592,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/jfrP4hE8rGaYvPV197Mvlu2c1d2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"2025 Sommets du cinéma d’animation","release_date":"2025-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
