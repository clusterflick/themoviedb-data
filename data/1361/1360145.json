Bass Man finds Takahiro during the 2001 season, the year that began his rise to superstardom against all odds in a sport that’s on its way to becoming the next NASCAR. Takahiro looks to two icons of the sport, Rick Clunn and Jay Yelas, to try and unlock the secrets of their successes and becomes torn between their opposing philosophies on life, God and fishing. Bass Man is an unprecedented behind-the-scenes look at this wildly popular and sometimes bizarre sport- the icons, the fans, the history, and the professional fishermen, some forging careers the likes of rock stars, others just struggling to survive.","popularity":0.1778,"poster_path":"/l1ZIJqFzyUMQneW25HZYZiEujXS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152747,"logo_path":null,"name":"7th Art Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bass Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4961886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takahiro Omori","original_name":"Takahiro Omori","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66f38d077091d5755d69dbe5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4956704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Bayer","original_name":"Michael Bayer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f0461592d39685383b7f4c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":868,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l1ZIJqFzyUMQneW25HZYZiEujXS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":576}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":1495,"name":"fishing"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Guessed on release date, couldn’t find anything.","release_date":"2005-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
