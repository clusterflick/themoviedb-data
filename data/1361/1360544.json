Water was central to that trade. It was the means used to ship human beings–treated as cargo/free labour– to the New World to create wealth. A poetic text on screen overlays a montage of moving images of water and waves. A soundscape of a griot’s voice and mournful echoes of distant keening and the scritch of a ship’s tackle conveys present to past, and a return to present. This reflective film lays bare the lingering emotional impact of the willful theft and ill-treatment of African people.","popularity":0.0789,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waters of the Diaspora","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sylvia Hamilton","original_name":"Sylvia Hamilton","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/bvjiNBnYzXWwS6XjUnQkbRASv0k.jpg","credit_id":"66f15e3dde2d52dfbd8d2549","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sylvia Hamilton","original_name":"Sylvia Hamilton","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/bvjiNBnYzXWwS6XjUnQkbRASv0k.jpg","credit_id":"66f15e4ca97880148f3b11f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4958226,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul Robinson","original_name":"Paul Robinson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f15e59583c56cdb125fa77","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
