This wry and ironic tape moves swiftly between pop-culture quotes and today's conventional wisdom on the relationship between genetics and identity. Consistently unbalancing the viewers' expectations with its comic visual juxtapositions, Looking for Wendy is finally a highly contemporary take on the complexities and contradictions of the search for the authentic self.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking for Wendy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4958653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kimberly SaRee Tomes","original_name":"Kimberly SaRee Tomes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f194aea97880148f3b2b92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
