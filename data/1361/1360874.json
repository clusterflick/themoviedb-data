It became known as Rancho La Puerta, a sanctuary for people from all over the world to come and learn about health and wellness. That 17-year-old girl, Deborah Szekely, is now 102 years old and is the living embodiment of everything the Ranch aspires to be and to teach. The Ranch and its sister property, The Golden Door in San Marcos, California, continue today to serve celebrities, royalty, and anyone in search of a healthier life. Szekely is considered the founder of the modern-day spa industry, the Godmother of Fitness, and this film explores her incredible life, along with the obstacles and triumphs of being a woman entrepreneur.","popularity":0.069,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wellness Warrior","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2613218,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chaz Ebert","original_name":"Chaz Ebert","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":"/aIdAdFGLTDeUlAm4HJetHjkvx1.jpg","credit_id":"66f21ce0de2d52dfbd8d60e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33483868","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
