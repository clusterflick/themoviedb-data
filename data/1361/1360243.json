Inspired by Albert Camus' The Myth of Sisyphus, this acclaimed tour de force is magnificently captured in an eventful film that emotionally reminds us that behind every human tragedy lies a journey as liberating as it is salutary. A masterly production to match a spectacular performance, accompanied by the notes of the Montreal band Dear Criminals.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/qBtS0COtFcCNOnlBSkVBpGL0Xa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sisyphus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1736692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Pilon","original_name":"Victor Pilon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66f078e47ff2bf57cd266f86","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1736692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victor Pilon","original_name":"Victor Pilon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f078df6c3b7a8d648d9254","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28357408","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/qBtS0COtFcCNOnlBSkVBpGL0Xa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
