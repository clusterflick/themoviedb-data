But as bizarre as the revelations were, so too were the newspaper’s methods. FRONTLINE producers Rachel Dretzin and Barak Goodman investigate the complex relationship between politics, sexuality, fear, and judgment in one all-American town.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FRONTLINE: A Hidden Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":933388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Dretzin","original_name":"Rachel Dretzin","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/b7IZW9Lv2DsvfLYIU3LRgccoml3.jpg","credit_id":"66f1fa696c3b7a8d648e051b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4959269,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barak Goodman","original_name":"Barak Goodman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f1fa95583c56cdb12638ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
