Over a turbulent 24-hour period, followed by the loss of her part-time job, SABRINA (Mara Da Costa Reis) world is turned around. As she struggles with her emotional upheaval, we see her perspective shift to that of an outsider, observing the rhythms of a city that’s cold and indifferent to her struggle, making her question her place in the big city. She’s ultimately faced with whether she wants to continue to be a part of it, only to come to a quiet realization that she’s got the strength to persevere.  *This film is dedicated to the loving memory of MARA DA COSTA REIS, whom we miss so dearly. A talented creative soul who poured her heart into this film and all the other projects she was ever part of.","popularity":0.1073,"poster_path":"/mbO53Z2LDRTu1kVtTtuwtw2ICWd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"SABRINA, short film, drama.","title":"Sabrina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4957071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mara Da Costa Reis","original_name":"Mara Da Costa Reis","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/n9YSNf5k8YU1Ey9GITsy3fi81Jx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sabrina","credit_id":"66f08c50583c56cdb125c9c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4957072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikey Bennett","original_name":"Mikey Bennett","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/egV9Hk8er5gCkGkUJoGxCcOl1iy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67e4200c7db9e70c47dcade9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4957072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikey Bennett","original_name":"Mikey Bennett","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/egV9Hk8er5gCkGkUJoGxCcOl1iy.jpg","credit_id":"66f08c65a82b005703265f35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/otyadu097c14lza9GxTH4zynJu4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2588,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mbO53Z2LDRTu1kVtTtuwtw2ICWd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1726}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9672,"name":"based on true story"},{"id":323116,"name":"emotional journey"},{"id":326486,"name":"emotional turmoil"},{"id":339459,"name":"based on real events"},{"id":340734,"name":"emotional struggle"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SABRINA / short film / teaser","key":"467820783","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-10-13T16:55:16.000Z","id":"66f08d53a97880148f3ade40"}]}}}
