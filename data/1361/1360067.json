MusicStories takes you on a cinematic journey through classical music. It draws on various genres and visual languages - from black-and-white silent films to historical melodramas and romantic comedies. Specially interpreted classics such as Beethoven's “Für Elise” and “In the Hall of the Mountain King” by Edvard Grieg serve as the film music. The format creates a new kind of access to the audience through the symbiosis of classical music and narrative film.","popularity":0.2109,"poster_path":"/rqwxlZ3TW8jd0DoBCWTQ1pzhumT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MusicStories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4956430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neele
