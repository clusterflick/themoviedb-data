In 1973, to commemorate its 119th anniversary, the original Eureka flag was unveiled by the Prime Minister Gough Whitlam at the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery in Victoria. In his speech Mr Whitlam identified the Eureka Stockade with the birth of democracy in Australia and Immigration minister Al Grassby read verses by the people's poet Henry Lawson in honour of the occasion.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/sqwPvQmPVYWEMDkqUcQbre3T8Yd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8884,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Australia","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flag of Stars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4958323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keith Gow","original_name":"Keith Gow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f16971c237258e4c268c37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1012,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sqwPvQmPVYWEMDkqUcQbre3T8Yd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Produced by Film Australia for the Department of Immigration ","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
