As a child, she was forbidden to speak her language. To preserve it, she secretly spoke Mi’kmaq to the ladybugs. Phyllis never lost her language. She raised her children to be fluent speakers and taught Mi’kmaq at We’koqma’q Mi’kmaw School in We’koqma’q First Nation, Cape Breton Nova Scotia. This creative collaboration between Phyllis and Halifax filmmaker Ann Verrall, was inspired by Phyllis’ deep desire to share her story so that there will be greater understanding of today’s Indigenous youth.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phyllis and the Ladybugs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4958255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phyllis Googoo","original_name":"Phyllis Googoo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f162b52d98d59ce13b005b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2028334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Verrall","original_name":"Ann Verrall","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f162f9a97880148f3b14b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
