In the early 1980s, hardcore music also gained a strong foothold in the region, and during the 1990s this music scene exploded. Linköping then became a central point in the county but also one of the largest cities in Sweden when it came to hardcore. Everything happened at \"Skylten\", an old closed machine sign factory that the municipality handed over to the city's youth to manage in true \"do it yourself\" spirit. Concerts were staged all the time and big foreign bands often came to visit, which put Linköping on the map abroad as well. This film deals with the birth of hardcore music in Östergötland during the 1980s and its heyday during the 1990s in Linköping, but also looks ahead and gives an insight into today's music scene where \"Skylten\" still plays a central role in Linköping's musical life.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ös - the story of Linköping hardcore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
