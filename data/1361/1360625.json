Money had been stolen, and it appeared to be a robbery and murder. Kaharu Ginsaku (Tomokazu Miura), head of the First Investigative Division at the Ehime Prefectural Police Headquarters, who was in charge of the investigation, did not anticipate that this case would turn out to be an unexpectedly difficult case. At the end of that year, in a forest overlooking the Genkai Sea in Karatsu City, Saga Prefecture, Kyushu, Kazuo Shimosaka (Shiro Sano) puts his hands around the neck of his girlfriend, Nobuko Mano (Saki Takaoka), and strangles her to death.","popularity":0.7311,"poster_path":"/vsKTkJnIfG0XRqqB9aqgRLXJwGR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88543,"logo_path":null,"name":"CAL","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2005-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Passed Scene","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"松本清張サスペンス 渡された場面","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Watasareta bamen","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Matsumoto Seicho Suspense The Passed Scene","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomokazu Miura","original_name":"三浦友和","popularity":0.9632,"profile_path":"/2tKusMF6dzGOfH7MM73FCsJzRoJ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ginsaku Kawara","credit_id":"66f18daf2d98d59ce13b0cee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirō Sano","original_name":"佐野史郎","popularity":0.7928,"profile_path":"/pdPx52iDMEkramZZYnwh1VIP7jq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Kazuo Shimosaka","credit_id":"66f18dbcde2d52dfbd8d35f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4958591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saki Takaoka","original_name":"Saki Takaoka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Nobuko","credit_id":"66f18dc9a82b005703269f1c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saburo Ishikura","original_name":"石倉三郎","popularity":0.5653,"profile_path":"/dGA2VnbwUIP6qed2aRAycKpCAsX.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ochi","credit_id":"66f18dd9de2d52dfbd8d361d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":228081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naomi Akimoto","original_name":"秋本奈緒美","popularity":0.3795,"profile_path":"/5M2Mt2dNYf1a1ZHafVReZIfFe0A.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Keiko","credit_id":"66f18df0a82b005703269f4f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1189711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenjirō Nashimoto","original_name":"梨本謙次郎","popularity":0.2423,"profile_path":"/4sNqfzQppb3R0k7hFbOo2kx2wOU.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Goichi Koga","credit_id":"66f18e00a82b005703269f6c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2164025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soganoya Bundo","original_name":"曽我廼家文童","popularity":0.1373,"profile_path":"/jX676FStHMvydw8TjZ9bvNWkZ1G.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Lt.
