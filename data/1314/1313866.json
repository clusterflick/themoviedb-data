He filmed it provoked by the teasing of Belgrade moviegoers who claimed that “mostly eating and drinking is done in the Split cinema club”, which was not far from the truth. Still, the wounded pride and anger took their toll, and in 1960 he filmed his first “Split” film — Meštrović (The Exaltation of Matter) with which he succeeded. At the international film festival in Vienna, he received a UNICA bronze plaque, the first international award received by amateur cinematography in Yugoslavia at the time.","popularity":0.1096,"poster_path":"/zz5ZJLzB0R6MG4a4Xpt5QmJt2eg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18797,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kino Klub Split","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mestrovic - Exaltation of Matter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1568095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Martinac","original_name":"Ivan Martinac","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/c7u4TTzrUyqSfhQBhT0ezjX4zNc.jpg","credit_id":"668a7a0145bcbdc5d15e3db1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1568095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Martinac","original_name":"Ivan Martinac","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/c7u4TTzrUyqSfhQBhT0ezjX4zNc.jpg","credit_id":"66a9426456de99d36ae3abd3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/20UxdwAGI4fAg2D0uY7WT8vvdN2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zz5ZJLzB0R6MG4a4Xpt5QmJt2eg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
