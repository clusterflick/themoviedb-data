The idea entitled is the early stage of foetal development, the point when the foetus can become either male or female, so it’s a hermaphroditic stage. Somehow that had something to do with this person making a choice, a decision. Could go both ways, in a spiritual sense. I lost the film, and I expect it was rather ambiguous anyway. It was more or less an excuse to make some visuals and had images of church architecture, religious statues and things. I think it was influenced throughout by Gregory Markopoulos’ films.” (George Landow, interviewed by Tony Reveaux, 1977)","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Stringent Prediction at the Early Hermaphroditic Stage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Owen Land","original_name":"Owen Land","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/liamsqKEYvHLZFnHGTgvMdUoJbo.jpg","credit_id":"6689e7b806b87f46985e2aa8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12162384","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
