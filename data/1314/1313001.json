He has landed a job as a receptionist at Adonis, Copenhagen's only gay sauna, where he not only works but also gathers his very personal experiences and encounters with the sauna's other guests. For Johan, the city is like a boundless paradise of opportunities with bars, parties, and one-night stands, but it is only when he meets the transgender William that he experiences love up close. The love between the two is put to a tough test, as is often the case when living in a society governed by rigid ideas about gender, love, and identity.","popularity":1.0295,"poster_path":"/r8fPHy3iifUljHwipycxh5XLY4h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143164,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nordisk Film","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2025-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sauna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2642049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magnus Juhl Andersen","original_name":"Magnus Juhl Andersen","popularity":0.1125,"profile_path":"/6g2NOzo7AbQog39exY02grndUqv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66879999fca4e0724f9eb530","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2175705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Rask","original_name":"Nina Rask","popularity":0.4326,"profile_path":"/bYRMMYdw9EWoID54jRE8hxNIjFk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"668799a2cd5bfcb502a36a8a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3410909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dilan Amin","original_name":"Dilan Amin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"668799a959f524f59bd4dc0e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1036401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Tange","original_name":"Klaus Tange","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":"/ipxyyO67vLQKtVJOBJMfsocBF8X.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"668799b5fca4e0724f9eb534","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Oliver Hansen","original_name":"Peter Oliver Hansen","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":"/pTY1fYcXJ23liKwSfayco6p8Xr9.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"668799bc7f5ee970b4936bda","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2361843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morten Burian","original_name":"Morten Burian","popularity":0.1448,"profile_path":"/tS9HnCx8cHaoLLruGxbti4xkzkm.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"668799e024e6311e58d4daf5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4811623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billie N.
