Because he has opened a branch office in Taipei, he meets a resident singer, Fang Qi, and they fall in love. Tao Kai decides to divorce his wife, Pei Wen, but he never expects that Fang Qi's sister and Pei Wen's father have an unusual relationship and that Fang Qi's sister will end her life because of her shame to Pei Wen. Fangqi's sister ended her life because she was ashamed of Peiwen, and Fangqi needed to recuperate for a short time because she was too stimulated. At that time, Peiwen also lost her eyesight because of her eye problem. Tao Kai went back to see Peiwen, and Fangqi also left. After three years, Tao Kai went back to visit Pei Wen again, but he didn't realise that Pei Wen was still waiting for him. Tao Kai had no face to go back and said goodbye to Pei Wen.","popularity":0.3535,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":233152,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crystal Art (H.K.)
