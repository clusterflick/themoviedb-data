A dialog develops between the two and the scenes of everyday bonarense life. Maia is directly confronted with a femicide in her circle of friends for the first time, while Piqui has been involved in activist struggles and forms of self-organization in the neighbourhood for decades. Play, humor and music are the connecting moments between daughter and father in their struggles for justice. The film tells a story between Shakira and political subjectivation.","popularity":0.0685,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":117,"logo_path":"/twj6GjwWKt23x21fkxItt7v7lEQ.png","name":"Kunsthochschule für Medien Köln","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maia & Piqui","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","title":"Maia y Piqui","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4815502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kathrin Dröppelmann","original_name":"Kathrin Dröppelmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668a6b24d151de804c1832ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4815499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ada Kopaz","original_name":"Ada Kopaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668a6a88b28cd5c7d60c98d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
