He runs into Pigmeat on the street and asks for the money he's owed, but Pigmeat winds up convincing him that not only does he not owe Shorty any salary, but he actually overpays Shorty $1.25 a week. Later, Shorty reads about a jewel thief on the loose in Harlem and that there's a reward of $1,000 for his capture. He convinces Pigmeat that the two of them can catch this guy, collect the reward and then become famous detectives. Complications ensue.","popularity":0.7209,"poster_path":"/x9imOtH3LGyYkab6Ci4s9tBzLw3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1946-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House-Rent Party","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1244600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dewey 'Pigmeat' Markham","original_name":"Dewey 'Pigmeat' Markham","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":"/oYV1eLHsvDiu0o33uBaE6qIndIL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66899ea0c0862abeead50d6e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3682903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John 'Rastus' Murray","original_name":"John 'Rastus' Murray","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6689ad1074e74254f80c6f37","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4814642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Cortez","original_name":"Alfred Cortez","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6689ad2c9b24a7a22357c3d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2375855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Bethea","original_name":"David Bethea","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nappy","credit_id":"6689ad448b90aaf73d57d23f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2375859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudy Toombs","original_name":"Rudy Toombs","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6689ad75fca4e0724f9ef330","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4814645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"The Lord Invader","original_name":"The Lord Invader","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The Lord Invader","credit_id":"6689adc0de1a48cf6ba388db","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4814648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Macbeth's Calypso Band","original_name":"Macbeth's Calypso Band","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6689ae0faebc538376012034","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3682904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberta Pryne","original_name":"Alberta Pryne","popularity":0.0861,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6689ae2837208713aa890905","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4814649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hannah Sylvester","original_name":"Hannah Sylvester","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6689ae3f00e4a57c660844e4","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4814650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Demetri","original_name":"Claude Demetri","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6689ae5133bb8c986b57ce22","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2707668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lou Swarz","original_name":"Lou Swarz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6689ae64fc971884cd0120ae","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4814653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kay Freeman","original_name":"Kay Freeman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6689aecd0a0caebd98180f26","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4814655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James McNeely","original_name":"James McNeely","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"6689aedf345f4c7a890c6f3a","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Newfield","original_name":"Sam Newfield","popularity":0.6187,"profile_path":"/4SXjJuEUwmCLOfl9RKXqz0yO2dx.jpg","credit_id":"66899e2433ad8b552151054f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0135460","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/x9imOtH3LGyYkab6Ci4s9tBzLw3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5941,"name":"calypso"},{"id":10123,"name":"dark comedy"},{"id":157768,"name":"vaudeville"},{"id":194610,"name":"variety show"},{"id":256015,"name":"african american"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1946-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
