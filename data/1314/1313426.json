Their trip goes relatively smoothly until they encounter an abandoned railway tunnel; the sole obstacle between them and their neighbourhood. Two of the teens, Rosalia and Evan, suggest they push on, but their friend Tay senses something amiss. Her suspicions end up being proven right, as first Rosalia, and then Evan, disappear in the darkness of the tunnel. One year later, Tay returns in search of answers.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":"/cLu0qGRZZ1CP0FAjEPaa8o5nNIT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Don't look back.","title":"Tunnel Vision","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4813580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amelie Lattik","original_name":"Amelie Lattik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Tay","credit_id":"668903146f5bd0014ccb70bc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4813581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zahira Kayrooz","original_name":"Zahira Kayrooz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Rosalia","credit_id":"668903217ade88fd36648323","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4813582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Goudie-Park","original_name":"Sam Goudie-Park","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Evan","credit_id":"668903310797712e70cb70f2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4813583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isla Faulds","original_name":"Isla Faulds","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Ghost","credit_id":"6689033cc630184d0e648cb0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4813584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arlo Morgan","original_name":"Arlo Morgan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668903517d44309c7d08319d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4813584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arlo Morgan","original_name":"Arlo Morgan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6689035ff5c4b16dda5e221c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3084736,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bill Missett","original_name":"Bill Missett","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668903926d8ce0f1429eddb0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4813584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arlo Morgan","original_name":"Arlo Morgan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6689037795d2799e085e142d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4813585,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Josh Macphee","original_name":"Josh Macphee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668903a200e4a57c66083f6d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4291182,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Denis Feletto","original_name":"Denis Feletto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668903bc89f32481d9499f56","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4813584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arlo Morgan","original_name":"Arlo Morgan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6689036a5a1a19b746648ed7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32850500","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cLu0qGRZZ1CP0FAjEPaa8o5nNIT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315058,"name":"horror"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"tunnel vision - supernatural horror short film (2023)","key":"g8chOBeD1oA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-11-08T02:00:30.000Z","id":"6689047dc75a8c9b14a38085"}]}}}
