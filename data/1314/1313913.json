Craving the play follows a young woman whose hunger for life leads her out of high school to Europe for a year of adventure. The wonder and excitement of the young woman in Europe contrast with her downward spiral as she struggles with anorexia. At a low of 69 pounds, she realizes that her hunger for life can not co-exist with physical starvation, and she begins her road to recovery. The short film version of Craving adds yet another layer: it is told from the unique perspective of an expectant mother - a recovered anorexic - in her final weeks of pregnancy.","popularity":0.1338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":233199,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chrysalis Filmworks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2005-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Craving","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4815833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jasmine Atkins","original_name":"Jasmine Atkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Young Delphine","credit_id":"668a940f8a80320225892d2a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4815834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eliza Brooker Filipchuk","original_name":"Eliza Brooker Filipchuk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Baby","credit_id":"668a942167e1b52c3c1d32e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4815835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon-Paul Khouri","original_name":"Jon-Paul Khouri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"French Person (voice)","credit_id":"668a9438a363cb68e46184f2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2896683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delphine Brooker","original_name":"Delphine Brooker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"668a94d634a543904f1d2a79","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1586331,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kirk Chiswell","original_name":"Kirk Chiswell","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668a9516a4086a7a770c8f89","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christianne Hirt","original_name":"Christianne Hirt","popularity":0.371,"profile_path":"/rgcuJp1U7kJ5zKG8OwsUtfW59pk.jpg","credit_id":"668a94581ece824e3a57e4cc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4815838,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joshua Tidsbury","original_name":"Joshua Tidsbury","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668a94ebf1a15ebcf13fd48a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2896683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delphine Brooker","original_name":"Delphine Brooker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668a94c0806853c8763fd40b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christianne Hirt","original_name":"Christianne Hirt","popularity":0.371,"profile_path":"/rgcuJp1U7kJ5zKG8OwsUtfW59pk.jpg","credit_id":"668a94894e5727f33a34df08","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christianne Hirt","original_name":"Christianne Hirt","popularity":0.371,"profile_path":"/rgcuJp1U7kJ5zKG8OwsUtfW59pk.jpg","credit_id":"668a9462f5c4b16dda5e51f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2896683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delphine Brooker","original_name":"Delphine Brooker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668a94aab9f6befaeb1836bd","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4815841,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mitch Barany","original_name":"Mitch Barany","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668a952a13c06906a35e4d55","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0790805","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
