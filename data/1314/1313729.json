Internal styles place great emphasis on Qigong (exercises devoting to cultivate the vital life energy or Qi within the body). Sun style is especially effective for healing, relieving stress and building internal energy. It is characterized by agile steps, whenever one foot moves the other follows. The movements are smooth like flowing water in a river.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Characterized by powerful Qigong exercises, agile steps and flowing movements","title":"Sun Style Tai Chi - 73 Forms","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
