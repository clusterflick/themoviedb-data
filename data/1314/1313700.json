The Suffolk Strangler is a documentary that reveals how DNA evidence helped to ultimately convict the murderer who claimed more victims than The Yorkshire Ripper or even Jack the Ripper in the short time he was at large.  In this access-led documentary exclusive interviews are featured with the prosecutors and police who worked to catch and convict the Suffolk serial killer, Steven Wright. Family members and close friends of the murdered girls also tell their stories alongside this gripping and tragic true-crime narrative.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Suffolk Strangler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
