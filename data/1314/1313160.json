Paper is cut and distributed inside an enclosed space that seems to contain no exit. Something wild and unknown enters with the appearance of a bird and a vegetative green color.  When time passes during the making process, it forges a deeper connection within the maker: time transfixes into timelessness for its creator.  Through “making,” a new world is birthed and inhabits the space as the artist-maker disappears and leaves what remains behind to the viewer.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PAPER DOOR","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2971411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lili White","original_name":"Lili White","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66880e00749f4d950288de65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
