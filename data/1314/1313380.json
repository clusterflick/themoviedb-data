Borrowing from the language of cosmetics advertisement, mass media and Thai soap opera, the work addresses questions around voice and speech in the context of the recent mobilisations in Bangkok. Using sound synthesis, Niyomkarn contrasts melodic parallels between the Thai anthem and the popular song 'Golden Land’ with dialogues and conversations ripped from and recorded in global protest events. Drawing on these sonic granularities, Chulayarnnon folds digital noise into an otherwise common manifestation of a capitalised gendered division of affects, intimacy and politics in contemporary Thailand.","popularity":0.049,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Methylene Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3131756,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Liew Niyomkarn","original_name":"Liew Niyomkarn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6688d2620cb0e470ea57ba81","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1887347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chulayarnnon Siriphol","original_name":"Chulayarnnon Siriphol","popularity":0.2174,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6688d1810797712e70cb6ddb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"th","note":"SONIC CONTINUUM, a part of the festival A House in Many Parts, collaboration with Liew Niyomkarn, commissioned by Sofia Lemos, for the multi-platform research programme, JAM café, Bangkok, Thailand","release_date":"2020-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
