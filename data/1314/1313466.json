Sharing with them her life experiences, she sheds light on her unique painting style informed by her rebellion against the philistine upbringing in the suburbs of Cologne. By capturing Pia Antonia Klinkhammer's works on 16mm film, accompanied by her son's music, the students create what eventually becomes her only lifetime solo exhibition.","popularity":0.2187,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":117,"logo_path":"/twj6GjwWKt23x21fkxItt7v7lEQ.png","name":"Kunsthochschule für Medien Köln","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Confessions of Pia Antonia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4813760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pia Antonia Klinkhammer","original_name":"Pia Antonia Klinkhammer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66892d22815b98512118004a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2296079,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Artem Zavadovsky","original_name":"Artem Zavadovsky","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66892cdb67e1b52c3c1d09fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4813758,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Janis Klinkhammer","original_name":"Janis Klinkhammer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66892d03aa9de161899ee25b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":227302,"name":"portrait of an artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
