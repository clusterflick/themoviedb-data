Gazbabali is a mountainous village with only a primary school. To continue their education, pupils must travel to the neighboring village of Amirkhanli. However, due to poverty, the long distance, and the lack of infrastructure most parents cannot afford to send their children for further education. The situation is especially dire for girls - safety concerns further limit educational opportunities for girls. As a result, most girls are unable to continue their education beyond the fourth grade, curtailing their opportunities for personal and professional growth.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/iileiNdCyMBAILiHSgPl0kZ0udH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","name":"Azerbaijan"}],"release_date":"2024-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Azərbaycan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Childhood in remote","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iileiNdCyMBAILiHSgPl0kZ0udH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"az","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
