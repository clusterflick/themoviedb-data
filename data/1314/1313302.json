In this work, the chemical element hydrogen, which is present in practically everything and everyone, and which is common but at the same time destructive, traces a path between the film's fields of thought, mainly as an agent of desire in the poetry of Brazilian Augusto dos Anjos. The poem \"Soliloquy of a Visionary\" structures the video between the review of what was the multiple, and the questioning of what can give substance to the suffix \"tude\".","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lG5X1YvrEqfzcgh6xkX00gf9bNy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Multi-tude","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2868346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernando Moletta","original_name":"Fernando Moletta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66886cf7bd498b87445f5576","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lG5X1YvrEqfzcgh6xkX00gf9bNy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
