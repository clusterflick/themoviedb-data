This project was born from the observation that the speech of Gazans is difficult to hear, that It is necessary to have traces of what is experienced so that the memory is preserved, so that the history of the occupation of Palestine cannot be rewritten without taking into account that of the Palestinians and particularly those of Gaza. In this context, it is not easy to imagine a thriving creative space and yet it exists. The Gaza Strip has its artistic talents, which nothing should stop creating. This is how the idea was born of composing a 60-minute film with around twenty very short stories, each lasting three minutes on average. This allows for a multiplicity of points of view, guarantees the feasibility of filming, which is necessarily short and dispersed throughout the space of the Gaza Strip.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ground Zero","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
