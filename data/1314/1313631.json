With undying kindness and optimism, she visits all her clients, providing them with mental and physical comfort. She has a fifteen-year-old daughter, but she is aware that she is unable to give her the time she deserves. And then there is Alvar, a sick man who desperately needs care and support – things his illness prevents him from asking for. Who Stands Up for Alvar is a critique of an overburdened welfare system that drains caregivers of valuable energy they could be devoting to their clients, as well as a poignant look at the need for “ordinary” human kindness.
