For almost 40 years between 1969 and 2007, a total of over a quarter-of-a-million soldiers served on the streets of Northern Ireland in 'Operation Banner', the British Army's longest ever operation. These men and women were at the heart of the key events of the conflict, with over 700 soldiers killed and more than 6,000 injured, and a further 305 deaths attributed to them. Squaddies on the Frontline is their story, taking viewers into the heart of 'Operation Banner' and the day-to-day realities of life and work here as a soldier through some of the toughest years of the Troubles, looking at the impact that it had, and continues to have, on their lives and the lives of those around them, both in Northern Ireland and beyond.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/8X11FQaISgMyBLHbzayUg6Rduom.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101887,"logo_path":null,"name":"Open Reel","origin_country":""},{"id":20639,"logo_path":"/qypOd6AlNrfHIXN9nArZmyMv6do.png","name":"BBC Northern Ireland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Squaddies on the Frontline","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1993313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vinny Cunningham","original_name":"Vinny Cunningham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa172920e0a2644e700bd47","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1993313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vinny Cunningham","original_name":"Vinny Cunningham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa172ad0e0a2644e900ddbf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1993312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Peto","original_name":"John Peto","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa1727f0e0a2644dd00b90a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1993312,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Peto","original_name":"John Peto","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa172a0925141610500a86b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8X11FQaISgMyBLHbzayUg6Rduom.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
