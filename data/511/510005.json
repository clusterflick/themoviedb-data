Guided by a mythological character, Kheiron the Centaur, she travels freely between the ruins of an ancient Roman hospital and the streets of a mountain village, high above the river Euphrates. Time and space become dislocated, opening up passages between worlds. An inner experience translated into a film poem, KAZARKEN explores memory as a place of struggle against oblivion and the violence of hidden history.","popularity":0.0887,"poster_path":"/2i8ZnV6N4u9JCu4wogwUseY4Pxk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kazarken: As We Dig","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1992866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Güldem Durmaz","original_name":"Güldem Durmaz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"La femme","credit_id":"5aa0c3cd0e0a2644ed0002f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Lavant","original_name":"Denis Lavant","popularity":0.2932,"profile_path":"/WgGsHm3IC6ocjmjslREvKKNnX3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Chiron, le centaure","credit_id":"5aa0c3e80e0a2644e90003ca","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1992866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Güldem Durmaz","original_name":"Güldem Durmaz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa0c5b9c3a368509e000533","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1992866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Güldem Durmaz","original_name":"Güldem Durmaz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa0c39cc3a368506b000340","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1505019,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Simon Backès","original_name":"Simon Backès","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa0c3b79251416105000325","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6332598","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2i8ZnV6N4u9JCu4wogwUseY4Pxk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Torino Film Festival","release_date":"2016-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
