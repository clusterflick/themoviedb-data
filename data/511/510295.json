In 2015 he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. This feature length documentary charts Mclean's struggle to carry on working as the disease takes hold. He proves to be an engaging, humorous and always fascinating companion as he allows us access to that most private of spaces; the artist's studio. Parkinson's gradually locks him into disability but he heroically and resolutely refuses to give up on his paintings.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Which Way Up With John McLean","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6820080","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
