It tackles issues of identity, displacement, the spectre of comparison, 2nd class citizenship, nationality and the privileged position of belonging in the academe, all disguised in the everyday struggles of sustaining a long distance relationship. Seen from the point of view of the one who writes to a lover left behind, (Mahal, 2017) serves as a reference to the daily battles of a scholar who is burdened with the choice of reconciling the need to find solutions to the social problems of her country and the desire to live a reactionary life with the person she loves.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/c0cw11vQasqMqxcy30yTStbvRtd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2018-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The lives of Filipinos in Europe, as narrated through an OFW’s love letter.","title":"Love, 2017","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1994130,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Janine Patricia Santos","original_name":"Janine Patricia Santos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa2a74ac3a36829a100d798","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1994130,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Janine Patricia Santos","original_name":"Janine Patricia Santos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa2a756c3a36829b800d2f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1994132,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mari Jeanie Derillo","original_name":"Mari Jeanie Derillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa2a7680e0a262c7400d59b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1994133,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hussein Butoyi","original_name":"Hussein Butoyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa2a77b0e0a262c7700e770","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3PFNDYihKtK8XmsAwQF8gJLH6i8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1366}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":757,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c0cw11vQasqMqxcy30yTStbvRtd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":508},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eiG2guXXIzGUpARDIUUykF1peUC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
