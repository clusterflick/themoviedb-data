With the cathedral-like majesty of the Large Hadron Collider as his theatre, a modern physicist searches for the smallest primordial particle and discovers a love without end. SYMMETRY UNRAVELLED is the accompanying documentary about the collision of art and science in the world's largest machine: the particle accelerator. Complementing the dance-opera film SYMMETRY, a common curiosity at the crux of man's fascination with the unknown is revealed.","popularity":0.0604,"poster_path":"/aZo2DbRuu0TyNlBQa6vhc5V3IjE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Symmetry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Ellis","original_name":"John Ellis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/60NgCZybnk8WRixxXVYl7g86Mv7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Theoretical Physicist","credit_id":"65aaf0217caa47012b099502","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1995722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruben van Leer","original_name":"Ruben van Leer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa49f4c0e0a260760017c32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4662934","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bD4SvbQAyGYftg6NzKBVDNQai7S.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8t18eN47rlGaen1yDQkeuk3iQlA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7o3l1mm3ZLXjq43BB3wBj1LVs0Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":10.588,"height":177,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hU3Xzjdk7ZxbiAvrlYi2y2rGzx2.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1874}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aZo2DbRuu0TyNlBQa6vhc5V3IjE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vzoPV8qJKxwWZKCYrxGHiJ5x06v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
