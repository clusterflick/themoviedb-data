Since the country was colonized in 1880, the blasts left Tahitians picking through the remnants of their islands and culture in an effort to keep indigenous knowledges alive. The film offers a poetic glimpse into contemporary Tahiti, and the colonial struggles its people still face as they strive to sustain their way of life.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":"/zYeeZGnTw5KggBNXW01DzdjJmib.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"PF","name":"French Polynesia"}],"release_date":"2018-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Tahitian","iso_639_1":"ty","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ma'ohi Nui: In the Heart of the Ocean My Country Lies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"MA'OHI NUI, au coeur de l'océan mon pays","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2766179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flora Devatine","original_name":"Flora Devatine","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f528550c740d900339217b1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2403808,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Annick Ghijzelings","original_name":"Annick Ghijzelings","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/brNEKomKnkMM4MKMm9XpatyDI7z.jpg","credit_id":"5f347511111da1003663df12","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2403808,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Annick Ghijzelings","original_name":"Annick Ghijzelings","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/brNEKomKnkMM4MKMm9XpatyDI7z.jpg","credit_id":"5f34752af6fd180037287208","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769734,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Caroline Guimbal","original_name":"Caroline Guimbal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9xjwYRgQznFOZsHHRN9fgQoidwF.jpg","credit_id":"5f528454ec18790035f9c896","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1500589,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Isabelle Truc","original_name":"Isabelle Truc","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f528447c740d900339214b2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2403808,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Annick Ghijzelings","original_name":"Annick Ghijzelings","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/brNEKomKnkMM4MKMm9XpatyDI7z.jpg","credit_id":"5f52845ce894a6003851da6d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2403808,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Annick Ghijzelings","original_name":"Annick Ghijzelings","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/brNEKomKnkMM4MKMm9XpatyDI7z.jpg","credit_id":"5f528441498ef90035a7f374","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7508988","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.733,"height":905,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zYeeZGnTw5KggBNXW01DzdjJmib.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":663}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
