For over fifty years, Rams has left an indelible mark on the field of product design with his iconic work at Braun and Vitsoe, and his influence on Apple. So at 86 years old, why does he now regret being a designer? RAMS is a design documentary, but it’s also a rumination on consumerism, materialism, and sustainability. Dieter's philosophy is about more than just design, it’s about a way to live. The film also features an original score by pioneering musician Brian Eno.","popularity":0.9495,"poster_path":"/7TggLi1Pb2NLTXzVwK70JW1feB7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20778,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Film
