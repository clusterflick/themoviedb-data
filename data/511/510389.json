Emma is now a pop culture loving, rom com obsessed, Zen seeking Wiccan lesbian living in New York City and working in a magic shop called Enchantments. In this re-telling of Jane Austen's classic we see bi-racial families and relationships and lgbtq relationships and realize that love is love. It doesn't matter how one loves, as long as it's true. It's a shiny, happy, campy love story like you've never seen before.","popularity":0.0845,"poster_path":"/mcpIUD2VquZYIxBdvl9EPN28knY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enchantments","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1543949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelsey O'Brien","original_name":"Kelsey O'Brien","popularity":0.0731,"profile_path":"/6Yucui2PWBn9hO6Xihm7PW33p5I.jpg","credit_id":"5aa23c679251414c5a0066cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3176586","wikidata_id":"Q30749144","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mcpIUD2VquZYIxBdvl9EPN28knY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
