Our society imbues a man's testicles with the constructs of masculinity, sexuality, virility and overall male-hood. So what happens when a man is faced with losing one or both? There are four main incidents that can lead a man to be faced with the removal of a ball - testicular cancer, torsion, an infection, or gender reassignment. An exploration around the decision to replace or not replace, options of replacements, dating and disclosure, parenthood possibilities, and likely most importantly the psychology surrounding moving forward without feeling emasculated make Balls well rounded, talk-worthy, and shareable.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/sbS83en106VU9wB0IBcDtSOEK0o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Balls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356872,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nickolaos Stagias","original_name":"Nickolaos Stagias","popularity":0.0991,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aa5b678c3a3687c0c02c0ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5545960","wikidata_id":"Q26899867","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sbS83en106VU9wB0IBcDtSOEK0o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
