In between a young ingénue cast in her first big role, the Hoffmann rehearsals, the theatre director and his stage director exchanging cynicisms, a budding love affair. Gründgens at his most repulsive, trying to woo both lovers. And a hair-raising finale. Add to this some snappy dialogue and \"pre-code\" scenes that make you sit up and stare.","popularity":0.1445,"poster_path":"/yhVcuhxgaj377CU8I41sUvp5040.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89292,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carl Froelich-Film
