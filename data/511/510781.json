Mike Connors, publicity man for Frankie Carle's orchestra, invites her to try out as the band's vocalist since the regular singer, Mary Lou, had just quit the band on the eve of an engagement at a swanky New York night club. Encouraged by her boyfriend, Steve Roberts, Ann lands the job and assumes the name of \"Mary Lou\", a trademark almost for Frankie Carle singers. But the departed Mary Lou shows up and threatens to sue if she is not rehired. Ann returns to her former job. Meanwhile, Steve locates the woman who was the original Mary Lou with the band, and urges Mike to keep the current Mary Lou off the bandstand until he can return with Ann.","popularity":0.5942,"poster_path":"/lQ0j5jpyZLFCsiUkdWDLOnSh9WZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From Airline Hostess To Hot-Spot Songstress!","title":"Mary Lou","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lowery","original_name":"Robert Lowery","popularity":0.1636,"profile_path":"/8wS1z1Di0lHQBHu6zOA75SUtJGN.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Steve Roberts","credit_id":"5aa4c61a0e0a2607510193d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":88681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Barton","original_name":"Joan Barton","popularity":0.0949,"profile_path":"/2iDaXQ9rD74WlcRcxJwtb1aiy89.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ann Parker, aka Mary Lou","credit_id":"5aa4c628c3a3687bff01d9bc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenda Farrell","original_name":"Glenda Farrell","popularity":0.2628,"profile_path":"/xBaAWMgCzVpzMzK2bmA8bkmSGm2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Winnie Winford","credit_id":"5aa4c637c3a3687bff01d9ce","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Jenks","original_name":"Frank Jenks","popularity":0.2326,"profile_path":"/8ieh8cQUfXmK6W7vhn84wOPC5AC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mike Connors","credit_id":"5aa4c651c3a3687bfc01dbb1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thelma White","original_name":"Thelma White","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/r3M4I48naR5QEGDPEdQBczaEg6e.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Eve Summers","credit_id":"5aa4c66a925141278401a2e3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abigail Adams","original_name":"Abigail Adams","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/xmThwtib86EnamS2ifxlDJZzZbD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"First Mary Lou","credit_id":"5aa4c6450e0a26075a01d765","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chester Clute","original_name":"Chester Clute","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":"/e7gTZGvxMoZ4P3947oW8mAmLamK.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Cheever Chesney","credit_id":"5aa4c69b925141278701a92e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmett Vogan","original_name":"Emmett Vogan","popularity":0.2487,"profile_path":"/gKDRfOG9zZ5lOrNceUSIDI4ZbUh.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Murray Harris","credit_id":"5aa4c65c0e0a26075a01d77d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Watkin","original_name":"Pierre Watkin","popularity":0.2036,"profile_path":"/w36vNJFvQDiDyuC9zvT8nNZajhA.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Airline President","credit_id":"5aa4c675925141277e01a244","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Jordan","original_name":"Charles Jordan","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/29xaLlK2VIGn2AmNtAxUOFK3kHm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mortimer Cripps","credit_id":"5aa4c680925141279001a71a","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frankie Carle","original_name":"Frankie Carle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Band Leader Frankie Carle (as Frankie Carle and His Piano)","credit_id":"5aa4c6bd925141277e01a284","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Abbott","original_name":"George Abbott","popularity":0.2473,"profile_path":"/43Tj83RQFgWCkTgpDAgRcbkyqaZ.jpg","credit_id":"5bfdf28f925141108003a6bd","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Abbott","original_name":"George Abbott","popularity":0.2473,"profile_path":"/43Tj83RQFgWCkTgpDAgRcbkyqaZ.jpg","credit_id":"5bfdf2719251411329037092","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024197,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"M.
