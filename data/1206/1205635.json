Mother and daughter clash, leading Grace to attempt to mourn in isolation. Confronted by memories of happier times, she begins the process of cleansing the house - and herself - of the medical paraphernalia of the sick man she nursed. Ignoring phone calls from her daughter, she chaotically extends the purge of George's earthly manifestations beyond what she can bear. Faced with her error, she has a choice to make - to either continue on her destructive path, or reach out to her daughter for help.","popularity":0.6747,"poster_path":"/mHNJGXsHsKB6UnDZPZDsR0WTExb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call Me Back","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lindsay Duncan","original_name":"Lindsay Duncan","popularity":1.4172,"profile_path":"/sgyf4vOUs5KlRmp4Uuw7UXKjU2b.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Grace","credit_id":"65550fe3ac4161011ef845bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophia Myles","original_name":"Sophia Myles","popularity":1.1015,"profile_path":"/1WCCEfFzDYxBkBxCgGEApP4cwMn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lucy","credit_id":"65550ff053866e0139e1cc12","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Broadbent","original_name":"Jim Broadbent","popularity":1.9528,"profile_path":"/s7lXYfrsJoGA4vKmyv61SPgABmR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"George","credit_id":"65551011d4fe0400ac363084","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3009455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Andrews","original_name":"Tom Andrews","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65550ed5b5400200fed95129","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3009455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Andrews","original_name":"Tom Andrews","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65550fa40816c700e0192163","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4378692,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Micki Colker-Pearlman","original_name":"Micki Colker-Pearlman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65550ee2b5400200ac985f37","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26403464","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mHNJGXsHsKB6UnDZPZDsR0WTExb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"North East International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Sheffield Global Cinema Festival","release_date":"2023-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
