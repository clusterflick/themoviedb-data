He was cut across the left cheek during a fight when he was young, earning him the moniker \"Scarface.\" He moved to Chicago in 1919 and worked with infamous gangster Johnny Torrio to help run illicit operations there. In the Roaring Twenties, Al Capone ruled an empire of crime in the Windy City: gambling, prostitution, bootlegging, bribery, narcotics trafficking, robbery, \"protection\" rackets, and murder. And it seemed that law enforcement couldn't touch him. That was until one fatal night in 1929.","popularity":0.2798,"poster_path":"/vLZts3wINtQnZHtKxk2Ikxn3Uh0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Entertain Me Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scarface: The Al Capone Story","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4542229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristofer Allerfeldt","original_name":"Kristofer Allerfeldt","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65d101df22df2e017c2c0cf6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4542230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Hernández","original_name":"Miguel Hernández","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65d101f341eee1017c08404e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3073085,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Finlay Bald","original_name":"Finlay Bald","popularity":0.203,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d1023aa06645016319450b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29088467","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1218,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vLZts3wINtQnZHtKxk2Ikxn3Uh0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":821}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
