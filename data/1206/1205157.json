The program aimed to redistribute white-owned farmland to Zimbabweans across cultural boundaries, and was often accompanied by violence. Two decades later, a young white Zimbabwean woman reflects on her childhood experiences during the primary years of the land invasions and the lasting effects on her family, as well as the persistent racism within the white farming community.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/oo4ANN8bx0ux4SBb4BE1dnoxqW6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2022-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land Changes Hands, but the Bees Remain in the Hive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2536041,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Horn","original_name":"Roger Horn","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gNpISi2yBsm7K7oftncxt1tsa98.jpg","credit_id":"6553c8780816c700fd2f48ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oo4ANN8bx0ux4SBb4BE1dnoxqW6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Clermont-Ferrand Short Film Festival - Short Film Market Pick","release_date":"2022-01-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Analogica Selection","release_date":"2023-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
