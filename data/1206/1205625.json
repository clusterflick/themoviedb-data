Drawing on references to that history, the 2003 Darfur genocide, and the American South, she uses silhouettes, a nineteenth-century portrait technique, to reflect on issues of identity, race, and violence.  The brightly colored backgrounds and country-inflected banjo soundtrack create a sense of spectacle that is at odds with the violence experienced by the figures, reminding viewers that images of black bodies in pain continue to be a source of entertainment under white supremacy.
