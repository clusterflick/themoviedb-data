You'll enjoy the escapades of  Peabody-Jones as he braves the frontier in search of adventure  and finds a life of danger as well as rewards. It takes a miner's  ghost, a mysterious parcel and finally the U.S. Cavalry to bring  the story to a happy ending. A recommended featurette,  with an excellent and original soundtrack score, but very  difficult to find.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/kHUL9Xn0lurlsIOnyFHLeo2N39r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":213550,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lincoln
