Down at the end of That Road, if you get out and walk to the edge of the ravine, down a rabbit trail to the right, you can get down one way and enter the treeline. Deep deep in those woods is the Bone House. Too many strange characters to count call this vortex home. Poke around the woods, watch for odd luring lights and sounds. Or, if you dare, peek in some windows. Nobody, nobody takes the front door... it doesn't lead where you think.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Welcome to the BONE HOUSE!","title":"HAUNTED BONE HOUSE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"HAUNTED BONE HOUSE ðŸ’€ðŸ‘»Best 4K Immersive Experience with Jump Scare, Music & Ambience! 2.5 HR!","key":"G5BOadO4HXs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-10-28T01:00:21.000Z","id":"655447f7ea84c710910b4c2c"}]}}}
