During these days he collected the visions and insights that went on to be very influential in his thinking and shaped some of the most important works of his literary career. The images and sounds of this film were shot there and are a homage to this cave and its possible invocations.  Grotta is part of Fieldworks, an ongoing experiment with ambient video and radio frequencies.","popularity":0.1814,"poster_path":"/zgqTXpvM9KtWwnUTVae9nIDKwKz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2023-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grotta","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4376477,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Duccio Maggiora","original_name":"Duccio Maggiora","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6553a265ea84c71096dc4dd9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2745569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Félix Fattal","original_name":"Félix Fattal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/6jeU84N9ysElbdEWhpBDX4GuRpq.jpg","credit_id":"6553a21cac416100e33cab16","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2745569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Félix Fattal","original_name":"Félix Fattal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/6jeU84N9ysElbdEWhpBDX4GuRpq.jpg","credit_id":"6553a229ac4161011ef7a669","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170724,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Casas","original_name":"Carlos Casas","popularity":0.0918,"profile_path":"/psABqoL4Ja4j6o5FdvBNc4TrGK9.jpg","credit_id":"6553a206903c5200fe63aca0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1938000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefano Miraglia","original_name":"Stefano Miraglia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/enaORN7QrbIINK8suJdV1SfK8X5.jpg","credit_id":"6553a2120816c700e0187670","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925927,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yannig Willmann","original_name":"Yannig Willmann","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6553a23aac4161011ef7a670","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4376475,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alexis Walbecq","original_name":"Alexis Walbecq","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6553a24bac4161013b4a0b7a","department":"Crew","job":"Intern"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zgqTXpvM9KtWwnUTVae9nIDKwKz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1964,"name":"cave"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":209457,"name":"ticino"},{"id":262664,"name":"psychedelia"},{"id":324940,"name":"hesse"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Loop Barcelona","release_date":"2023-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
