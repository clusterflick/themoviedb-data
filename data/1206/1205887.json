The business is managed by Anna and her beautiful nephew Max, entangled in dubious circles of clandestine gambling dens and drug trafficking. Sylvia, a writer in crisis (and looking for new inspiration) also stays in the guesthouse accompanied by Joan, a young woman with whom Sylvia maintains an ambiguous relationship. Also staying there are Christine, a hysterical woman with a criminal record and her husband Dominic, a listless and parasitic man. Finally, Dr. Ruby, a young and distinguished doctor who is preparing to hold a conference in Miami and who seems to have known Bianca before the accident that caused her blindness, also arrived a few days ago.","popularity":0.6165,"poster_path":"/hapD2ozapv0ImzaF8OkmSzlvnKA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23118,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leader Cinematografica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":190,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blind Man's Bluff","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corinne Cléry","original_name":"Corinne Cléry","popularity":0.1843,"profile_path":"/xFo2LlhaLkYJQVxhddE7eovrgoS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Anna","credit_id":"6555da50ea84c71094008ece","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Roundtree","original_name":"Richard Roundtree","popularity":0.7254,"profile_path":"/wPuLgW8PrzJFBrfsB03oon5MT7f.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gray","credit_id":"6555da61b5400214d06e284d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":137353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Villoresi","original_name":"Pamela Villoresi","popularity":0.1201,"profile_path":"/hgp5shSYLL3IfhvTYqDOJ0Bh7q.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sylvia","credit_id":"6555da7267b61345ccaf2d56","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Lovelock","original_name":"Ray Lovelock","popularity":0.2665,"profile_path":"/uZQa8foSrVLnTaBc3oQflriMawl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Ruby","credit_id":"6555da8653866e00ff072d85","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovanni Guidelli","original_name":"Giovanni Guidelli","popularity":0.1331,"profile_path":"/spM27nICDvihBKkQ4ax1RKbJURl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Max","credit_id":"6555da970816c700c3dbc856","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":48272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anja Kruse","original_name":"Anja Kruse","popularity":0.7529,"profile_path":"/3oxxuFljbmvdR02OkB4d8H6LRvf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Christine","credit_id":"6555dab1d4fe0400c4224a45","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aitana Sánchez-Gijón","original_name":"Aitana Sánchez-Gijón","popularity":0.7997,"profile_path":"/4gm7EJzvJQbN2RPW1ZOcEzF1jDn.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bianca","credit_id":"6555dac9d4fe0400e1b36c4b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tobias Hoesl","original_name":"Tobias Hoesl","popularity":0.1521,"profile_path":"/cWEGqHiRQKYjrjBPc0YWfNdF854.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dominic","credit_id":"6555dade53866e00e2931c83","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefania Orsola Garello","original_name":"Stefania Orsola Garello","popularity":0.1199,"profile_path":"/jo33KZQiZlZXYjQfFoGf2Sowtxd.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Joan","credit_id":"6555daeeb5400214d1161c1b","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Caiano","original_name":"Mario Caiano","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/tNbuT5Uauof5sBDttmprARvk7TJ.jpg","credit_id":"6555db12ea84c7109300f5b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Caiano","original_name":"Mario Caiano","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/tNbuT5Uauof5sBDttmprARvk7TJ.jpg","credit_id":"6555db21b5400214d06e28ae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0239671","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hapD2ozapv0ImzaF8OkmSzlvnKA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1994-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
