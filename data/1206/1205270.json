The voyage takes place in an old ice-cream truck driven by the girl’s brother, Alek. Contrasting with his adventurous sister, Alek is a melancholic spirit who finds solace in making music.\r During their journey, the siblings discover that their father, Klaus, traded his soul to the Devil to become a successful musician and a father capable of supporting a family (though it didn’t turn out as planned). Returning home won’t be easy, especially when Hell City proves to be alluring and Rainbow befriends the Devil, while Alek confronts his father.\r Despite the apparent pleasantness, there will be a price to pay. The greatest challenge for Rainbow’s family won’t be facing the Devil, but rather confronting the demons of their past and their own vulnerabilities to temptation.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":88672,"logo_path":"/meFXC1APvM2kb6nxpOhHF1I9w9G.png","name":"Animoon","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Rainbow in Hell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812311,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tessa Moult-Milewska","original_name":"Tessa Moult-Milewska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655408aa9653f613f474e53e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812311,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tessa Moult-Milewska","original_name":"Tessa Moult-Milewska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655408b19653f613f74dba4d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3194657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kris Genjin","original_name":"Kris Genjin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65540b7e0816c700fd2f5bf7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Character Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2812311,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tessa Moult-Milewska","original_name":"Tessa Moult-Milewska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65540ba1ac4161011ef7c0df","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rainbow in Hell - official teaser (dir.
