It was the band's first single in five years after 1997's \"Smack My Bitch Up\", and was also their first release after dancer Leeroy Thornhill left the band in 2000.  The single, as well as the accompanying music video, was controversial, and was met with a negative response from critics. The song's lyrics, written by Keith Flint, were criticised in particular for heavily playing upon the misuse of the \"date rape\" drug Rohypnol. Liam Howlett later disowned the single.[1][clarification needed] Despite this criticism, the song was a top-five hit on the Canadian and UK Singles Charts.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/pRrZjRukla6J302rmEcT4BKpiDM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Prodigy - Baby's Got A Temper (2002) DVD","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lnDG7fLhFOH4xE97mWKV5RHbvpb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pRrZjRukla6J302rmEcT4BKpiDM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
