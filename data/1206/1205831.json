The film introduces the stars, including Robert Taylor, but focuses primarily on the challenges of filming on location. The rugged countryside provides a beautiful backdrop but provides few facilities for film making. Transportation, on site facilities for rehearsal, eating and daytime shelter all had to be provided. The shoot lasted approximately 8 weeks.","popularity":0.3386,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Challenge the Wilderness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4379629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Dailey","original_name":"Pete Dailey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self (voice)","credit_id":"6555aa3eaa659e00e290b492","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debbie Reynolds","original_name":"Debbie Reynolds","popularity":1.354,"profile_path":"/9Z9DQqNztKlinANGGgD5dQODtlr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (uncredited)","credit_id":"6555aa6dd4fe0400ac368155","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4379626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Atlas","original_name":"Jack Atlas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6555aa0f53866e011c0797cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0176598","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1951-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
