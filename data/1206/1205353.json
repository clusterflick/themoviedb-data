The eight passengers in the carriage all avert their gaze, each preoccupied with their own concerns. But when the beggar drops behind him a crumpled fifty-dollar note, eyes start to falter. Tension breaks out into a brawl just as the train announces its arrival at the next station. It is at that moment that the beggar makes an ironic re-entrance, but this time the passengersâ€™ gaze are transfixed onto him, no longer ashamed to hide their suspicion about his identity. What will be the consequence of their decisions, driven by blind greed?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gaze","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4377790,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wonjin Kim","original_name":"Wonjin Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655441169653f613f589f6f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
