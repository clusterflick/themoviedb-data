Two young deaf free divers on vacation have been wandering the region for a few days. They don't have much and travel light. They spend the nights mainly on beaches. The hoped-for adventure has so far failed to materialize and connecting with other people is also proving more difficult than expected. They can’t seem to find access. When, during the daily underwater hunt, deep in a kelp forest, the sky over Zinédine suddenly darkens, he emerges, driven by curiosity. There he discovers a drifting sailing ship. The two guide the boat back to shore and shortly thereafter meet Jade, the owner of the boat. She invites them to continue their journey by ship. At last the boys seem to be able to experience what they could not before, but the sudden death of the sailor replaces the newly gained feeling of ease with fear of being accused of murder, and of having been betrayed by fate.","popularity":0.3136,"poster_path":"/rfAMz5EzBthR3HAIxRTuieAA0JQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117,"logo_path":"/twj6GjwWKt23x21fkxItt7v7lEQ.png","name":"Kunsthochschule für Medien Köln","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Métèque","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3058555,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lauritz Baudisch","original_name":"Lauritz Baudisch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655391acac416100e33ca5c0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3521755,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Cedric Ernoult","original_name":"Cedric Ernoult","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655391709653f613f3b77454","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Moustaki","original_name":"Georges Moustaki","popularity":0.3823,"profile_path":"/ne66PUBCEaRlYObX1OqtiIAyV94.jpg","credit_id":"6553917d0816c700c3dab139","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360184,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Torsten Büttner","original_name":"Torsten Büttner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655391b8903c520138fa5d5f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/rfAMz5EzBthR3HAIxRTuieAA0JQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"KFFK Kurzfilmfestival Köln","release_date":"2023-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
