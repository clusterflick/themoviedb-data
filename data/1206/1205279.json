The film weaves together interviews with elders, artists, and other hands-on practitioners who speak to how all parts of the tree were - and still are - important to make use of, while also highlighting the importance of protecting this ancient ancestor throughout the film. We look at how cedar is bridging cultural gaps today, and how this passing down of knowledge to the next generation is essential for promoting strength of culture in so many Indigenous communities.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/okGA2OGgEQJdlv8SyunY5YgU8jA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Cedar Is Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4549491,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gavin Andrews","original_name":"Gavin Andrews","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d5f87de6d3cc0148bfa7a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3423046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie D.
