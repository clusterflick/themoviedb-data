Ildiko is excited to learn that her former teacher from secondary school will pay them a visit. Ildiko gladly becomes nostalgic about the school years spent with Vera as her teacher, but mostly because of Vera's care for the students who needed her support. Coinciding with Vera's visit, Ildiko's daughter returns home with her openly gay friends from a demonstration in Budapest. Vera notices their rainbow flag and cannot keep what she really thinks to herself.","popularity":0.0641,"poster_path":"/2ezaFr3H5JWvgeG5zejetPhiU3N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Need Help","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4377672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Kali","original_name":"Andrea Kali","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65542ca953866e00abaa6be1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1036334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emese Vasvári","original_name":"Emese Vasvári","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/x26A1qdzaZqdZreBDmL12pfG1uv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65542cb067b61345cf04bcee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4377673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juli Papp","original_name":"Juli Papp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65542cbc0816c700c3daf62a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4377675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivér Jenes","original_name":"Olivér Jenes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65542cc3ad50f000eb0a7e6e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4377676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ferenc Papp","original_name":"Ferenc Papp","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65542ccdad50f00108a3145d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2181467,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zsuzsanna Bak","original_name":"Zsuzsanna Bak","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65542c89ad50f001252b8114","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2181467,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zsuzsanna Bak","original_name":"Zsuzsanna Bak","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65542c8fac416100ad27ae70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29540881","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2ezaFr3H5JWvgeG5zejetPhiU3N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
