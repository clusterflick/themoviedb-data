Lapin confidently steps on the cornea of mediocrity, enjoying the situation to the fullest. Loved by his muses, the artist is not ashamed of his dalliances.

The new Estonian film opens the doors to a disappearing Bohemianism, in which racy vocabulary reigns instead of political correctness.","popularity":0.0967,"poster_path":"/3CR2179hSkL95lajyCXGg5isi3t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73069,"logo_path":"/kduAeBBaa7Te5jdNL9NFV2OnbS3.png","name":"Filmivabrik","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2018-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Live the Scandals!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4034376,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Leonhard Lapin","original_name":"Leonhard Lapin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6553ce8a0816c700c3dac3f8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1593797,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marju Lepp","original_name":"Marju Lepp","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/utwDe0XJCDwLjiBJEjkeF0g8hI1.jpg","credit_id":"6553ceb2d4fe0400e1b279c2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Vainokivi","original_name":"Manfred Vainokivi","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/vNwDtCRWcI6fYRlu6jN0nCvx2ev.jpg","credit_id":"6553cec1d4fe0400ac359c7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Vainokivi","original_name":"Manfred Vainokivi","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/vNwDtCRWcI6fYRlu6jN0nCvx2ev.jpg","credit_id":"6553ceca0816c700abbbf2a6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manfred Vainokivi","original_name":"Manfred Vainokivi","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/vNwDtCRWcI6fYRlu6jN0nCvx2ev.jpg","credit_id":"6553ced453866e00ff06000c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8351636","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":"et","file_path":"/3CR2179hSkL95lajyCXGg5isi3t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2679,"name":"artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
