This year, its inhabitants have the unusual honour of taking care of the Spring Flower, thanks to which the season of snow comes to an end and life in the Tatras is reborn. Unfortunately, as a result of a scuffle caused by an argument between the Hare and the Bear, the Spring Blossom disappears. Despite their mutual resentment, guilt and the horror of eternal winter push the heroes to embark on a search. Their shared adventures, adversity and the adversaries they face cause the characters to discover the truth about each other and, despite their many quarrels, they manage to forge a deep friendship.","popularity":0.1638,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":88672,"logo_path":"/meFXC1APvM2kb6nxpOhHF1I9w9G.png","name":"Animoon","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Don't Sleep or They'll Rob You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2832966,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zofia Jaroszuk","original_name":"Zofia Jaroszuk","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65542e7bea84c710959cf518","department":"Writing","job":"Script Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4377682,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kasia Panas","original_name":"Kasia Panas","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65542e89ad50f001429ccfc0","department":"Writing","job":"Script Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791648,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Grzegorz Wacławek","original_name":"Grzegorz Wacławek","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65542e6d9653f613f863e888","department":"Writing","job":"Script Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3440656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malgorzata Rżanek","original_name":"Malgorzata Rżanek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65542e2bea84c71096dc9208","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3440656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malgorzata Rżanek","original_name":"Malgorzata Rżanek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65542e23ac416100e33ce45a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791648,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Grzegorz Wacławek","original_name":"Grzegorz Wacławek","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65542e5bd4fe04011b90dbe2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
