Here, we explore the life and work of Xesús \"Chichi\" Campos, a pioneer in Galician comics, anti-Franco activist, gallery owner, and humorist. In short, one of the most forgotten figures in Galician culture. When he passed away, he left behind a son who was only eleven years old with many questions.
