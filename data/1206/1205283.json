The main characters of the film are Barnabas, a power juggler, Jonas Ramanauskas, a folk artist of the LSSR, and Jadvyga Stankutė-Ramanauskienė, an acrobat. Both are long retired, but even in their cosy homes, their memories of the circus do not leave them, so the film recalls the interesting and sad history of Lithuanian circus.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/7eZFXHciNfLw4QlfZVQ8FGBo6jx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185662,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lietuvos Kinostudija","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barnabas Stipruolis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4377518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Ramanauskas","original_name":"Jonas Ramanauskas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"655412059653f613f474f44b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4377520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jadvyga Stankutė-Ramanauskienė","original_name":"Jadvyga Stankutė-Ramanauskienė","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"655412110816c700abbc0dc5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315247,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henrikas Šablevičius","original_name":"Henrikas Šablevičius","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/4wuCB6GF8vHcHjdr3QUQyFhlwbV.jpg","credit_id":"65541222ea84c71096dc76e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315247,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henrikas Šablevičius","original_name":"Henrikas Šablevičius","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/4wuCB6GF8vHcHjdr3QUQyFhlwbV.jpg","credit_id":"655412399653f613f474f489","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2306535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kornelijus Matuzevičius","original_name":"Kornelijus Matuzevičius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6554124aea84c71094ff95f9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4292162,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kazys Zabulis","original_name":"Kazys Zabulis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6554127b0816c700fd2f67d0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29980351","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7eZFXHciNfLw4QlfZVQ8FGBo6jx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
