During the imminent period of the 1990s World Cup, he meets Andrea Viscomi, a late career footballer, captain of the local football team, U.S.Collidoro. Their lives are intertwined. The friendship with the footballer rekindles in the boy the desire for a father figure that he has never had and in the footballer a forgotten carefree time, which has been lost above all due to his involvement in match-fixing. The coming-of-age novel of Marcello crosses the descending parable of Andrea's career, in the sign of a friendship necessary for both.","popularity":0.0468,"poster_path":"/4QvFkzSWXzwb2C7quaTUHizfeyL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
