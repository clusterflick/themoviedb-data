The islanders' livelihood was affected so they formed the life-saving squad. The guesthouse owner set up “ The Three No's Rental Rules”. The part-time girl at the supermarket observed customers who might buy charcoal for suicide. Some islanders were on the lookout for distressed visitors. Occasionally, they succeeded in stopping the tragedy. Some survivors even joined the squad. At times, they made funny mistakes and met with hiccups in the life-saving endeavors. With trial and error, they explored the essential needs in people's hearts.","popularity":0.0537,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Eternal Sunshine Life-saving Squad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3418580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Sum-Yuet","original_name":"Li Sum-Yuet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6555c027aa659e011c19000c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fruit Chan","original_name":"陳果","popularity":0.4401,"profile_path":"/j1Xktbs6M6kNIwaLUps9swSEdVs.jpg","credit_id":"6555c03453866e00c5b1d3b2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3418580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Sum-Yuet","original_name":"Li Sum-Yuet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6555c01dd4fe0400e1b35ef6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
