With a pact to move to Chicago and dive headfirst into the vibrant theatre scene, the future seems bright for this quirky band of friends. Unfortunately, after a year goes by they find they have yet to connect, having gone separate ways, dealing with various \"day jobs,\" an oddly intrusive neighbor, or theatre productions gone horribly, and hilariously, wrong. It takes the playwright in the group, who has finally developed enough angst to complete his latest work, to persuade them to take a risk, get the band back together, and produce his original play.","popularity":0.1739,"poster_path":"/4Kh4vq068t83UiRXd1ed5Y8bAaN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59629,"logo_path":null,"name":"CNGM Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Five recent college graduates move to Chicago to pursue a career in the performing arts.","title":"Off-Loop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4376973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Economus","original_name":"Jason Economus","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Barry","credit_id":"6553ced8ea84c71096dc5c0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2182627,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan C.
