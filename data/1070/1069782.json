That time was uncertain and dark. Still reeling from losing Dallas, we found out that Mike needed to have emergency wrist surgery. We needed to play these songs, not knowing if we would ever have the opportunity again.  With one day's notice, documentary filmmaker Ron Mann and a stellar crew pulled together to help us capture these songs. Friends and family gathered to help out and show their support. James McKenty engineered in his mobile recording trailer, In Record Time Studio. The resulting film looked and sounded better than we could have hoped.  We are thankful to share that Mike's surgery was successful and we are back out on the road and coming to a city near you.","popularity":0.4155,"poster_path":"/gYLmBUh0riXRY79o6EOQnkf97bi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109947,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sphinx
