An experimental film told from the heart of SUBLIMEBBABY and eyes of Angelo Bote — complex, strong, independent, aggressive, soft, vulnerable.  We embrace both masculine and feminine aspects following the woman on screen.  “To maintain an interest in life, to laugh at the little/big things. To embrace my feminine energy but let my masculine shine in coexistence. These are my promises to my younger self.”","popularity":0.2975,"poster_path":"/AaMn6J1w7kqjo5YX0z4iUqHi5s2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":189743,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sol/Hous","origin_country":""},{"id":189744,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong
