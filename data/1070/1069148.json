The film shows the microscopic ecosystem that constitutes Monet’s “pictorial Garden”. It is an attempt to capture it from a non-perspectival point of view.  Shot as a single sequence running the duration of a 400-foot reel, it features views of the edges of water-lily’s leaves and of Monet’s iconic green bridge, until the lens of the camera is intentionally removed to place the analogue film directly in contact with the environment, recording its presence with no interface. The abstract image resulting from this process captures the shimmering lights and movements of all beings during this quiet summer night.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/9E9LXOMiKW9Zzlbtgr9IYgk8vav.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meadow Report","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1384297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marine Hugonnier","original_name":"Marine Hugonnier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b415e5c56d2d0089b3196a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1544,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9E9LXOMiKW9Zzlbtgr9IYgk8vav.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1030}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
