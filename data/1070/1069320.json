It chronicles a journey to Sierra Leone in 2013 to visit the home villages of the rebels who captured the slave schooner Amistad, to interview elders about local memory of the incident, and to search for the long-lost ruins of Lomboko, the slave trading factory where their cruel transatlantic voyage began. The filmmakers rely on the knowledge of villagers, fishermen, and truck drivers to recover a lost history from below in the struggle against slavery, and to explore the African origins of the heroes of the Amistad incident.","popularity":0.0519,"poster_path":"/AuV7VNOWRxujPMD2gnE5GJWKFPD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Braddock Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SL","name":"Sierra Leone"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghosts of Amistad - In the Footsteps of Rebels","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Buba","original_name":"Tony Buba","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/rZ1XX9nlje6A84wMtJcNLzegK1Q.jpg","credit_id":"63b482ce1d1bf400a02f9f2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1038569,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tom Dubenski","original_name":"Tom Dubenski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b4859fcb802800823e91bc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7315966","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.761,"height":2550,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AuV7VNOWRxujPMD2gnE5GJWKFPD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1941}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
