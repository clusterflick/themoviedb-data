The manipulative Khovansky is powerfully portrayed here by Alexander Vedernikov, another of the world’s greatest basses, little known outside of the Soviet Union. Marfa, one of Dosifei’s followers and a fortune teller, is sung by the legendary mezzo-soprano Irina Arkhipova in a performance of great authority and dignity. Russian opera at the Bolshoi is the genuine article and the remainder of the cast is equally impressive, from the mistrusting Prince Galitsyn of Evgeny Raikov to the clever, informing Shaklovity of Vladislav Romanovsky. The Bolshoi chorus and orchestra is conducted by Yuri Simonov.","popularity":0.061,"poster_path":"/d1F8Apmn0KbUvAZ8hgY2dMg8OxB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":172,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is the also the ONLY full-length performance of Mussorgsky's opera.","title":"Khovanshchina","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1655679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evgeny Nesterenko","original_name":"Евгений Нестеренко","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/xH6gaMXTJB2B3SHzV74fpFE0Mj2.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dosifei","credit_id":"6775591e1c1d7e09cf615a62","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1655761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Arkhipova","original_name":"Ирина Архипова","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/nSpMOK6IvuKNxQXyNOmjqr8cLGB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marfa","credit_id":"63b582c51d1bf400a0300956","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3857926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evgeny Raikov","original_name":"Evgeny Raikov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Prince Galitsyn","credit_id":"63b582e6c56d2d00a9846721","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3857927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladislav Romanovsky","original_name":"Vladislav Romanovsky","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Shaklovity","credit_id":"63b58302875d1a007d7058ec","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3857928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandr Vedernikov","original_name":"Aleksandr Vedernikov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Khovansky","credit_id":"63b583239715ae00913d134f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1994688,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yuri Simonov","original_name":"Yuri Simonov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"63b5835a9715ae007a729a2e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70650,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Modeste Moussorgsky","original_name":"Modeste Moussorgsky","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":"/80ysKl0MqarVD8G3gEEujncqIii.jpg","credit_id":"677559487d1bc87de761d189","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70650,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Modeste Moussorgsky","original_name":"Modeste Moussorgsky","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":"/80ysKl0MqarVD8G3gEEujncqIii.jpg","credit_id":"677559564111599e3812e0db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3978552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elena Macheret","original_name":"Елена Мачерет","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6775596f4111599e3812e0e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0791081","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":782,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d1F8Apmn0KbUvAZ8hgY2dMg8OxB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":521}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
