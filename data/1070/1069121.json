This is how the Swedish diplomat is introduced in ‘Blix Not Bombs’. And if there is one fire he is particularly associated with, it is the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Prior to the invasion, Blix led the delegation of UN officials to find out whether weapons of mass destruction were present in Iraq. And it is the invasion and its consequences that we get Blix’s formidably insightful analysis of in a thorough and honest conversation with director Greta Stocklassa. Few others understand the complexities of international politics on the world stage like Blix, and none can explain it with his intellectual elegance. But Stocklassa’s film is also a portrait of the man himself, now an elderly gentleman, writing his memoirs, walking with a cane and watching birds through the window of his apartment. His outlook and commitment is as urgent as ever, as Blix takes stock of the invasion of Iraq and the state of the world today.","popularity":0.3004,"poster_path":"/tjpTyEFBrwC4WTs70mtP9ux0EE6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24701,"logo_path":"/jA4X5Pggj8L4FijoqzXmFOFA4gs.png","name":"Pink Productions","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":122296,"logo_path":"/nntidvBXBQCBB43QgLZ3Q8wHzbj.png","name":"Sisyfos Film","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":101509,"logo_path":"/al4qRaI9Vet4CXbeqI0DE0KnIdl.png","name":"CORSO Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2023-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A deep and thorough interview-portrait of Swedish top diplomat Hans Blix, who held world history in his hands in Iraq 20 years ago.
