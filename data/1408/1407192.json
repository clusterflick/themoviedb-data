The advertisement was drawn by the much beloved Danish multi-talent Robert Storm Petersen, popularly known as Storm P., whose many accomplishments included being behind some of Denmark’s earliest animated films. This ad also includes a few seconds of live-action footage showing Storm P. himself smoking a pipe and reading an issue of ‘Hjemmet’.
