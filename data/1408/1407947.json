Stirred by the bombing of Baghdad and Tel Aviv in the Gulf War of 1991, director Duki Dror - the son of the youngest of the three brothers - retraces his Iraqi roots. Faced with the reclusive silence of his father, Dror digs up bits of information about the family's past. Finally, his reluctant father divulges a long kept secret. A revelatory family portrait that balances humor with pain.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Fantasia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0479723","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"CHANUKAH MOVIE \"My Fantasia\"","key":"geNjkNrN_Vk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-07-02T11:34:09.000Z","id":"676d93572c9097b266614549"}]}}}
