The movie's not clear on what their racket is, other than the fact that it's lucrative. We first meet them trying to collect money from some other guy. It turns into a gunfight. This scene is ultimately inconsequential. Most scenes are.  Jump to five years later. Our heroes have gone straight and work as landscapers. The money's short, so that doesn't last long. They connect with a shot-caller and get back in the dope game. A bunch of gangster shit happens. It's too tedious to summarize. The movie ends with a \"TO BE CONTINUED\" card. I didn't bother to click the notification bell.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5rCk9uLIZ356mO1PRiC1JGowKrj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chekmate","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13161258","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5rCk9uLIZ356mO1PRiC1JGowKrj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
