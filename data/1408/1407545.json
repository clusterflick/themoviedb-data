Positioned above and to the side of her desk, the camera's wide-angle lens distorts the scene, rendering straight lines as curves, and producing a sense of deep spacial recession in a confined room.  Forty-minutes long, Bacher's video distills individual frames from documentary footage, reanimating them as a succession of stills.  Time-code numbers at the top of the frame record the date and time of each image.
