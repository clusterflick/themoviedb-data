At its peak, the mines employed 36,000 workers who braved the dangerous labour and built a new life in the mining camp. Today, many third and fourth generation gold miners face the threat of not just unemployment but displacement from the area they have made their own. This film is a tribute to the \"labouring lions\" of Kolar Gold Field, a historical reconstruction of their work, culture and rich political traditions.","popularity":0.2269,"poster_path":"/6cwS6dfHhle9thlrvNgWZAYHWJd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":248307,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lipman-Miliband Trust","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After the Gold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5139187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janaki Nair","original_name":"Janaki Nair","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"676ae0778c9f82c5607ec9c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5139205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Narayan Nair","original_name":"Narayan Nair","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Retired Mining Employee","credit_id":"676ae208a05c09ebea7ebccc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5139207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kasinathan","original_name":"Kasinathan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Retired Mining Employee","credit_id":"676ae221b434251268a9f582","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5139210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
