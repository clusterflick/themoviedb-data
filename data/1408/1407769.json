It is totally different from the psychedelic toads found in North America. The Sapo's venom produces an effect much closer to morphine than LSD, but really it's not like either of those things. It's a distinctly vomitous dissociative experience unlike anything else I've ever encountered.  I had to find out what this frog really does, but supposedly it cannot produce its venom in captivity. The only way to experience its unique trip is to travel down the Amazon River and catch one yourself, which is exactly what I did.\" - Hamilton Morris, Vice correspondent","popularity":0.0561,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":200381,"logo_path":"/1OAjprr0LoAWXC5WS6favtDTohg.png","name":"VICE","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tripping on Hallucinogenic Frogs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1494631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hamilton Morris","original_name":"Hamilton Morris","popularity":0.0983,"profile_path":"/a8dDO1Jg6UtBz7fwDAKVIg6N2QC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"676d1e95f9bc02e498927833","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1533551,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santiago Stelley","original_name":"Santiago Stelley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676d1e3cf9bc02e49892781d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1533551,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santiago Stelley","original_name":"Santiago Stelley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676d1e59d6d10ecc8c128bbb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937984,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thiago Da Costa","original_name":"Thiago Da Costa","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/jlyGWPxJimcNRZy42gSZoZrF7z8.jpg","credit_id":"676d1e692c9097b266613614","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937984,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thiago Da Costa","original_name":"Thiago Da Costa","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/jlyGWPxJimcNRZy42gSZoZrF7z8.jpg","credit_id":"676d1e7c2c9097b266613620","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hFMYsKnd07GpVJSAxLPog7Rp9h6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
