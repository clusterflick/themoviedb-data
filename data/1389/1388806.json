Lucille's mother prevails, and Lucille leaves Paul a note in their secret hiding place saying that she is going to marry Allen. Paul is injured when thrown from a horse and does not receive the note. He is nursed back to health in the home of entomologist Thomas Wiggan, whose son Johnnie is in love with Marion Vale, Lucille's younger sister. Two years later, Lucille and Allen return to the estate, very much in love, and engage Paul's services. The note is found, still waiting in the secret hiding place. After many complications, and with the help of her friend Suzanne Russell, Lucille recovers the possibly incriminating note.","popularity":0.1672,"poster_path":"/jnhDYpqQr5va4X0d44aNrLdJn5W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38293,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Green Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Scrap of Paper","type":"working title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Price of Doubt","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlyle Blackwell","original_name":"Carlyle Blackwell","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/rVXhwWrYMW1bwxobOAP0ZXG1Zby.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Paul Arden","credit_id":"67387b4d35f1e6d17d2e9f5e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1544765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Greeley","original_name":"Evelyn Greeley","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/2kGszcsvdMrG8fdzgIwWzFqvx2D.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Suzanne Russell","credit_id":"67387b56443543191ccbbc51","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Montagu Love","original_name":"Montagu Love","popularity":0.1957,"profile_path":"/aCOahFpYdCKMOg8RO9jMsFOA5xx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Allen Granat","credit_id":"67387b60624a85b8899e9c74","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Elvidge","original_name":"June Elvidge","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/fbcSD4gt790qR0CBpsqqL4EkqfP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lucille Vale","credit_id":"67387b6a624a85b8899e9c81","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Hines","original_name":"Johnny Hines","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":"/zvTdXSM69BPFWhuvH8aMqG7KTti.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Johnnie Wiggan","credit_id":"67387b75624a85b8899e9c85","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathilde Brundage","original_name":"Mathilde Brundage","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/8abMY5gVWjuJosGpdsMrdgWW3kS.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ms. Vale","credit_id":"67387b9e58bef8bc3d0e2ace","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madge Evans","original_name":"Madge Evans","popularity":0.2079,"profile_path":"/pl8Za5y7tmMoCgTRkpCcSFISvxd.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Child","credit_id":"67387bd896be3a06fad91921","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1982067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Drumier","original_name":"Jack Drumier","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/zlP3ZtlDIEp3ZdTgJlUYCpk1zLy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Thomas Wiggan","credit_id":"67387b7f35f1e6d17d2e9f65","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5062760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Dee","original_name":"Dorothy Dee","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Marion Vale","credit_id":"67387b9496be3a06fad91900","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Black","original_name":"William Black","popularity":0.114,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Capt.
