But success got to their heads, lost their way and broke up without even a “goodbye” to the fans.  In this film, you’ll experience the joy of seeing them back together, and  celebrate the new lineup re-assembled in 2017, followed by the recording of “Solid Gold”. The energy, kindness and spirit of Squad Five-O’s early days is still present, and you’ll get to experience it all.","popularity":0.0743,"poster_path":"/iTMTG8vppANY1ihYqo0YNC8dba6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246646,"logo_path":null,"name":"JOHN CALEB JACKSON LLC","origin_country":""},{"id":246647,"logo_path":null,"name":"DADDIO RECORDS","origin_country":""},{"id":246648,"logo_path":null,"name":"UNORIGINAL VINYL","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"All the Energy.
