One afternoon he receives a letter from his sister telling him that she has sold the family land in the mountains. César decides to abandon his job and undertakes a trip to that area, with the aim of recovering the urn with Elena's ashes buried there. Walking he faces the mourning veiled for years.  The territory of his childhood is no longer the same, the forest fires, the advance of private property have changed everything. But the encounters along the way open him to a world that he had refused to face after living trapped in his job.","popularity":0.4419,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":139361,"logo_path":null,"name":"Punto de Fuga Cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2024-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Then, the Fog","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"After, the Fog","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pablo Limarzi","original_name":"Pablo Limarzi","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/bP4FuvNuEWuBdlzPb2lYAVripH8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67461e04045c335d1f4e4ee1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5084187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolina Baitella","original_name":"Carolina Baitella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67461e1c84977c50dda0ff86","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5084188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Ruiz","original_name":"Ana Ruiz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67461e329c5df08c3f124d2d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5084190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Lima","original_name":"Carlos Lima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67461e4ca9106e84f16facc6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5084191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecilia Curtino","original_name":"Cecilia Curtino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67461e668130e830b8609289","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":914866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mara Santucho","original_name":"Mara Santucho","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/eHFuFe8zIVWww51DaRC9ONaJxeE.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67461e78a9106e84f16facd0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5084193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodrigo Fierro","original_name":"Rodrigo Fierro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"67461e8a9c5df08c3f124d55","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5084194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Heredia","original_name":"Sergio Heredia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"67461ebd9c15749790529b74","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1544160,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martín Sappia","original_name":"Martín Sappia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6738c583d28043e976e38276","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2456531,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eva Cáceres","original_name":"Eva Cáceres","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673e231a87917078d0109bb6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2540472,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ana Lucía Frau","original_name":"Ana Lucía Frau","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673e233287917078d0109bc9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1544160,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martín Sappia","original_name":"Martín Sappia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673e2348f48b04b8d9057583","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35480439","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9cieVPcYW94l2MY2rjwRhFjBbEb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Contracampo","release_date":"2024-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"ALL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jeonju International Film Festival","release_date":"2025-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
