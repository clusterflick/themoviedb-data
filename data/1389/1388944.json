Fast-forward several years and they again find themselves on opposite sides, this time about compensation for the properties of Tories--colonists who sided with the British--during the war. Hamilton falls for Maria Reynolds, who it turns out is secretly the wife of prominent pawnbroker Jacob Clingman, a friend of Burr's. The pair conspire to destroy Hamilton, who is now Secretary of the Treasury and married to the daughter of a prominent army general, by making public several love letters Hamilton had written to Mrs. Reynolds.","popularity":0.2864,"poster_path":"/oYWA2lolQqk1NqiLVgMfmqjb5Tv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38293,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beautiful Mrs. Reynolds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Adventurer","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Elvidge","original_name":"June Elvidge","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/fbcSD4gt790qR0CBpsqqL4EkqfP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mrs. Maria Reynolds","credit_id":"6738da9e443543191ccbcde1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlyle Blackwell","original_name":"Carlyle Blackwell","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":"/rVXhwWrYMW1bwxobOAP0ZXG1Zby.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alexander Hamilton","credit_id":"6738daa8624a85b8899eafd5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Ashley","original_name":"Arthur Ashley","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/bvdYXp0uMcvYL2LrXclVXSuhhyC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Aaron Burr","credit_id":"6738dab1624a85b8899eafe7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1452886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Gerard","original_name":"Carl Gerard","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/iOqHD6HTbnzjqzrBg5gTbWazSyy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"James Reynolds","credit_id":"6738dabcbbb49f06a00d75be","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1544765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Greeley","original_name":"Evelyn Greeley","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/2kGszcsvdMrG8fdzgIwWzFqvx2D.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Margaret Moncrieffe","credit_id":"6738dacf624a85b8899eafec","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Belmore","original_name":"Lionel Belmore","popularity":0.1875,"profile_path":"/1CVW0bmfp5flHBsLPnPhkJo8fZJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gen.
