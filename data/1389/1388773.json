Elsa von Brabant is accused of fratricide, but no one dares to prove her innocence in this inexplicable case. Trapped in a reality that no one shares with her, a man enters her life, promising to fight for her—on one condition: Elsa must trust him blindly and never ask his name or origin. An intrigue causes Elsa to break her promise. The truth brings her brother back and reveals his divine origin, but she pays a heavy price.","popularity":0.1425,"poster_path":"/3V5tPVj2JiZEk11r9MXqAuu7wDg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Staatsoper Unter den Linden","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":207,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Staatsoper unter den Linden","title":"Lohengrin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":266306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Alagna","original_name":"Roberto Alagna","popularity":0.2857,"profile_path":"/1EuLaoZAfrDBK01CYJGdjQ34VzO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lohengrin","credit_id":"67384992d28043e976e3743d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vida Miknevičiūtė","original_name":"Vida Miknevičiūtė","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Elsa von Brabant","credit_id":"673849b773a45e5184bf5504","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Pape","original_name":"René Pape","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":"/1VsWqoYANXZNivalpSZfNNqny2H.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Heinrich der Vogler","credit_id":"673849d2d28043e976e37461","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2590315,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ekaterina Gubanova","original_name":"Ekaterina Gubanova","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ortrud","credit_id":"673849ea58bef8bc3d0e25a2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1681257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Gantner","original_name":"Martin Gantner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Friedrich von Telramund","credit_id":"673849fd281ac972ea449a43","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5017554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Kutny","original_name":"Adam Kutny","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":"/m1z5undDCHk0DE33ATtkVDNc5PM.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Heerrufer des Königs","credit_id":"67384a1aff0e18373ceeb8cf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5062581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Horres","original_name":"Karl Horres","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Gottfried","credit_id":"67384a2aff0e18373ceeb8df","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3783155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthias Pintscher","original_name":"Matthias Pintscher","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/wKRgp6qvAgvbXcz3WNcvkIjUDl5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"67384a4b58bef8bc3d0e25d2","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Calixto Bieito","original_name":"Calixto Bieito","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":"/ejZN87NaXPz1pGQNf9eGYE2Ya0J.jpg","credit_id":"67384a6173a45e5184bf5527","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71473,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Wagner","original_name":"Richard Wagner","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":"/fHPBxuWgTjRT8dnGBNi8s3lipDI.jpg","credit_id":"67384a6fd28043e976e3746e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":2346,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3V5tPVj2JiZEk11r9MXqAuu7wDg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1567}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
