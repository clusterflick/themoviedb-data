Oio is a truly unique experience where liquid paint and the cinematographic medium come together to create a painting in motion: a cinepainting! Jets of paint catapulted into the air become perceptible to the human eye through high-speed camera and computer. A bold technical device that allowed Simon Goulet to create a remarkable piece of art, highly acclaimed throughout the world for its \"extraordinary technical inventiveness that takes the image and music on an emotional, dizzying trip toward great creativity\" (International Federation of Film Critics, Annecy, 2003). Oio needed eleven years to be completed.","popularity":0.1018,"poster_path":"/qpnb32xEj2VmINWximDOdpvlisX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":244948,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amoniak Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oïo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"The Cinepainting of Simon Goulet","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2359943,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Goulet","original_name":"Simon Goulet","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/cq9vGNBli5dBgRpzc9RQW1KyJJD.jpg","credit_id":"6738b796624a85b8899ea63d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73613,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Denis-Noël Mostert","original_name":"Denis-Noël Mostert","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6738ba2c624a85b8899ea6e8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500425,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"René Dupéré","original_name":"René Dupéré","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6738ba8f35f1e6d17d2ea800","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500426,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Martin Lord","original_name":"Martin Lord","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6738bab235f1e6d17d2ea80b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1098987,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Susan Gourley","original_name":"Susan Gourley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6738bacb35f1e6d17d2ea829","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0805578","wikidata_id":"Q64995753","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":0.926,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2uyOSdp7DHOhfNTvSBBRnOuOzvx.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":741}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qpnb32xEj2VmINWximDOdpvlisX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":537}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Annecy Animation Festival","release_date":"2003-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
