She arranges a trip abroad for Helen, but Helen arranges to meet Richard and have him drive her to the station. Richardâ€™s aunt gives him his mother's wedding ring as a talisman and en route to the train a traffic backup occurs resulting in Helen missing the train and Richard winning her hand. Auntie claims that the ring is responsible; father only smiles knowing he paid one of his men to bribe streetcar motormen, truckmen, and taxicab drivers to bring about the traffic tie-up.","popularity":0.182,"poster_path":"/mihf0VgmnX7khManaqz0SiMM1RM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mammon and the Archer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Earle","original_name":"Edward Earle","popularity":0.3087,"profile_path":"/mybd58aGD8RYdfjObAcbdgx4og2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Richard Rockwell","credit_id":"67376c0de05823bd9c7c78da","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnes Ayres","original_name":"Agnes Ayres","popularity":0.1182,"profile_path":"/mQObJxwBA3epElaMwpDsXCvaQeH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Helen Lantry","credit_id":"67376c16ba29a051b3cc96f7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3349464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Estar Banks","original_name":"Estar Banks","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/6dzgTlZrhggrdcebP3BxMdHb2up.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Aunt Ellen","credit_id":"67376c2be05823bd9c7c78f0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2357406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Fortier","original_name":"Herbert Fortier","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mr. Rockwell","credit_id":"67376c1f2e2bbc4f8e4a42bf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1994323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Jennings","original_name":"Jane Jennings","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Helen's Mother","credit_id":"67376c31d63fed5826cf5739","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1459274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenneth S.
