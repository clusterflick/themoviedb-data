He is stopped at the door of his workplace by an employee who assumes he's a contractor there to fix a sink. When he makes it to his desk, he is teased and pranked by two of his co-workers, Shawn and Nick then rushed back to work by an impatient supervisor speaking to him through his headset. Lance makes a collections call to Cooper, a student loan debtor who explains to him that he fell past due because his dad pays his bill and there was a problem with his bank account. Cooper rambles about his life to Lance but refuses to pay and hangs up after taking offense to a harmless remark Lance made. A paper football flying from the direction of Shawn and Nick hits Lance in his face. Lance has had enough and walks over to take a swing at one of them and is held back by another co-worker, Devin.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loan Wolves","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5059865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Langston Williams","original_name":"Langston Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"673669d0d63fed5826cf3950","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5059866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillip Barr","original_name":"Phillip Barr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"673669dee05823bd9c7c5c7d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5059867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ramsawh","original_name":"David Ramsawh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"673669e1ff85881393a0b98b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5059868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"JaCorie Johnson","original_name":"JaCorie Johnson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"673669ecd4ffba1e8b2b06f1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5059870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vid Buggs","original_name":"Vid Buggs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"673669f5e05823bd9c7c5c96","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5059871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Lang","original_name":"Ron Lang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"673669fd2954d26476259c0d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5059872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samantha Glick","original_name":"Samantha Glick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67366a002954d26476259c19","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5059873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elijah Lamppin","original_name":"Elijah Lamppin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67366a092954d26476259c28","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5059875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamar Gorham","original_name":"Tamar Gorham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67366a0c2954d26476259c33","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5059867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ramsawh","original_name":"David Ramsawh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67366a18e05823bd9c7c5ca5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5059867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ramsawh","original_name":"David Ramsawh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67366a1ed63fed5826cf3971","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5059867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ramsawh","original_name":"David Ramsawh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67366a23d63fed5826cf3984","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
