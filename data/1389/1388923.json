Viral audios increase paranoia among neighbors, something is happening but we don't know exactly what. In the distance, a neighbor hears that the police do not allow people to work, on television there are parts that surpass any type of imagination. You listen to it without doing anything, it's just that no one knows what to do, something in that entire domestic universe is slightly blurred. Bodies reduced to their minimum movements, time a thicket uneasily calm, but here in Formosa wasn't it always like this? What if something was created in that time so close that we no longer want to think? A neighbor tells another that her brother and other boys were taken away by the police, then she lights a cigarette and looks at the street: she doesn't know what to do.","popularity":0.0562,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A la vuelta de la torre 37","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2147789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Molina","original_name":"Luis Molina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/t5Or4DFhvXaci7y060W4akObuId.jpg","credit_id":"6738ce2abbb49f06a00d734a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5063276,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Juan Pablo Baldessari Ibarra","original_name":"Juan Pablo Baldessari Ibarra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6738cec8443543191ccbcbca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3886460,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ariel Aguiar Capara","original_name":"Ariel Aguiar Capara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6738ced2443543191ccbcbcf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5063276,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Juan Pablo Baldessari Ibarra","original_name":"Juan Pablo Baldessari Ibarra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6738ceea443543191ccbcbd8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
