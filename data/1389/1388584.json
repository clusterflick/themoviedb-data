The live-action cast of Ryuta Sato, Yoshinori Okada and Takashi Tsukamoto take on the challenge of voice acting, showing a different looseness to the live-action version.  Futoshi, Matsun and Mickey are three people with zero ambition. With nothing in particular to do, they just keep on dabbling in a family restaurant late at night. Their evening goes by as they engage and disengage, get excited and lose their temper, and somehow carry on a series of conversations.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The SanMei-sama: Anime edition","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
