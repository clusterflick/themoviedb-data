Strap in and follow the motor racing legends through the streets and breakneck turns of the principality. The history of Grand Prix racing unfolds before us in a noisy cavalcade of spitting roaring, temperamental and powerful machines driven by a motley collection of competitive yet amiable characters. These are the cars and names that make up the sporting Pedigree of Grand Prix racing. While the technical precision of the modern Formula One car is an amazing thing, it is a testament to the love of racing to see drivers throwing these mostly privately owned, sometimes multi-million-dollar one-of-a-kind museum pieces around the tight, narrow streets on the razor edge of control.","popularity":0.4863,"poster_path":"/2FcNrTtVs6WwtnQ1S3gqq5odmB5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":244811,"logo_path":null,"name":"Valorous Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A trip to Monte Carlo for the Grand Prix de Monaco Historique.","title":"Legends of Monte Carlo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5059744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Fitzgerald","original_name":"Ted Fitzgerald","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/e6ShUhRUeYZClFVwZE3vwSTeRiO.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"673662ccd4ffba1e8b2b05f7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5059744,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Fitzgerald","original_name":"Ted Fitzgerald","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/e6ShUhRUeYZClFVwZE3vwSTeRiO.jpg","credit_id":"67365bf72954d2647625984f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2008850,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Earl M.
