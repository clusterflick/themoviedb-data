Muggers, drug dealers and murderers have turned up here to live with families, graduates and pensioners. The only requirement is that you must start a new life and accept Jesus as your saviour. The house is owned by the Jesus Army and run by an ex-acid-dropping hippy. 'They're Christians but don't believe in religion. They live like Jesus would live; that's how they see it', says award winning director Leo Regan. This is a film about a highly intense and often-unpredictable community who set themselves apart from the world but also reveal to us some truths about the society we all live in.","popularity":0.0626,"poster_path":"/nbuXJjaRs6JrCGBasOvXzifzUTJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jesus Army Battlecentre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Regan","original_name":"Leo Regan","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67364b25d4ffba1e8b2b0285","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84375,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roy Ackerman","original_name":"Roy Ackerman","popularity":0.1605,"profile_path":"/gXVtEpOqDJI5cLB1ME8wMYzT3JV.jpg","credit_id":"67364b6cd63fed5826cf33fb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Regan","original_name":"Leo Regan","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67364b8bd63fed5826cf341a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Regan","original_name":"Leo Regan","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67364b97d63fed5826cf343a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nbuXJjaRs6JrCGBasOvXzifzUTJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2001-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
