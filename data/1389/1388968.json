Angered by her refusal to let him explain, Jeffrey leaves his wife and son David, Jeffrey meets Nan on a westbound train. Though he does not love her he offers his protection and the next year they welcome a son, William. Nan pleads with him to divorce Madge and marry her for the sake of their son, but he will refuse. Distraught, she marries Ben Richardson, a client of Jeffrey's client, leaving their son behind. Twenty years pass with David becoming a responsible adult while half-brother William now known as “Rodeo” becomes the leader of a lawless band of robbers. Meanwhile Ben Richardson and Nan have become owners of Chanceland, a gambling-house in Colorado and it is there that things reach a climax between the near identical brothers.","popularity":0.2217,"poster_path":"/rMd1p99z5iCxoWsJtO3YWLLepBH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38293,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Film","origin_country":"US"},{"id":91417,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peerless Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Price of Pride","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlyle Blackwell","original_name":"Carlyle Blackwell","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":"/rVXhwWrYMW1bwxobOAP0ZXG1Zby.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"David","credit_id":"6738efd773a45e5184bf6c7e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Elvidge","original_name":"June Elvidge","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/fbcSD4gt790qR0CBpsqqL4EkqfP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nan Westland","credit_id":"6738efe173a45e5184bf6c8d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1794299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Mills","original_name":"Frank Mills","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":"/bKejLKY0nrVHRmc0gtMXVidy4Oh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jeffrey Arnold Black","credit_id":"6738efec097d404fd667068c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1544765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Greeley","original_name":"Evelyn Greeley","popularity":0.1292,"profile_path":"/2kGszcsvdMrG8fdzgIwWzFqvx2D.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kathleen May","credit_id":"6738eff7097d404fd66706a4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":952657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George MacQuarrie","original_name":"George MacQuarrie","popularity":0.1235,"profile_path":"/9eGUVUBTQLA6e3uT0YmZQ72hPbT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ben Richardson","credit_id":"6738f001097d404fd66706bb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3537774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles W.
