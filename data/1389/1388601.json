Existence at bay either in a physical space or a mental prison. Like a fish out of water or whale in a tank. What it means to fear support, accepting it with the risk of vulnerability and the ability to be empathic towards others even if they lack the tools to help escape out of your own prison. „Adrift“ distills those feelings while simultaneously dealing with the immensely frustrating reality of large sentient animals held in captivity for our own amusement. Dive in but don’t forget to come back up to inhale the air.","popularity":0.0293,"poster_path":"/AuaYEXsmZtV5SAkxooEC6VcigCJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adrift","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucy-Sophie Witthoff","original_name":"Lucy-Sophie Witthoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6737c59735f1e6d17d2e87ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucy-Sophie Witthoff","original_name":"Lucy-Sophie Witthoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6737c5c058bef8bc3d0e181a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucy-Sophie Witthoff","original_name":"Lucy-Sophie Witthoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6737c5d6281ac972ea448592","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucy-Sophie Witthoff","original_name":"Lucy-Sophie Witthoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6737c5f0281ac972ea4485a0","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Modeling"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5061944,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Kristen","original_name":"Richard Kristen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6737c61435f1e6d17d2e87ce","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cmtuC6ATjumyu1rWt4LNMYuucxx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AuaYEXsmZtV5SAkxooEC6VcigCJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"International Film Festival Mannheim Heidelberg","release_date":"2024-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Adrift | Animated Short Film 2023 Trailer","key":"v-dIF4PbO8I","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-09-12T19:13:55.000Z","id":"6737c721624a85b8899e8b05"}]}}}
