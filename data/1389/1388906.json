In the passage from day to night, gestures and melodies unfold that collapse the imposed ways of living and transform into joyful resistance to the advance of the extreme right. We are broken and so are our images. We are a handful of pixels that dance in the darkness, to the rhythm of the power of the banal.","popularity":0.1489,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2024-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las formas de la invención","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3274568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maia Navas","original_name":"Maia Navas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/cEU222KMz8ZaXPIeL4Q0j2ZKJo5.jpg","credit_id":"6738c621d28043e976e38309","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Contracampo","release_date":"2024-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
