Every morning the bunco artists would watch for him on the street corners, and after they had told their hard-luck stories, he would dish out coin to them. When he arrived his office he was almost swamped with panhandlers and bums. Finally he tried his hand at fixing up a lovers' quarrel and put his foot in it. Billy Speedwell, the man in the case, got hold of the old boy and just knocked the spots off him for butting into his affairs. From that time on, Mr. Crabb changed his mind about doing good, and the next morning he cleared all the hobos out of his office. Moral: Cast your bread upon the waters and it will come back to you as sponge cake.","popularity":0.1767,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fable of One Samaritan Who Got Paralysis of the Helping Hand","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Commerford","original_name":"Thomas Commerford","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/lN6BvwoHc2exi8jwNL30sT4Qq7d.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jonah Crabb - The Good Samaritan","credit_id":"6738f659bbb49f06a00d7848","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1322273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florida Kingsley","original_name":"Florida Kingsley","popularity":0.332,"profile_path":"/p7aL4G2HwxPXXdd33WpfS06yGZK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6738f65fad278a8963f84f3d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1269128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Dunkinson","original_name":"Harry Dunkinson","popularity":0.1724,"profile_path":"/uFeYdxINTxnjuEEcrKwhA4ZZ92.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Billy Speedwell","credit_id":"6738f66abbb49f06a00d785f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1319161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Dunbar","original_name":"Helen Dunbar","popularity":0.1343,"profile_path":"/nErEJVdKwRlDuOH6rcBx5isXKWL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6738f6705859f981eedf91fa","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3409857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Royal Douglas","original_name":"Royal Douglas","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"George","credit_id":"6738f67b097d404fd66708a8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1544765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Greeley","original_name":"Evelyn Greeley","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/2kGszcsvdMrG8fdzgIwWzFqvx2D.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6738f681ad278a8963f84f4f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363921,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Ade","original_name":"George Ade","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6738f68f097d404fd66708af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003905","wikidata_id":"Q3986886","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
