She reworks this question over and over again in her mind. It reminds her of why she fled Iran, her homeland. To overcome her trauma, Maryam talks to other journalists around the world, witnesses or victims of the same “sentinels” – these lethal incidents triggered by mines or improvised explosive devices. Despite the defeat of Isis these incidents have increased tenfold, the last scars of a caliphate with multiple fractures. Through various testimonies, Maryam offers a reflection on a profession-passion, the wounds it can leave and above all, how to heal them.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3XEOcnc81IwYtmVlwhOHmNWGeKg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ETERNAL SENTINEL","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2452781,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maryam Ashrafi","original_name":"Maryam Ashrafi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67366398e05823bd9c7c5b87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":973,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3XEOcnc81IwYtmVlwhOHmNWGeKg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":730}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
