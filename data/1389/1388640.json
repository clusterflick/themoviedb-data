Robert Ettinger, 'the father of cryonics,' speaks of his life’s work while his 'patients' experience an unnatural existence in suspended animation.  The film is at once a piece of living (or un-living) history, and a surrealist comedy of waiting for the unknown.  It explores some of humanity’s fascinating responses to fear, loss and grief while offering a potential for hope. In this way, the tale of an intelligent, eccentric and lonely old man becomes a story relatable to everyone.","popularity":0.1479,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":62192,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alchemy Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You, Forever","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1585650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Precious Chong","original_name":"Precious Chong","popularity":0.8755,"profile_path":"/6eH5IgwiRkL6nNoz5fVDOCBgT70.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Elaine Ettinger","credit_id":"6737d90eff0e18373ceeb3df","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4605643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Ettinger","original_name":"Robert Ettinger","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6737d921a181a717eac88859","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Grover","original_name":"Deborah Grover","popularity":0.5924,"profile_path":"/pujVIRIuWJ8VHeamg63uTGpGHWo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rhea Ettinger","credit_id":"6737d937443543191ccbb066","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4605644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tabby Johnson","original_name":"Tabby Johnson","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mae Ettinger","credit_id":"6737d97a281ac972ea448885","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4605645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Zawacki","original_name":"Andy Zawacki","popularity":0.1508,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6737d98d5859f981eedf7128","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2982929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brenda Kovrig","original_name":"Brenda Kovrig","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6737d99a443543191ccbb07f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2982929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brenda Kovrig","original_name":"Brenda Kovrig","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6737d9a0443543191ccbb087","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2982929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brenda Kovrig","original_name":"Brenda Kovrig","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6737d9a9624a85b8899e8e29","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63853,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eric Cadesky","original_name":"Eric Cadesky","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6737d9ba624a85b8899e8e37","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4605646,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sarah Shugarman","original_name":"Sarah Shugarman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6737d9c45859f981eedf712e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4605648,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robin Lupita Bain","original_name":"Robin Lupita Bain","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6737d9dd281ac972ea448896","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266340,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Melanie MacDonald","original_name":"Melanie MacDonald","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6737d9f458bef8bc3d0e1c33","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4605649,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mat Keselman","original_name":"Mat Keselman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6737d9fea181a717eac88889","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3297740,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrew Knaggs","original_name":"Andrew Knaggs","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6737da0a5859f981eedf7154","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4605650,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elli Kozak","original_name":"Elli Kozak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6737da165859f981eedf7160","department":"Sound","job":"Boom Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Film Review: You, Forever.
