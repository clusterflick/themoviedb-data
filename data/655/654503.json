This film offers a view of what some people in Mexico face, when a lack of information, support and resources leave them with no choice but to figure out a way to survive by any means necessary. The day to day lives of many Mexicans are directly tied to their socioeconomic status, and unfortunately our protagonists have been dealt a bitter hand. This documentary is a window into the pain, hurt and circumstances that led a mother to lock her son in a room in the backyard of the family’s house.","popularity":0.0775,"poster_path":"/hbxSEysVC55wrzs99ISiqxhX62E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2018-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Prisoner in the Family","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2095316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Indra Villaseñor Amador","original_name":"Indra Villaseñor Amador","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/rrlRvTcwT38zmfMIrHLo6zhCyfQ.jpg","credit_id":"5deda06adaf57c0015eccd59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hbxSEysVC55wrzs99ISiqxhX62E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
