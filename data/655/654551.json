In a sixties-style apartment, furnished with brightly coloured objects, two men face each other.

This dreamy, playful and amorous atmosphere leads to all kinds of visions and enchantments.","popularity":0.0911,"poster_path":"/fi0mCJGGL9AeUoKF0593RqwkOhg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Heure d'Eté Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"2001-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Erè Mèla Mèla","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"One Dance, One Song","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2478576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Hoche","original_name":"Lionel Hoche","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5dedf1d4dc86470011c4d950","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2478577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Drouard","original_name":"David Drouard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5dedf1eadc86470011c4d969","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahmoud Ahmed","original_name":"Mahmoud Ahmed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dedf2420257640014543d9a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2478576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Hoche","original_name":"Lionel Hoche","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dedf2b7dc86470019c4c1db","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2473602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Wiroth","original_name":"Daniel Wiroth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dedf2c2dc86470013c4a591","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2473602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Wiroth","original_name":"Daniel Wiroth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dedf1c3303c850018b2c102","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2478576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Hoche","original_name":"Lionel Hoche","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dedf2a985da12001a4a78a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0276946","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fi0mCJGGL9AeUoKF0593RqwkOhg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
