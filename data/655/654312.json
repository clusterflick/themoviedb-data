She was trained by Cuban intelligence in polygraph countermeasures and passed a DIA polygraph screening \"test\" while spying for Cuba. Includes interviews with Montes' colleagues at DIA. The video mentions (at 16:31) that she used polygraph countermeasures to pass a 1994 DIA polygraph screening \"test,\" which facilitated her espionage: The polygraph test in 1994 made her even more dangerous. By deflecting suspicion away from her, she was freer to pursue her espionage. And to pass the polygraph, she had used a countermeasure taught to her by the Cubans.","popularity":0.4545,"poster_path":"/ofQV31wjHeo4GpqwKRhTTAwr1gw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126249,"logo_path":null,"name":"Defense Intelligence Agency","origin_country":""},{"id":126250,"logo_path":null,"name":"Multimedia Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Two Faces of Ana: Model Employee/Cuban Spy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Hagen","original_name":"Don Hagen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5deca7b36d000c001456085e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2477742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Belén Montes","original_name":"Ana Belén Montes","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/kXrQEDYQVlwrLVwsurBKgESjBtv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Former DIA Intelligence Analyst Cuba","credit_id":"5deca7c202576400145211c1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Sheyna","original_name":"Martin Sheyna","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"DIA Supervisor","credit_id":"5deca7e2eb79c20011399166","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Winneberger","original_name":"Drew Winneberger","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"DIA Chief of Security Activities","credit_id":"5deca7f8daf57c0015eb67bc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2477746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lourdes Talbot","original_name":"Lourdes Talbot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/njydFvcOteZscQF2ZUvTGBsJyTo.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"DIA Analyst","credit_id":"5deca8006d000c001755d8e0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Smith","original_name":"Steve Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"DIA Analyst Mexico","credit_id":"5deca83385da12001448762a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darren Guzzone","original_name":"Darren Guzzone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deca8a132489b0016c14145","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477753,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Renee Straszewaki","original_name":"Renee Straszewaki","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deca8d785da12001448776a","department":"Production","job":"Supervising Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darren Guzzone","original_name":"Darren Guzzone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deca88885da12001a484912","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477754,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wayne Clague","original_name":"Wayne Clague","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deca8e9158c8500158152cd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1114943,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lisa Feit","original_name":"Lisa Feit","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deca8b532489b0016c14161","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darren Guzzone","original_name":"Darren Guzzone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deca8980d9f5a0018262bb5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11405060","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bW7NThNvdIjf69BXgcUbUprnSJ4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ofQV31wjHeo4GpqwKRhTTAwr1gw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":231324,"name":"spy story"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
