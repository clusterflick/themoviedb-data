On the way, a sidewalk salesman sells him a fur coat which Leon learns later had been stolen from his neighbor's wife. He tries to sneak the coat back into the apartment but the husband catches him, and Leon is unable to explain why he is there. A lot of rain must fall in Leon's life, and it does, before everything is resolved... somewhat. He still doesn't have a present for Dorothy, a fact that does not go unnoticed by her.","popularity":0.6533,"poster_path":"/xdmSplcATM4skPT8s3fHTE1EUVh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birthday Blues","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Errol","original_name":"Leon Errol","popularity":0.1492,"profile_path":"/8jV6d5rKmmXn69TRbm4Ndehdrpr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Leon Errol","credit_id":"5dee349485da1200174b1acb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Granger","original_name":"Dorothy Granger","popularity":0.2115,"profile_path":"/3iNHKiEQ0wx2bTYMzG2YdRz28HK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Dorothy Errol","credit_id":"5dee34a4dc86470019c53c4d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elaine Riley","original_name":"Elaine Riley","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":"/cpF5bYczGW9YkmIz2MJCjaXqQZY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mitzi Williams - Neighbor's Wife","credit_id":"5dee34b585da12001a4adcc6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence Tierney","original_name":"Lawrence Tierney","popularity":0.5318,"profile_path":"/crtpxUAnPrZFSrLjbsTUTdGn72W.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Tom Williams - Neighbor","credit_id":"5dee34c5688cd000171f8cca","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Harvey","original_name":"Harry Harvey","popularity":0.3506,"profile_path":"/gfBTGsPJGlbQ7ThZKPdwb0pYC5w.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Harvey - a Salesman","credit_id":"5dee34d3daf57c0019edf949","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Strang","original_name":"Harry Strang","popularity":0.1074,"profile_path":"/a7lkLx0oHLFPMCqoB6iS4OtAFU6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Police Lieutenant","credit_id":"5dee34e1688cd000171f8ce5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Hopton","original_name":"Russell Hopton","popularity":0.1659,"profile_path":"/kAkVnyU0D9phlK8FmmcsYwhz8XQ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Thief","credit_id":"5dee34ff85da1200174b1b93","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Glover","original_name":"Edmund Glover","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/q7aIsLMJK8qu2aHMTw51SAzZDko.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mac - a Policeman","credit_id":"5dee3512dc86470019c53ce8","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":194924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hal Yates","original_name":"Hal Yates","popularity":0.1723,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c732c5f29d66005626b36e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":194924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hal Yates","original_name":"Hal Yates","popularity":0.1723,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dee342785da1200174b19f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0037542","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2205,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xdmSplcATM4skPT8s3fHTE1EUVh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1470},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gA8Z9mNuPtzvrU44KXUphhJYLcv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1945-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
