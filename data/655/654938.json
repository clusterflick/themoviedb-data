Originally sold to the public as a pandemic affecting homosexuals and heterosexuals alike, by 1990 it had become apparent that the risk of infection was far higher for gay men.\r In a sad yet sometimes hilarious story of mutual misunderstanding, politicians, gay rights activists and campaigners describe the attitudes, from moral outrage and homophobia to a desire not to offend, that prevented the formulation of a policy that would protect those most at risk from Aids.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End of Innocence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2479781,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nigel Evans","original_name":"Nigel Evans","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df0158c85da12001a4dcf8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
