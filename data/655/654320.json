The portraits from the world of the milieu of whores and suitors, of sexual violence, were a taboo break. His brutal depiction of war shook society - he was a ruthless chronicler of his day. In contrast, private life with his wife and children shows the gentle side of the provocative painter. Nicola Graef's film \"Otto Dix - The Ruthless Painter\" is dedicated to this interplay of life and work. Like few other artists, Dix used his personal experiences and experiences as the basis for his work.","popularity":0.0902,"poster_path":"/nnb9RlC1FOF0H0aXJPTodCEYoef.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2620,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lona media","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Otto Dix: The Ruthless Painter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1875482,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susanne Brand","original_name":"Susanne Brand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5decc11a158c8500158162d4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":67327,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexander Rott","original_name":"Alexander Rott","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5decc1390d9f5a0013262493","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67325,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicola Graef","original_name":"Nicola Graef","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5decc0ef6d000c00145621ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67325,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicola Graef","original_name":"Nicola Graef","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5decc105eee18600128c4c41","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nnb9RlC1FOF0H0aXJPTodCEYoef.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2017-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
