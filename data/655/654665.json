Over the space of a year, 16 women were murdered in the Iranian city of Mashad. Because the victims were lured into the killer's traps, the press soon called these the \"spider killings.\" All but one of the victims had previously been arrested for prostitution and drug-related crimes. When a 39-year-old contractor is arrested and confesses to the crimes, he claims divine support for his crimes. His mother, wife, son, and many neighbors agree. AND ALONG CAME A SPIDER visits with the families of the victims, with the perpetrator and his family, and with prostitutes in this holy city. Most chillingly, the killer's son proudly re-enacts a murder, and suggests that he wants to grow up to be like his father. This is a chilling film about cycles of moral vengeance.","popularity":0.1763,"poster_path":"/gEYSOPvq0M2eOCD5cnarJeSxgNk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2003-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And Along Came a Spider","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","title":"Va ankaboot amad","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2478952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haleh Anvari","original_name":"Haleh Anvari","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5dee97b6daf57c0013ee9e67","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2478953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saeed Hanaei","original_name":"Saeed Hanaei","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5dee97c3688cd0001220382f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2478954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roya Karimi","original_name":"Roya Karimi","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5dee97d0dc86470013c59d3b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159771,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maziar Bahari","original_name":"Maziar Bahari","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/13v3jvIGPyLQ783T5LKfz7s5PK3.jpg","credit_id":"5dee97980257640014557062","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159771,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maziar Bahari","original_name":"Maziar Bahari","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/13v3jvIGPyLQ783T5LKfz7s5PK3.jpg","credit_id":"5dee97a4dc86470019c5f87b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159771,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maziar Bahari","original_name":"Maziar Bahari","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/13v3jvIGPyLQ783T5LKfz7s5PK3.jpg","credit_id":"5dee97e2025764001455719c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":81150,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sara Bernstein","original_name":"Sara Bernstein","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/lHxgVjuHFdionBpk8BdQMf3Q95z.jpg","credit_id":"5dee97f4dc86470013c59d7b","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":945162,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lisa Heller","original_name":"Lisa Heller","popularity":0.1368,"profile_path":"/5UQABpvdcyD1hymHzrZoN6lNvq4.jpg","credit_id":"5dee980285da12001a4b696d","department":"Production","job":"Supervising Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1238136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sheila Nevins","original_name":"Sheila Nevins","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":"/a9QK5bZlNB0zx2RTROOixTA3o5d.jpg","credit_id":"5dee980f85da1200174bc54d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159771,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maziar Bahari","original_name":"Maziar Bahari","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/13v3jvIGPyLQ783T5LKfz7s5PK3.jpg","credit_id":"5dee981e85da1200174bc573","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159771,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maziar Bahari","original_name":"Maziar Bahari","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/13v3jvIGPyLQ783T5LKfz7s5PK3.jpg","credit_id":"5dee982b688cd0001220389f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":935135,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hosein Mahdavi","original_name":"Hosein Mahdavi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dee983bdc86470019c5f992","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0354378","wikidata_id":"Q20111261","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gEYSOPvq0M2eOCD5cnarJeSxgNk.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":507}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fa","note":"","release_date":"2003-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
