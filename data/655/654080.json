Balkans.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/4YIAofyv4GSlWrvHcCv3V2IbuGg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2005-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Portrait
