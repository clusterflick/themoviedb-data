In return for restoring and old oil paiting by an obscure artist, Benjamin Brooke offers to represent and propel him into stardom. Claiming that his employer is a rich and influential man, Benjamin convinces initially hesitant Francis.  At a private showing organised by Benjamin, Francis’ paintings sell out, marking the beginning of his artistic legacy. But the price Francis pays for his fame is high indeed – he has traded places with the Gentleman and is now trapped inside the painting he restored.","popularity":0.4205,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A struggling painter takes on a commission that promises him fame, but may cost him his soul.","title":"Restoration","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":966556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milo Cawthorne","original_name":"Milo Cawthorne","popularity":0.2675,"profile_path":"/4BRryDvdn2evnXtKb7ZWbOyya2y.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Francis","credit_id":"5df026741dbc880016ac3751","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":186469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alistair Browning","original_name":"Alistair Browning","popularity":0.1251,"profile_path":"/dsmzpp5iW5pwb8gNvjlPnPzvAMK.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Benjamin","credit_id":"5df0267f0257640016579628","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1630369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Smith","original_name":"Greg Smith","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":"/rLalld11cMcX6QZVrLntTOi5D5z.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Gentleman","credit_id":"5df026924b0c6300134a5aef","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1510651,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Duncan Cole","original_name":"Duncan Cole","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fad6bf3fe160017df37736","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2479830,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luke Watkinson","original_name":"Luke Watkinson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df0260d6a34480012c723a6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76838,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nick Ward","original_name":"Nick Ward","popularity":0.1101,"profile_path":"/1MbS7UeeI8pmJDzwNzA2cczr8Qs.jpg","credit_id":"5df0263f85da1200144e5433","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":85758,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Edward Sampson","original_name":"Edward Sampson","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df0265bdc86470013c82b46","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":76843,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michelle Turner","original_name":"Michelle Turner","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df0262f1dbc880016ac3713","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359249,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Lyn Bergquist","original_name":"Lyn Bergquist","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df0266685da12001a4de345","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1269284,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tim Tsiklauri","original_name":"Tim Tsiklauri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df02600dc86470013c82b02","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1269284,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tim Tsiklauri","original_name":"Tim Tsiklauri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df025f985da12001a4de2c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1269285,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicola Peeperkoorn","original_name":"Nicola Peeperkoorn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df0261aeda4b7001803b04c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
