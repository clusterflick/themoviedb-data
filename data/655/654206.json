Daniel Barenboim has served as its music director since 1992, and in 2000 the orchestra appointed him Chief Conductor for Life. Having already performed important cycles such as Beethoven, Brahms and Schumann together, Daniel Barenboim and the Staatskapelle turned their focus toward Anton Bruckner's last six Symphonies, performed in the Philharmonie Berlin in the course of only one week in June 2010. This music is more serious and more significant than one had thought, the Berliner Zeitung summarized in its review of Daniel Barenboims celebrated Bruckner cycle with the Staatskapelle Berlin. Bruckners unfinished Symphony No. 9 brought to an end, in a poignant manner, the work of one of the greatest symphonic composers of the Classic-Romantic era.","popularity":0.4746,"poster_path":"/xASOGS3OmIzggMSoEdYVROcEHCb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bruckner Symphony No. 9","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Barenboim","original_name":"Daniel Barenboim","popularity":0.1008,"profile_path":"/pNoHzRlu3vNQmQsB7XrmrFYjOd1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"5dec02fe6d000c00175527ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Staatskapelle Berlin","original_name":"Staatskapelle Berlin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ff55793b865eb003eb14008","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enrique Sánchez Lansch","original_name":"Enrique Sánchez Lansch","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dec0372daf57c0013ea7830","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2065334,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anton Bruckner","original_name":"Anton Bruckner","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/oZn5Ou1ej4RsRn3KDOquJv0N2yp.jpg","credit_id":"5dec0380daf57c0015eac2bf","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xASOGS3OmIzggMSoEdYVROcEHCb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258963,"name":"classical concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
