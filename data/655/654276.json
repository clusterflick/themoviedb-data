He was an inspired and committed multi-media artist who worked with the Impressionists and had a tempestuous relationship with Vincent van Gogh.

Later, he challenged the colonial authorities and the Catholic Church in defence of the indigenous people, dying in the Marquesas Islands in 1903, sick, impoverished and alone.","popularity":0.4894,"poster_path":"/4MV1eshzuLB0khwp3YDnkKBe1d3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":126243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gauguin Films Limited","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gauguin: A Dangerous Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominic West","original_name":"Dominic West","popularity":1.2049,"profile_path":"/6y2M3EWslBPwPlugEFg8XDHfSJ0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Voice of Paul Gauguin","credit_id":"5dec5c9deb79c20013395b39","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Tai Gauguin","original_name":"Marcel Tai Gauguin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5dec5cb1eee18600168bee44","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mette Gauguin","original_name":"Mette Gauguin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5dec5cbd6d000c0017559f8c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tai Shan Schierenberg","original_name":"Tai Shan Schierenberg","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":"/v08vaaXdL7A93mFVXPUuDPDNVWs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5dec5ccd6905fb001414cf07","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyla Vaeau","original_name":"Tyla Vaeau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5dec5cdcdaf57c0019eb14aa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1982282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kehinde Wiley","original_name":"Kehinde Wiley","popularity":0.1491,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5dec5cea6d000c001455d2e9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2296414,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Gauguin","original_name":"Paul Gauguin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/e7MOPF06ksft31RDL54LhGPTLps.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6393e5eb2cefc2007c1e160f","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2134278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patricia Wheatley","original_name":"Patricia Wheatley","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dec5d00daf57c0013eb061e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1727596,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin Rosenbaum","original_name":"Martin Rosenbaum","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dec5d1a025764001851dd51","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":225419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Low","original_name":"Adam Low","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dec5d35daf57c0019eb14c8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19870880","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iDnwOyzvJPfVEoL3etB1nrBLQ4r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4MV1eshzuLB0khwp3YDnkKBe1d3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aiv9HP838VaPRAz6YNE50jcOUp8.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1476},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/85XKT50RovIkLQNN0le76F5wJW8.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2936,"name":"artists' life"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":259965,"name":"post-impressionist"},{"id":259994,"name":"gauguin"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
