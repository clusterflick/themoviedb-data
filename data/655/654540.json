Based on Carles last script completed in 2000, entitled 'Mona MC Gill et son vieux père malade', Charles Binamés documentary, which took slightly over two years to film, gives us a friendly, penetrating look of a brave, lucid creator confronted with suffering and the perspective of death. Although the subject is grave, we see a stong will to live and to create. A movie shrouded in all the light and love of Chloé Ste-Marie, the famous directors companion of 25 years.","popularity":0.3098,"poster_path":"/bRl3KjYYYlYcXUGADUjMWYH1hoG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98425,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amazone Film","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2005-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gilles Carle ou l'indomptable imaginaire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilles Carle","original_name":"Gilles Carle","popularity":0.1671,"profile_path":"/uWOHFoetNKgop5rL19owXRxiz36.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dedd54b303c850018b27511","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1177369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chloé Sainte-Marie","original_name":"Chloé Sainte-Marie","popularity":0.0902,"profile_path":"/zRbbFV9IIcZ8erjhDc2seXFZf6f.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5dedd568dc86470019c49a70","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Pilon","original_name":"Donald Pilon","popularity":0.0947,"profile_path":"/nWFCI6m4YOIO2sajSPoQFs86LsF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5dedd82d85da12001a4a48f5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Binamé","original_name":"Charles Binamé","popularity":0.2198,"profile_path":"/dPkOfqGACDjbIXbk4Yelb3wu4OW.jpg","credit_id":"5dedd53bdaf57c0015ed42e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Binamé","original_name":"Charles Binamé","popularity":0.2198,"profile_path":"/dPkOfqGACDjbIXbk4Yelb3wu4OW.jpg","credit_id":"5dedd604dc86470013c471a9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2022202,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeannine Gagné","original_name":"Jeannine Gagné","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/gfGMW7HaQT8KrJsFVEL88CFYZ1R.jpg","credit_id":"5dedd85285da12001a4a4941","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":10752,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dominique Fortin","original_name":"Dominique Fortin","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dedd96502576400145417b9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Binamé","original_name":"Charles Binamé","popularity":0.2198,"profile_path":"/dPkOfqGACDjbIXbk4Yelb3wu4OW.jpg","credit_id":"5f8ee08511386c003604f0a1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8727308","wikidata_id":"Q51476242","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bRl3KjYYYlYcXUGADUjMWYH1hoG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/levMVli8cXltYFMQVcUyriRVB8W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
