These fundamental questions are central to Aisha’s inspiring story. The extraverted, creative Kwakwaka’wakw girl doesn’t hesitate to question the institutional capacity to consider her ambitions. With the support of her mother, Gunargie, who was sent to residential school, Aisha wants to leave public school, which is poorly adapted to her temperament and cultural preoccupations. Revealing a sharp observational sense and driven by an energetic protagonist, Another Word for Learning asks probing questions about the foundations of education in Canada, while painting a touching portrait of an inspiring mother-daughter relationship.","popularity":0.1231,"poster_path":"/vHbIYHrzNKldYYp0wMuEbKiqUdF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126219,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema Politica Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":110213,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wide Open Exposure Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Word for Learning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2046058,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Renaud","original_name":"Nicolas Renaud","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deba87e32489b0014bf7b52","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477204,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pirouz Nemati","original_name":"Pirouz Nemati","popularity":0.1551,"profile_path":"/sWkgmkUxOuRfZU6gEuvU45P9Nwn.jpg","credit_id":"5deba8a032489b0014bf7b8f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jadis Mariette Dumas","original_name":"Jadis Mariette Dumas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deba7b532489b0012bf8b10","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477201,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kaayla Whachell","original_name":"Kaayla Whachell","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deba84f32489b0016bfcffb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477200,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Svetla Turnin","original_name":"Svetla Turnin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deba82a6d000c0014546b3d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2188185,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jon Bap","original_name":"Jon Bap","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5debac436d000c001254083d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jadis Mariette Dumas","original_name":"Jadis Mariette Dumas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deba7cd32489b0016bfcf0a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477207,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eliza Kavtion","original_name":"Eliza Kavtion","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5debac22158c850018801cbd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1844973,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Leon","original_name":"Chris Leon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5debac5f6d000c001254087a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658719,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amy Miller","original_name":"Amy Miller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deba80132489b0014bf7acb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477203,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Boban Chaldovich","original_name":"Boban Chaldovich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deba88fdaf57c0019e9d180","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jadis Mariette Dumas","original_name":"Jadis Mariette Dumas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5deba7a26d000c0014546a74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477208,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Laraaji","original_name":"Laraaji","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5debac30daf57c0013e9d691","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2477202,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Farhad Ghaderi","original_name":"Farhad Ghaderi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec6d78dd8b3a03f932617b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.647,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vHbIYHrzNKldYYp0wMuEbKiqUdF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":518}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
