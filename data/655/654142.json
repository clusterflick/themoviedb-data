Having lost his sight and hearing and living in a retirement home, he carried on doing the only thing that mattered to him — writing — until his final breath. This film is a testament to the value of writings that tell the unpalatable truths of the 20th century. To evoke the gritty texture of the Soviet world, Sententia is shot on 16mm black and white film.","popularity":0.2985,"poster_path":"/ioEoGq30jpqOmPd5F3gb6ZBVsAn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rock
