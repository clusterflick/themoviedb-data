Despite language and national divides, she connects with Ashot and Karine who steadfastly bare their struggles, becoming her chosen family as she searches for the past and finds revealing attachments to the foreign yet familiar country. In her poem-like letters, she surmises the meaning of the past, foothold in an uncertain present and a firm, even hopeful resolve for the future.","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":"/dYQNwWsMHbiWbtgo44HgqRAbVSq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Come Rain or Shine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zeynep Güzel","original_name":"Zeynep Güzel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5debfeb76d000c00145526cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1784822,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ronit Meranda","original_name":"Ronit Meranda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5debffaceb79c2001138c564","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zeynep Güzel","original_name":"Zeynep Güzel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5debfef3eb79c2001838c400","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10015222","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1984,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dYQNwWsMHbiWbtgo44HgqRAbVSq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1417}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
