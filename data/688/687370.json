He asks Mado, a friend, an unlikely security guard of abandoned hangars in an industrial wasteland, for the keys to a warehouse for rehearsals. Sweet-natured, Mado lends them to him, but in exchange she wants to play a part – she would like so much to be in it. Faced by such insistence, Benoît ends up giving in.","popularity":0.0486,"poster_path":"/TZDFWpc5EcrzVUu9GB8EeF02Qp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Et alors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Le Masne","original_name":"Christophe Le Masne","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":"/vPVdSPUHRfqnOUMRXGPC38Oqi0q.jpg","credit_id":"5e7f9fdcafe2240015752068","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0958836","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/TZDFWpc5EcrzVUu9GB8EeF02Qp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":538}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
