Billy is hired for an array of jobs, including office clerk and xylophone player, but always quits just before being fired. He then finds work in a restaurant where he is required to dress as a knight in armor and pose as a statue. On one occasion, Gordon, Helen, and Billy's romantic rival, Tom, enter the restaurant, and Billy is nearly fired when Helen recognizes him. Meanwhile, Gordon plans to merge one of his railroads with a company that is in a dispute with Tom's uncle, an unprincipled financier. Acting on the promise of a generous cash reward, Tom is determined to steal documents relating to the merger.","popularity":0.4101,"poster_path":"/rHetsAEmEmAzw6QgGGyC4mFlNhN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Players-Lasky Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's his best in a long time","title":"You're Fired","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Reid","original_name":"Wallace Reid","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/dE0MD7mJe8VmRIxoxvfTyqrAl3p.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Billy Deering","credit_id":"5e80dc872a210c00172a434f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wanda Hawley","original_name":"Wanda Hawley","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":"/hDLCnGfPRTwp6egZxHn7EIRsdaB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Helen Rogers","credit_id":"5e80dc902a210c00172a4358","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1384808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Woodward","original_name":"Henry Woodward","popularity":0.0909,"profile_path":"/8yNOnGxTupUQnfEVflOwXizP2fI.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"5e80dc964e67420011d9909d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodore Roberts","original_name":"Theodore Roberts","popularity":0.285,"profile_path":"/zyNQbifLkL42CaVvRKh2tG659q4.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gordon Rogers","credit_id":"5e80dc9d4e67420016d97f53","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2583020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Mason","original_name":"Lillian Mason","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. Oglethorpe","credit_id":"5e80dca489b56100153ff38a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Prior","original_name":"Herbert Prior","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/wN0WTT9TqPt6JvI5JsnGhp2yoMN.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Horace Graham","credit_id":"621aaac319ab59001c7421c7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Hatton","original_name":"Raymond Hatton","popularity":0.1989,"profile_path":"/eTiQiDcMhwD3DCE6yINa7RKd5NJ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Orchestra Leader","credit_id":"621aaad28ac3d0001b92586e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3445208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Lesta","original_name":"William Lesta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Restaurant Proprietor","credit_id":"621aaae4a8858700421fbb4d","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Cruze","original_name":"James Cruze","popularity":0.2053,"profile_path":"/rTDilm5WrU4I8n4abBUucJGoAkY.jpg","credit_id":"5e80dc68498ef90013c90299","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148790,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Clara Genevieve Kennedy","original_name":"Clara Genevieve Kennedy","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e80dc7089b56100133fec57","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932396,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Urson","original_name":"Frank Urson","popularity":0.0647,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e80dc790bc5290012ef552c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":792498,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"O.
