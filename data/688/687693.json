Getting a single room, they pretend they are married to satisfy the concerns of the hotel manager though Jimmy sleeps on a cot in the hall. Another hotel guest, Bruce Terring misconstrues the situation and later when he meets Diana his scandalous interpretation of her escapade infuriates the young woman. She decides to teach him a lesson and show him that \"seeing is not always believing\" by placing him in a similar unusual position. She hires an acting couple to frame a badger game on Bruce, but they double-cross her, forcing Diana into an extorting scheme from which Bruce must rescue her, resulting in a snappy but happy ending for Bruce and Diana.","popularity":0.3986,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16101,"logo_path":"/2yI4rjPZ1I7TLZ2UWvTtXifYEnw.png","name":"Metro Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seeing's Believing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viola Dana","original_name":"Viola Dana","popularity":0.0829,"profile_path":"/xkE1eRGSmOdgi4IPfgSWzRiYrEZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Diana Webster","credit_id":"5e80e66789b56100133ffa05","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Forrest","original_name":"Allan Forrest","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/jhGHhMlLlprXT3VBQuvVHFw9Ht1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bruce Terring","credit_id":"5e80e66d2a210c00172a5136","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrude Astor","original_name":"Gertrude Astor","popularity":0.33,"profile_path":"/jjIoqFS6mmfZFlhX8pcBhPVzIBJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Aunt Sue","credit_id":"5e80e6732a210c00152a4b23","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philo McCullough","original_name":"Philo McCullough","popularity":0.2428,"profile_path":"/3rRW4z7GBHrXMzGNvTJldipaLBF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jimmy Harrison","credit_id":"5e80e679498ef90017c9099f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Goodwin","original_name":"Harold Goodwin","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":"/iBjhsEdnsSs9Ll14rgKrSl33iff.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hack Webster","credit_id":"5e80e680ef48890015f2be80","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Connelly","original_name":"Edward Connelly","popularity":0.2155,"profile_path":"/zUTXrIDx9gjhiveMt8kXycDWF7V.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Henry Scribbins","credit_id":"66cb421005a16d09d01038f4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josephine Crowell","original_name":"Josephine Crowell","popularity":0.0869,"profile_path":"/tWAM1i3JvmtUQ3BnKXo8mhHknN1.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Martha Scribbins","credit_id":"66cb422c7dd54f18f6749b72","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Kenny","original_name":"Colin Kenny","popularity":0.1413,"profile_path":"/8zW8KNpOtiQxx9lTugciQbsl4gV.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mr. Reed","credit_id":"66cb4242754c099633d3ed76","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2392813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Morse","original_name":"Grace Morse","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/cr2X2Q75d1H35HqoxbtD9cJtxFu.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Mrs. Reed","credit_id":"66cb425610023a9e213ec48c","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1734695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David H.
