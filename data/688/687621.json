During the search for his keys, he gets distracted by the daily routine of the neighbourhood and ends up in various adventures. With all sorts and conditions of residents: a slick barber in a garage box, a side-tracked gold digger, a lonely cripple and an old acquaintance. The local residents in this deadpan drama do not have much, but at least they have each other.","popularity":0.0682,"poster_path":"/gXIypApp4520gCvgcfYkp0qWyQJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54890,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nederlandse Filmacademie","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shalky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilias Addab","original_name":"Ilias Addab","popularity":0.1725,"profile_path":"/71Oq5lev2SUkmr0OikTjy6n9BJN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e80ae6fce5d820017ea2c08","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mamoun Elyounoussi","original_name":"Mamoun Elyounoussi","popularity":0.2288,"profile_path":"/aChpXcNnrRZd6M65cBVrwmMyJw8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e80ae75a4f03c0012b7184a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yorke Mulder-Bhangoo","original_name":"Yorke Mulder-Bhangoo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e80ae7dce5d820014ea275e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annica Muller","original_name":"Annica Muller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e80ae8276484100113dbb82","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582816,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lance Hossein Tangestani","original_name":"Lance Hossein Tangestani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e80ae57a4f03c0012b71814","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582809,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Douwe Nagelmaker","original_name":"Douwe Nagelmaker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e80ae5fa4f03c0012b7182c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10789870","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1131,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/gXIypApp4520gCvgcfYkp0qWyQJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
