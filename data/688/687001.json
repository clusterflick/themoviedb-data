He is trying to sell the coconuts he has picked to the tourists to make a living, while dreaming of meeting a woman who can help him to a better future. She is a tourist in a foreign country - and she is a filmmaker. 'Low Season' describes an unequal and problemtic encounter, but does so in a form based on exchange and mutual trust, which the dreamy, fragmented film not only reflects but enters into a direct dialoge with. 'Low Season' is hopefully a promise of longer films to come from Mie Mollerup who has made her mark with an artistic and humane vision in a both compact and complex form.","popularity":0.0629,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Low Season","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580627,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mie Mollerup","original_name":"Mie Mollerup","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7e175afea0d772afca3cab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11825220","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
