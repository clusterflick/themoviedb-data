Over the course of a year, Wilson set out to document— and accentuate—his surroundings through camera filters, angles, repetition, and audio. The end result is a hypnotic journey through the hidden wonders and beauties of the Northwest forests, in vivid colors and immaculate black-and-whites.","popularity":0.2177,"poster_path":"/fZdux84GwtsI6X2nIhWCiCbhTs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home in the Woods","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2581786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brandon Wilson","original_name":"Brandon Wilson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xIjAAWPP9o5H8mT8X6rXdpShrFm.jpg","credit_id":"5e7f7aa770309f001761b2bf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2581786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brandon Wilson","original_name":"Brandon Wilson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xIjAAWPP9o5H8mT8X6rXdpShrFm.jpg","credit_id":"5e7f7960a275020016eee63a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2581786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brandon Wilson","original_name":"Brandon Wilson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xIjAAWPP9o5H8mT8X6rXdpShrFm.jpg","credit_id":"5e7f7ab070309f001261d79b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8891532","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t0Ow3vjbaj38JTDVqwxWXhY3hiy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fZdux84GwtsI6X2nIhWCiCbhTs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1897,"name":"oregon, usa"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Portland International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ann Arbor Film Festival Livestream","release_date":"2020-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Prismatic Ground","release_date":"2021-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
