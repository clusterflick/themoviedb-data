Maar’s extraordinary life saw her working alongside the greatest names in the Parisian art scene; she was also the lover of Picasso and the wife of Georges Bataille. Toppling conventions and shattering norms, Dora Maar breathed strength and character back into the image of 20th-century women. Hailed by critics, this film is an intimate portrayal that handles its subject with skill and sensitivity.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/3jeHYWnvZjdSwpBpmdjH48SrJjI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dora Maar: Between Light and Shade","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2583240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dora Maar","original_name":"Dora Maar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e81179b0bc5290016efa771","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1613918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie-Ève de Grave","original_name":"Marie-Ève de Grave","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e8117836d97e60018c701b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3jeHYWnvZjdSwpBpmdjH48SrJjI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"French\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"French\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"National Gallery of Art: International Festival of Films on Art: Selections","release_date":"2020-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
