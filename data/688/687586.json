One day his wife leaves him, telling him that she believes he will never be anything more than a teacher. Depressed, Preston is visited by the ghost of Ingmar Bergman who tells him to use his misery as the material for a great film just as he did in his 'Scenes from a Marriage'. Taking Bergman's advice, Preston decides to make a film, in an attempt to prove his wife wrong and in the hope of winning her back. Using the facilities of the school and the students as his crew, Preston shoots his film but soon finds that he is visited by the ghosts of series of famous, dead European directors who offer him advice on how to improve his film. Following their wise but disparate counsel his film goes wildly out of control and becomes a huge, sprawling, incoherent mess.","popularity":0.1596,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":116640,"logo_path":null,"name":"City Lights Films","origin_country":""},{"id":131325,"logo_path":null,"name":"Framstore Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":131326,"logo_path":null,"name":"European Film College (EFC)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Director","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Waitt","original_name":"Chris Waitt","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":"/7Zd0qJv4Zy4BH1a47MRQW2lk9wW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Preston Ennis","credit_id":"5e809254a4f03c0017b6dd2d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1435798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Celia Diane","original_name":"Celia Diane","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/2UjvTXAVQErSN2lYuOEb3VG7rcp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sophie Beauvoir","credit_id":"5e80926e76484100133db2af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1518801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidsel Siem Koch","original_name":"Sidsel Siem Koch","popularity":0.2197,"profile_path":"/3jed0p49UNic41YEJJxKZhyoPFc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Freja","credit_id":"5e809277a127e5001456dcda","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1261131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Fisher-Becker","original_name":"Simon Fisher-Becker","popularity":0.1547,"profile_path":"/wt7FOsSF0DDIkQnsiyQbb9G75QG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alfred Hitchcock","credit_id":"5e809298a4f03c0012b6e9ba","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Boissevain","original_name":"Robin Boissevain","popularity":0.1976,"profile_path":"/ywHAmD5FKpGKhpAqpRKHJp3zj4O.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Robin","credit_id":"5e8092a976484100133db38a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Cassells","original_name":"Patrick Cassells","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Police man","credit_id":"5e8092bece5d820014e9fef5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orkhan Ata","original_name":"Orxan Ata","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5e8092cdce5d820017ea0355","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582675,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Federico Allegretta","original_name":"Federico Allegretta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e809301a127e5001856a3f1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Waitt","original_name":"Chris Waitt","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":"/7Zd0qJv4Zy4BH1a47MRQW2lk9wW.jpg","credit_id":"5e8092d8a4f03c0017b6dd9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2277790,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Malgorzata Maria Pronko","original_name":"Malgorzata Maria Pronko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e80931476484100153df11b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Waitt","original_name":"Chris Waitt","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":"/7Zd0qJv4Zy4BH1a47MRQW2lk9wW.jpg","credit_id":"5e8092f0af85de00195ffad8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2016867,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nick Wright","original_name":"Nick Wright","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/bZgxdpfr8gkYXJmGbFrnKc6IXWS.jpg","credit_id":"5e809327a127e5001456ddaa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1928974,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bernardo Angeletti","original_name":"Bernardo Angeletti","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e80933b76484100113d8f41","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5273758,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul C.
