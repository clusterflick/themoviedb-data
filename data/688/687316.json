Each with a vastly different story, they are all linked by their displacement and the sole choice of call center work they have in a country that is so unfamiliar and oftentimes frightening, yet other times a ray of hope. Tijuana becomes their home, a place defined by the border but yet defiant towards it, a no man's land where everything and everyone feels transient. These characters paint a picture of love, loss and longing - for home, for an American Dream deferred, and for justice.","popularity":0.1328,"poster_path":"/ru4vtlJ7H3NcLTsyEOlClN2K7Ju.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call Center Blues","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1106893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Geeta Gandbhir","original_name":"Geeta Gandbhir","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/Aep5viOLzys01FhPiOesPOiJJMy.jpg","credit_id":"5e7f6e5de635710017598cfc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2029973,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jessica Devaney","original_name":"Jessica Devaney","popularity":0.0786,"profile_path":"/uTRTh4Pk2usM3LeGEmFrrtOkueI.jpg","credit_id":"5e7f6e79a275020011eed467","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2581739,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ryan Chanatry","original_name":"Ryan Chanatry","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7f6e9fe72fe8001162d734","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2581742,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Holmes","original_name":"Anna Holmes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7f6ecc2dc44e0011fd8c06","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1222928,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gena Konstantinakos","original_name":"Gena Konstantinakos","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7f6ef2a275020011eed4d4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1637932,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Asad Faruqi","original_name":"Asad Faruqi","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7f6f0ca275020011eed4e9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1851277,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Viridiana Lieberman","original_name":"Viridiana Lieberman","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7f6f2470309f001461a284","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2132378,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Filipe Messeder","original_name":"Filipe Messeder","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7f6f3c70309f001261ca9f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2412609,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Laura Heinzinger","original_name":"Laura Heinzinger","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7f6f64a410c8001852f7d7","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11224254","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uZO8kfH9IzIOPqqIe2y9eaE3NGz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ru4vtlJ7H3NcLTsyEOlClN2K7Ju.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Prime SXSW 2020 Film Festival Collection","release_date":"2020-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Palm Springs International Shortfest","release_date":"2020-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
