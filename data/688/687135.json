Objects and devices become bodily and manipulative. The magician is a composed cartoon machine repeating tricks and equations. When products become prosthetics does the accessory take some emotional control? A creative trance. A collaborative force.

A filmic exhibit and retail site that morphed into an experimental piece of moving image occupying the dual space between utility and art.","popularity":0.0588,"poster_path":"/bu829gVYFFqUuTuUT0CigLZYsvZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plasma Vista","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1482413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miss Cairo","original_name":"Miss Cairo","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e7e998c9652200018cfc29a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2581145,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luke Fraser","original_name":"Luke Fraser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7e99dc9652200016cfd0a3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2581144,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ed Tucker","original_name":"Ed Tucker","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/aSU6HD1ka2NqyMWpAT2TPVyveEP.jpg","credit_id":"5e7e99c44f9a99001633f296","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2581142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Cockings","original_name":"Sarah Cockings","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7e999e4f9a99001433e9e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2581143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harriet Fleuriot","original_name":"Harriet Fleuriot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7e99b0c68b6900134126e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bu829gVYFFqUuTuUT0CigLZYsvZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
