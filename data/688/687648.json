They wake up, they walk by the corridors. A few others are exercizing at the living room. Some assistants work at the kitchen, or at the laundry. The president is looking after the vacancies. The psychologist interviews some old people, analyzing their memory. Sometimes they go on a trip by bus. It's a different day. They used to be country people. The major part of those old people have missed already the idea of Time in a strange Space for them. There's a great desire to communicate, they don't want to be alone.
