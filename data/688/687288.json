So he follows in the footsteps of Eik Skaløe, the lead singer of Steppeulvene, who committed suicide in India in 1968. And he would like to do so all the way. Luxury-loving Mikkel is not so wild about Johan's wild life experiments, but nonetheless joins him on the trip, which takes the two Danes across a magical, wild and unpredictable India. A crazy trip, reserved for those who are out of their minds.","popularity":0.083,"poster_path":"/hZ7AgHxBCyz0DRgL1y9w6sgJzSw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131279,"logo_path":null,"name":"Framework
