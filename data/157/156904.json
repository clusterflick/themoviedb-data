Fanie (Frederik Burgers), a struggling producer/composer, needs to write a winning song to keep his agent happy and his company in work, but, alas, he’s lacking inspiration. Until, that is, his musical partner Ben (Al Debbo) starts dreaming – and singing in  his sleep – about a beautiful girl, all in operetta style. Seizing this Cupid-sent gift, Fanie secretly tapes Ben’s songs. The delighted agent pushes for more songs to produce a full-scale musical, which means Fanie has to keep Ben dreaming, and stay awake to tape the songs. All goes well until Ben suddenly stops dreaming. Fanie’s attempts to restart the flow of inspiration fail until Cupid’s arrow comes to the rescue again – only this time, it is Fanie who falls in love.","popularity":0.0479,"poster_path":"/xu5yTQyQO7mRlzp4LJqZ4mtzbu3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Afrikaanse Rolprentproduksies Killarney","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"1952-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Always In My Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1162560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Debbo","original_name":"Al Debbo","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/lEUQgC7d3tPzbMDUgMUShxdPHDl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ebenhaeser Els (Ben)","credit_id":"52fe4bac9251416c910e2153","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederik Burgers","original_name":"Frederik Burgers","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Fanie Lotz","credit_id":"52fe4bac9251416c910e2157","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162798,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pierre de Wet","original_name":"Pierre de Wet","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mr. Marais","credit_id":"52fe4bac9251416c910e215b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanlie van Niekerk","original_name":"Hanlie van Niekerk","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Rita Botha","credit_id":"52fe4bac9251416c910e215f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hendrik Susan","original_name":"Hendrik Susan","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4bac9251416c910e2163","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Havenga","original_name":"Ben Havenga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Sandman","credit_id":"52fe4bac9251416c910e2167","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wanda Lemmer","original_name":"Wanda Lemmer","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4bac9251416c910e216f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bettie Groenewald","original_name":"Bettie Groenewald","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4bac9251416c910e2173","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dulcie van der Merwe","original_name":"Dulcie van der Merwe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4bac9251416c910e2177","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desmond Willson","original_name":"Desmond Willson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4bac9251416c910e217b","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Hesse","original_name":"Vincent Hesse","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4bac9251416c910e217f","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1071375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pieter Hauptfleisch","original_name":"Pieter Hauptfleisch","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Mr. Botha","credit_id":"52fe4bac9251416c910e2183","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162798,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pierre de Wet","original_name":"Pierre de Wet","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54b585a0c3a3680dda000351","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162798,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pierre de Wet","original_name":"Pierre de Wet","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54b585c7925141747200969a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0437063","wikidata_id":"Q13034231","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":904,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xu5yTQyQO7mRlzp4LJqZ4mtzbu3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":409,"name":"africa"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
