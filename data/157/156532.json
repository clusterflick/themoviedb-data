We watch an uncle mow, farm hands haying with the White Mountains in the background, various young children playing, a lad holding his cat while carrying milk cans on a yoke, a pointer stalking a cat, the annual burning of brush and rubbish, and a montage of chores and relaxation on the farm. The last shot is of spring, a flag in the background. The films are sweet and straightforward, with clear black and white images.","popularity":0.0437,"poster_path":"/51M9tuArddqguKR4n3IvNGLIlmu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Windy Ledge Farm","video":false,"vote_average":6.75,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1147433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth Woodman Wright","original_name":"Elizabeth Woodman Wright","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ba39251416c910e10ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0877372","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/51M9tuArddqguKR4n3IvNGLIlmu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1932-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
