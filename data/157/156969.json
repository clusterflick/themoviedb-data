Proving that no one, not even DEATH can separate us from the living. A story that conquers the old adage \"till death do us part\", Roman (Oyo Boy Sotto) dies in a car accident. In a restless and unforgiving state he continues to prove his affection for girlfriend Joyce (Angel Locsin) . He then decides to embark in an intrepid and malevolent journey in order to keep Joyce. Joyce then began receiving hair raising text messages and even gets \"death photos\" of people close to her, including that of her current beau Alex (Dennis Trillo). She ignores these at first, but when the deaths happen under the exact circumstances at which they were predicted, she realizes she must fight the evil behind all these to protect her loved ones from this supernatural force.","popularity":0.2635,"poster_path":"/7dZvYg8PwjBFXAXZgDHHHU7qpO1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8355,"logo_path":null,"name":"APT Entertainment","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":8238,"logo_path":"/3f3SS3sep9V3Nf7RAxNd5UUEw1E.png","name":"Regal Entertainment","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2006-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TxT","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":460594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angel Locsin","original_name":"Angel Locsin","popularity":2.8482,"profile_path":"/3vfyrhOMbL04KY6mU2PrRIsgEOX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Joyse","credit_id":"52fe4bae9251416c910e2565","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Trillo","original_name":"Dennis Trillo","popularity":0.7785,"profile_path":"/FbgdAhqE9JjhLzsZkip1pAEzv5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alex","credit_id":"52fe4bae9251416c910e2569","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oyo Boy Sotto","original_name":"Oyo Boy Sotto","popularity":0.3274,"profile_path":"/pTxsx2ZMKoj8II3IrvEVkoHk7Ku.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Roman","credit_id":"52fe4bae9251416c910e256d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1094830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Clarete","original_name":"Julia Clarete","popularity":0.1293,"profile_path":"/4sY53vrzJ9OONHs8AjlGoWKXAbh.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ida","credit_id":"52fe4bae9251416c910e2571","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":227119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dante Rivero","original_name":"Dante Rivero","popularity":0.1667,"profile_path":"/vq4q2RXpdtnxuasNXRB8zOycMik.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dante","credit_id":"52fe4bae9251416c910e2575","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Domingo","original_name":"Eugene Domingo","popularity":0.5709,"profile_path":"/uYMbQAkuswthnm1Xihvg9zrhpvc.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Aling Kuring","credit_id":"55a217bd9251412977002dcf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bing Loyzaga","original_name":"Bing Loyzaga","popularity":0.2462,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Edith","credit_id":"55a217c99251412979002b12","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":262129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Perla Bautista","original_name":"Perla Bautista","popularity":0.4246,"profile_path":"/5yksMeQ0jjWlWgJNmZwFb2xZh8q.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Lola Lilia","credit_id":"55a217dec3a3681cec002a6f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1230950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan K.","original_name":"Allan K.","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Quiapo Seller 1","credit_id":"55a217ee9251412971002deb","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1373999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malou Crisologo","original_name":"Malou Crisologo","popularity":0.1032,"profile_path":"/qiJQn0w0FIXNB1xXOcDK8jDnUiC.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Hospice Administrator","credit_id":"55a2181a9251412974002e07","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Tuviera","original_name":"Michael Tuviera","popularity":0.0992,"profile_path":"/hyhDt7PKS0E1fHia0UP6VrNlUTA.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bae9251416c910e257b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199997,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Daza","original_name":"Paul Daza","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55a2176ac3a3681cec002a5f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1205945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Tuviera","original_name":"Michael Tuviera","popularity":0.0992,"profile_path":"/hyhDt7PKS0E1fHia0UP6VrNlUTA.jpg","credit_id":"55a21778c3a3681cf3002ec3","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0877721","wikidata_id":"Q7859550","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7dZvYg8PwjBFXAXZgDHHHU7qpO1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
