That's enough for them. Now they're off to bag themselves a moose, a bear, a fox, a lion, a leopard. It doesn't much matter as long as a fur coat will bag Betty. But neither of them are especially competent at the sport. Koko has to put up with a moose that fires back; while Bimbo suffers the wrath of a lion who multiplies after being shot. And neither hunter accounts for Betty's fickleness or her kind heart.","popularity":0.5812,"poster_path":"/kqUagu57acLPzjnpeLF4CCGA9EJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fleischer Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Hunting We Will Go","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Trumna pod sufitem","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A-Hunting We Will Go","type":"alternative spelling"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Caccia grossa","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1121496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Little","original_name":"Ann Little","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/3hhDoxLfyLkz3k1hVfhvGtTYsZv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Betty Boop","credit_id":"54d60d59c3a3683b89001e16","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Fleischer","original_name":"Dave Fleischer","popularity":0.3152,"profile_path":"/wSsZ2FuFstd6Ed0D6h94TwYlVuq.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ba29251416c910e0e4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0022604","wikidata_id":"Q28437741","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2ZMpDrmOjqXX2WRQK4K4UMCDkY8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9r8L2iixALKGcokQ9NIBpmNH7vH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":1545,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kqUagu57acLPzjnpeLF4CCGA9EJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5154,"name":"fur"},{"id":14814,"name":"fur coat"},{"id":33688,"name":"hunting"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1932-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
