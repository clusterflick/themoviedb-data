The slightest identity check carries within it the germs of a possible skid, rebellion or blunder. A case is emblematic of this impasse. For the first time in France, teenagers filed a complaint collectively for intentional violence against a police brigade of the 12th arrondissement of Paris. During this trial, it is the very mission of the police that will be indicted. Citizens, educators, lawyers or police officers, look for a way out and denounce the systematic use of violence that they consider illegitimate. By following their fight, this film lifts the veil on the mechanisms of this violence and the silences that surround it.","popularity":0.0964,"poster_path":"/avkGqxxAjy8AFtUoDGXfFDqvd8s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97782,"logo_path":"/xPgTSHpGRJR2JCyMDvlE7XehTRw.png","name":"Talweg Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Police, illégitime violence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2555867,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Marc Ball","original_name":"Marc Ball","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee1fa29f36a32001d938bbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2555867,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Marc Ball","original_name":"Marc Ball","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fe6fb8aacf7cfb2699bc19","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5374310,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Song Pham","original_name":"Song Pham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fe6fc3c1e0a708cbad68f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/avkGqxxAjy8AFtUoDGXfFDqvd8s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"francais\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"français\"}","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
