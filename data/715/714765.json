It's intention is to be a catalyst to thought and reflection about the lives and struggles of people from that community whose stories still go untold.  It is the fictional account of a family. We listen to the stories of three generations of women and their friend Julius on the day their community is to be destroyed by the municipal government of Halifax.  This story is a portrait of four individuals coping with universal uncertainties and insecurities.","popularity":0.0802,"poster_path":"/h2UBXWo4pOLmd9bmhcjCWxvBEvJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welcome to Africville","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1962532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Chapman","original_name":"Alexander Chapman","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61dfc641e24b93004174e4db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3380793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathy Imre","original_name":"Kathy Imre","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61dfc65dc525c400423dc3a1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Strawn","original_name":"Amanda Strawn","popularity":0.1555,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"61dfc672e24b93008d4d7b3a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3380795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nunya Beckley","original_name":"Nunya Beckley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61dfc6808cfcc7001cfc6c7a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3380797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Smith","original_name":"Karen Smith","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61dfc7090b5fd6001db6b439","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":554471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meshell Ndegeocello","original_name":"Meshell Ndegeocello","popularity":0.1523,"profile_path":"/A8q62h2gmHNIVGnZh4Unv2TIHRo.jpg","credit_id":"61dfc6b1676ce20068c14f05","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2505052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dana Inkster","original_name":"Dana Inkster","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/a3UMlTzoatsIbgy1Cb1ROo1bqtL.jpg","credit_id":"5ee2cb75197de400228f9c2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h2UBXWo4pOLmd9bmhcjCWxvBEvJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1060}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
