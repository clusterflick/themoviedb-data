Inspired by early performances of the work, which were staged in theatres and concert halls rather than churches, including its first performance at Bristol Old Vic in 1782, it is a rare treat for connoisseurs and enthusiasts alike.","popularity":0.0946,"poster_path":"/gCJ5yAB0Ff2DPXqLWTQzpJtIzeX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42148,"logo_path":"/7bVderKf6ebTLLZMp8no2Jrv70K.png","name":"Bristol Old
