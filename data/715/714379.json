Danger comes from poachers, who hunt for bear fur and bile, which is believed to heal. Danger comes from illegal hunting centers, enslaving baby animals for dog training. Yet a human becomes stronger not through a struggle or hunt — but… love. And care — for a bear. ‘’Land of Bears’’ is a film about the country, where love between a man and bear is mutual.","popularity":0.1073,"poster_path":"/cbYAQxTDEa4GERFrv2DxWfWd8qM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104460,"logo_path":"/iCTuwRWJYHmreIEAaYicHqEqEBN.png","name":"Format TV","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":212757,"logo_path":null,"name":"ООО «Док-Фильм»","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land of Bears","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Land of Bears","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1968689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Konstantin Veremejchik","original_name":"Konstantin Veremejchik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6546d4e8d8cc4a011dc3dc69","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1539923,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alexandra Ivanova","original_name":"Alexandra Ivanova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6546d4c3d8cc4a00e3cb8c39","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2887312,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pavel Sergeev","original_name":"Pavel Sergeev","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6546d4e26beaea00ac2038e5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2813969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irina Guryanova","original_name":"Ирина Гурьянова","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/sSwFKTEBitDL4tCdMhcEe78M6c.jpg","credit_id":"6546de116beaea012c8e4edc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1747246,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darya Khrenova","original_name":"Дарья Хренова","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/5Y7ceMWiH80aqoBJUG5nY5ovsnJ.jpg","credit_id":"5ee11462dbf144001e921e4a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1747246,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darya Khrenova","original_name":"Дарья Хренова","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/5Y7ceMWiH80aqoBJUG5nY5ovsnJ.jpg","credit_id":"5ee1145ec8113d00217a21df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2670504,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Natalya Bernyakova","original_name":"Natalya Bernyakova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee11474c8113d00217a2234","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2017188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oksana Barkovskaya","original_name":"Оксана Барковская","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/opKRFzINEVlVmq9oVBKUmgezOai.jpg","credit_id":"5ee1146af031740022ddccc9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":946,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3V1z5AYbAxg60rF8m4nD0iD2ffu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1681}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cbYAQxTDEa4GERFrv2DxWfWd8qM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Meridian of Hope All-Russian Ecological Competition Film Festival","release_date":"2019-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
