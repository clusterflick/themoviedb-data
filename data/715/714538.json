Sequestered behind the cramped counter, Pianelli films the world as it passes before her with a boundless sense of curiosity and compassion. iPhone or GoPro strategically set up before her, she records idiosyncratic interactions with charming regulars who drop by for their newspapers and a chat, or the lost passers-by simply looking for directions. Le Kiosque is a tender study of humanity, as well as a bittersweet sketch of physical media’s dying days as the newsstand’s future becomes increasingly unclear.","popularity":0.1013,"poster_path":"/50OzMXuGEuPc0cjFMDEJMJqA8xW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120889,"logo_path":"/eN1GoiNgJHueh6LBNMHJuxyYLn.png","name":"Les Films de l’œil
