After the end of the GDR, the school was threatened with extinction: the building was dilapidated, Berlin was broke, the search for a new location threatened to fail. The students themselves finally fought their way to the new location under the motto \"Bitte nach Mitte!\" (\"Letâ€™s move to the center\").","popularity":0.1107,"poster_path":"/pB9Jc8QjwytmQb8t1dz27vWi8NK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bitte nach Mitte!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Hoss","original_name":"Nina Hoss","popularity":0.8305,"profile_path":"/j4j3eenfrg0XgW0dVReFAdPNPE0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64276452a3e4ba00f233f86e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lars Eidinger","original_name":"Lars Eidinger","popularity":0.505,"profile_path":"/u2La8Q3FfaFsMAw3YvvmAtMT95Y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64276465a3e4ba011149ac6c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1108030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Osterloh","original_name":"Anne Osterloh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee2622f197de400228eddfe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12494912","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pB9Jc8QjwytmQb8t1dz27vWi8NK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":643}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
