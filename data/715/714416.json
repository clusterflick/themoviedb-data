It is so deeply ingrained that parents often pass down their love of guns to their children, and gun companies now market real rifles to kids as young as four - with blue ones for boys and pink for girls. This documentary sheds light on the world of young shooters, illuminating the beliefs, ambitions, and paranoia that motivate adults to put guns in the hands of children. Teaching kids to shoot is seen as a fun family experience and yet over 3000 children are injured or killed every year in accidental shootings. This documentary follows the stories of three American families tackling the difficult issues behind the American relationship with firearms and the compelling stories behind the horrifying statistics.","popularity":0.5059,"poster_path":"/lhW8hzxHAvnMZ7K2l1YPmc4Yw5L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35177,"logo_path":"/3QcZMjZRSqmaNkf0vFm49OhK6bA.png","name":"Minnow Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kids and Guns","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"USA:s bev√§pnade barn","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francine Shaw","original_name":"Francine Shaw","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee12c9290dde00022a73852","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francine Shaw","original_name":"Francine Shaw","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee12c99f36a32001e8d44b1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674105,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Barclay","original_name":"Steve Barclay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee12caa4c1bb00020a2fecd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674107,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sean Lewis","original_name":"Sean Lewis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee12cda90dde00022a7387b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674108,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Steve Prior","original_name":"Steve Prior","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee12cebc8113d001f79b2f6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3997224","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lhW8hzxHAvnMZ7K2l1YPmc4Yw5L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":226424,"name":"gun control"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
