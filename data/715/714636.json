Thirty-two years earlier, in that same place, a battalion of Argentine soldiers was defending themselves from the British invasion on June 11, 1982. In the voice of Carlos Giordano, the present and the past intersect in a story that seeks to denounce the usurpation of the United Kingdom and the actions of the Argentine armed forces. Through animations, archival images and fictionalizations, this film recreates that night of camping captured in the digital book ViajeMalvinos.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/6dJm7F3m1KcihqRc02v3cwGNHbT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135555,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumbre Estudio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2020-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La noche de las guerras","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Giordano","original_name":"Carlos Giordano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ee23aa290dde00021aab939","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2430210,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gabriel Mallea","original_name":"Gabriel Mallea","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/qVyupxhfxJeGSUnprfi9BaG0BGg.jpg","credit_id":"6519ce13967cc73424674c8a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2430210,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gabriel Mallea","original_name":"Gabriel Mallea","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/qVyupxhfxJeGSUnprfi9BaG0BGg.jpg","credit_id":"6519ce1993bd6900c4df79bb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475229,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Camilo Giordano","original_name":"Camilo Giordano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee23a5cf36a32001d9410b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674863,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Juan Protto","original_name":"Juan Protto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee23d3c59008600224e6118","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674865,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Camila Tellería","original_name":"Camila Tellería","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee23d7697eab40020e1a324","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674867,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Emiliano Rimoldi","original_name":"Emiliano Rimoldi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee23d8d97eab40020e1a34c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lara Sade","original_name":"Lara Sade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee23db859008600214eaa1d","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475229,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Camilo Giordano","original_name":"Camilo Giordano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee23ddcf36a32001e8f1f28","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674869,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Joaquín Kierbel","original_name":"Joaquín Kierbel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee23e2d197de4001f8ea97d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12496190","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6dJm7F3m1KcihqRc02v3cwGNHbT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"La noche de las guerras","key":"ziAZwMUY-Jk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-06-12T01:00:10.000Z","id":"5ee38c354e6742001f53442d"}]}}}
