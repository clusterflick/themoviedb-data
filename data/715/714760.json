They are Canada's unsung heroes in the fight for Black civil rights. Focusing on the 1930s to the 1950s, this film documents the struggle of 6 people who refused to accept inequality. Featured here, among others, are Viola Desmond, a woman who insisted on keeping her seat at the Roseland movie theatre in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia in 1946 rather than moving to the section normally reserved for the city's Black population, and Fred Christie, who took his case to the Supreme Court after being denied service at a Montreal tavern in 1936. These brave pioneers helped secure justice for all Canadians. Their stories deserve to be told.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/jd9p8uRHkY19wgmey47pGxafvPz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journey to Justice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2613787,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger McTair","original_name":"Roger McTair","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee2c31f90dde00022a8f75f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934232,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laine Drewery","original_name":"Laine Drewery","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee2c31897eab4001ee1c16c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2613787,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger McTair","original_name":"Roger McTair","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee2c2fb59008600224ed417","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2675382,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alan Mendelson","original_name":"Alan Mendelson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee2c327197de4001f8f3eac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0309742","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":827,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jd9p8uRHkY19wgmey47pGxafvPz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":551}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
