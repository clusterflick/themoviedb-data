In this short period of time, each of them witnesses something which makes them think about themselves. The young Willem accidently witnesses a couple making love in the bushes and doesn't know how to deal with this. Roos, a real 'tomboy', starts thinking about who she wants to be, after another girl confuses her for being a boy. Kees, a divorced man, thinks he has a flirt with a younger woman. When he finds out she wasn't flirting at all, he realizes that he has entered a new period of his life where he has to find his place. The three characters separately all experience a small tilt in their lives.","popularity":0.1446,"poster_path":"/4ep1jKONHgiQFGbqgwls5XNslBu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54890,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nederlandse
