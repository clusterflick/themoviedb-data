By offering successful embryo fertilization through digital chip technology, STORK advertises that they can remove potential disease and negative personality traits from the embryo's genetic code for $5000 per item. Too good to be true? A con game? Well, a chip-like micro-fluidic device does exist ( developed in Tokyo) that increases the probability of successful in-vitro fertilization from 29% (eggs in a petri dish...) up to 88%. And genetic engineers are close to identifying the codes for various diseases. But after hearing the couples (and doctor's) real-life stories, it's sad to think that many delightful human peculiarities might disappear, when perfect people walk the earth.","popularity":0.0606,"poster_path":"/vIc1neAQGglnBthHAA2RgPQiIQj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
