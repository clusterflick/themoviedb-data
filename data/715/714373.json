These 388 resistors – mostly young and inexperienced – almost haplessly ended up supporting the Allies in North Africa. In the process they paved the way for a successful invasion of Algiers by the U.S., but also helped to save the lives of over 500,000 Jews in North Africa, targeted by Hitler's Final Solution. This was all part of \"Operation Torch\", the joint American/U.K. mission that was to be the Allies’ first successful strike against the Nazis. This largely forgotten military operation remains to this day as the longest invasion in the history of conflict.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/79j1XCr92r5e2lUkWUl5FyvUDqe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Jewish Algerian Resistance of WWII","title":"Shadows of Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1162682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aline Robichaud","original_name":"Aline Robichaud","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee110c32dda890022763fc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2673977,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amos Carlen","original_name":"Amos Carlen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee110a9f031740021de128f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11438326","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/79j1XCr92r5e2lUkWUl5FyvUDqe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
