Building upon the analysis put forward in our 2018 documentary, History is Marching, and our 2019 short film, An Atlantic Tide, it covers the US-China trade war, the \"phase one\" US-China deal, Hong Kong, the politicisation of the coronavirus, conflicts between the EU imperialist bloc and the US, Brexit, the resurgence of a Turkish colonialism, the US dollar and oil, and the US' push toward drastic escalation in the Middle-East.  They are in free fall. We are the solution.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/c6QEXIcoZveBbx9KIunyrTraOvW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything Under Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2480743,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Bell","original_name":"James Bell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ee37d70197de40022912194","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2480745,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alex Bushell","original_name":"Alex Bushell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee37d8a5b4fed001f61bca2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2480743,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Bell","original_name":"James Bell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee37d7f97eab4001ee304be","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2642158,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Prolekult","original_name":"Prolekult","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee37f0d197de40022912374","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c6QEXIcoZveBbx9KIunyrTraOvW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
