In an attempt to pull his movie back on track he employs drastic measures; trying out impossible dialogue on a pizza delivery man, wandering around the neighborhood to scare up new characters and scenes, hoping for inspiration from every pretty girl that passes his way. In the end he realizes that the creation of art, for him, isn't fictional at all, but merely a collage of real-life moments in which he finds meaning and delight. Produced as part of Rick Schmidt Workshop.","popularity":0.0939,"poster_path":"/ux4R5EOTaFGzBew4qB8dUMKEuRZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crash My Funeral","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2675113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mandeep Khera","original_name":"Mandeep Khera","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee276904c1bb0001ea5ca4a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2675116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meeka Schmalle","original_name":"Meeka Schmalle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Pretty Girl","credit_id":"5ee27695d8d3290022e14795","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1708385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yahn Soon","original_name":"Yahn Soon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Script Writer","credit_id":"5ee2769cd8d3290021e14825","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Schmidt","original_name":"Rick Schmidt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/daOMD2Kbjtjhxwglz0QJcfpP9XU.jpg","credit_id":"5ee2766ad8d3290023e145bd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2675113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mandeep Khera","original_name":"Mandeep Khera","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee2767c97eab4001ee1694b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2675113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mandeep Khera","original_name":"Mandeep Khera","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee2768659008600214f00a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1990502,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Morgan Schmidt-Feng","original_name":"Morgan Schmidt-Feng","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/52wyeVXDnMLMMZCZE7zRYLAszOk.jpg","credit_id":"5ee276adf36a32001d9469d4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rick Schmidt","original_name":"Rick Schmidt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/daOMD2Kbjtjhxwglz0QJcfpP9XU.jpg","credit_id":"5ee2766590dde0001fa7f71a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1990502,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Morgan Schmidt-Feng","original_name":"Morgan Schmidt-Feng","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/52wyeVXDnMLMMZCZE7zRYLAszOk.jpg","credit_id":"5ee2767090dde00020a9ef68","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3868626","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ux4R5EOTaFGzBew4qB8dUMKEuRZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":696}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
