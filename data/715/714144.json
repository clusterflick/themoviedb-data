The director (loveable Bob Cresse) appears to be bored by her demonstration of acting and cuts to the nitty gritty. The actress is unabashed and procedes to do a striptease. As she completes her \"act\" the door opens to admit... the REAL casting director! The bogus director fumbles with his fancy cravat, removing it and begins to use it as a duster... exit the office cleaner, stage left.","popularity":0.2014,"poster_path":"/l6nc9fuqHnT7fdcZFi1jzHP3O7w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Casting Director","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101448,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bob Cresse","original_name":"Bob Cresse","popularity":0.0744,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Casting Director","credit_id":"5ee021d8f36a32001f8e2582","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":99934,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David F.
