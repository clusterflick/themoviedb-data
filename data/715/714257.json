Bjernér, who reported from 23 wars in 83 countries, had his lungs injured for life in the poison gas disaster in Bhopal, India in 1984. The film begins with him almost dying several times, but miraculously returning to life. In interviews and archival photos, he shares his unique first-hand experiences of war, violence and corruption. A glowing agitation to never stop demanding responsibility for the world's tragedies.","popularity":0.236,"poster_path":"/pN7b5euMQoImjPrlvHPU4te0Veb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124726,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produktionsgruppen Wechselmann AB","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2014-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vittne till sin samtid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Evidence","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2673399,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Claes Göran Bjernér","original_name":"Claes Göran Bjernér","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ee0ad862dda89002175f9c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2673404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamiko Bjernér","original_name":"Tamiko Bjernér","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5ee0ad9290dde00021a78efd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1512919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herman Lindqvist","original_name":"Herman Lindqvist","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/47lSnyw0ARadKxeJbKFbe5Pgr1V.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ee0ad9ef36a32001d90da61","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2093477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maj Wechselmann","original_name":"Maj Wechselmann","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/vMpacTfJMviQ1QCWzmUZsSQulRC.jpg","credit_id":"5ee0ad1fc8113d00217993fa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2093477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maj Wechselmann","original_name":"Maj Wechselmann","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/vMpacTfJMviQ1QCWzmUZsSQulRC.jpg","credit_id":"5ee0ad76f36a32001e8c96a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andi Loor","original_name":"Andi Loor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee0ad4a2dda89002275db36","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2673399,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Claes Göran Bjernér","original_name":"Claes Göran Bjernér","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee0ad5df031740020dd387b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2093477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maj Wechselmann","original_name":"Maj Wechselmann","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/vMpacTfJMviQ1QCWzmUZsSQulRC.jpg","credit_id":"5ee0ad2d2dda89001f75e2c2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2093477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maj Wechselmann","original_name":"Maj Wechselmann","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/vMpacTfJMviQ1QCWzmUZsSQulRC.jpg","credit_id":"5ee0ad3b90dde00021a78e98","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2093477,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maj Wechselmann","original_name":"Maj Wechselmann","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/vMpacTfJMviQ1QCWzmUZsSQulRC.jpg","credit_id":"5ee0ad1390dde00021a78e89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3726194","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pN7b5euMQoImjPrlvHPU4te0Veb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":917,"name":"journalism"},{"id":181324,"name":"existentialism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Swedish\", \"english_name\"=>\"Swedish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"sv\", \"native_name\"=>\"Swedish\"}","note":"Festival viewing","release_date":"2014-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
