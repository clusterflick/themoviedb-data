Over three fever-dream nights in the Hotel Biron, poet Rainer Maria Rilke encounters the ghost of his good friend, artist Paula Modersohn-Becker, who died shortly after giving birth to her first child. In response to this haunting, Rilke writes his epic prose lament, \"Requiem for a Friend\", as a tribute to Paula and to women torn between choosing a life sacrificed to Art or to Motherhood. One hundred years later, three women - a painter, an actress and a dancer - and a theatre director prepare to stage Rilke's \"Requiem\" in Berkeley California as abstract performance ritual.","popularity":0.0578,"poster_path":"/ydYqUjpkgLwZt6UfoH3oZoMrCkm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135403,"logo_path":null,"name":"ParaTheatrical
