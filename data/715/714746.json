In his free time, Henry roams Greenwich Village with his girl friend Sandy and roommate Solly. One day, Henry convinces Sandy that she should move in with him and Solly. When the time comes for Sandy to move in her belongings, however, Henry is unavailable to help her because he is having sex with his co-worker Rhoda. As Sandy and Solly drift into an affair, Henry tries to convince Rhoda that he does not love her. Soon after, Martin Axborough, his boss at the collection agency, tries to instill some initiative in Henry, a professed anti-materialist, by letting him make some collections over the telephone. Through his phone contacts, Henry discovers that Axborough has been swindling his clients, prompting Henry to become even more alienated and disillusioned.","popularity":0.6829,"poster_path":"/kMPO5WlDlrzd4r9ArPWTyWhUnyn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's a strange kind of comedy.","title":"March of the Spring Hare","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Roommates","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Garfield","original_name":"Allen Garfield","popularity":0.5104,"profile_path":"/v4S64Kcmgg7THvrFElzAeJiscy6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Martin Axborough","credit_id":"5ee2b45a197de400228f636a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4999232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Mason","original_name":"Dan Mason","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Henry","credit_id":"670c9f751ca4c39fdeeb72da","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":157444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Brock","original_name":"Stanley Brock","popularity":0.4642,"profile_path":"/juKmPM9EAxDY1J55kbgdw0uuw17.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Madison","credit_id":"670c9f8d4df59a608c637c85","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3358169,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harvey Marks","original_name":"Harvey Marks","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Solly","credit_id":"670c9fa11ca4c39fdeeb72f0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":128379,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bruce G.
