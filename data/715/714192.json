It is inherently site specific, but wide angel lens on the iPhone prevents the photographer from documenting the work in its entirety. The commercialization of graffiti focuses only on the surface where the graffiti is painted and leaves out the context of how to artist got there, how dangerous it was, and the amount of time they were able to spend with the work before the risk of being arrested was too high. This film aims to show the viewer an intimate look at the process and the performance that is often out of the conversation.  Up Here Kids gives an intimate look into Tennessee's graffiti culture through beautiful cinematography, interviews and storytelling. It focuses on the process and what motivates a handful of the notorious artists in the scene.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/1LM84MD9xzGNII9WqIX2EMUMyH1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up Here Kids","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3817400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Doty","original_name":"Erik Doty","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"638ebc0666a0d300c0824054","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1LM84MD9xzGNII9WqIX2EMUMyH1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2815,"name":"graffiti"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
