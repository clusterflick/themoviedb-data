Produced surreptitiously in Hollywood in 1934-5, the film dramatizes the plight of millions of unemployed workers amidst the Depression. This message is filtered through the story of a single “forgotten man” who walks the streets in desperate search of a job. Driven by hunger, he contemplates becoming a scab. A union man intervenes, coaching him to recognize common interests with his brethren. He is ultimately converted to the cause of trade unionism.","popularity":0.0967,"poster_path":"/iBXUiHYX9CcOT8OZnUyZEhJ0eS8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135425,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Labor Films, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Millions of Us","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2673204,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gail West","original_name":"Gail West","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee06611dbf144001d8fe39a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2673206,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"George Buck","original_name":"George Buck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee0662890dde0001fa64e27","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Slavko Vorkapich","original_name":"Slavko Vorkapich","popularity":0.109,"profile_path":"/6Y6Is9P5A1vLIUFss5zWc8EAxLo.jpg","credit_id":"5ee065bef36a32001e8c2b2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2673203,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Taylor","original_name":"Tina Taylor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee06602f36a32001d904945","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2334230","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iBXUiHYX9CcOT8OZnUyZEhJ0eS8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
