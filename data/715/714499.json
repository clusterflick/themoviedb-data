When a tragic accident befalls the pitiless Blake resulting in his untimely (but maybe deserved?) demise, Jessica seizes the opportunity to make the sale on her own by hiding Blake's body. It’s the perfect crime with one small problem, Jessica’s phone won’t stop ringing. Even worse, it’s Blake. Suspenseful hilarity ensues as Jessica attempts to close the sale before anyone finds out, but secrets rarely go uncovered for long.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2674360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Elmore","original_name":"Charles Elmore","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee16f4cf36a32001f908753","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11340106","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"deadCenter Film Festival","release_date":"2020-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
