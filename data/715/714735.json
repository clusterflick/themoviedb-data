Scenes chronicling Howard’s doomed romance with Scandinavian girl friend Turid Aarsted are interwoven with scenes detailing Howard’s relationship with his parents and with a former girl friend, as well as his failed attempts at moviemaking. One sequence depicts Aarsted leaving the thirty-seven-year-old Howard for the film’s cameraman, Paul Goldsmith, and includes a sex scene between the new lovers. In off-screen commentary, producer Kenneth E. Schwartz expresses concern about the film’s content. He reveals that he raised $50,000 for the project, complains to the viewer that the film was not supposed to be a “diary of freaky people.” Eventually he and Howard come to terms about the film’s direction and allow the film’s story to unfold unobstructed.","popularity":0.0441,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snapshots","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1435051,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mel Howard","original_name":"Mel Howard","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee2ab9cf36a32001f92c95f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65610,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Goldsmith","original_name":"Paul Goldsmith","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64550350091e6200e4ce2a5b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2675321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irving Horowitz","original_name":"Irving Horowitz","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee2ade697eab40020e23b3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1435051,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mel Howard","original_name":"Mel Howard","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee2adda5b4fed0021612d5a","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2675332,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kenneth E.
