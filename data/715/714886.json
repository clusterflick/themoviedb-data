But his Roma tower block at the outskirts of a provincial town in Bulgaria is no place for romance. 25 years ago it had all it takes for panel socialist heaven: from parquet floors to intercom, the coveted hot water central, street lamps, benches under murmuring apple trees. Someone called the place Paradise Hotel - and the name stuck. But with the years the block gradually changed. The parquet disappeared. The water stopped. The lights went off. But each of the 1 500 inhabitants has a plan how to get back the dream of Paradise Lost. And if you cross the field behind Paradise Hotel where heaven and earth meet, you will see Bozhidar \"The God Given\" who protects everyone from evil and excessive happiness in a documentary about panel integration, love, misery, a lot of dreams, a little lyrics and one Gypsy wedding.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":"/tbLcCdvHgJzDR0gb56MxEvlnTQ1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15608,"logo_path":"/qBRUElUQABd4zOqTKYPi1A2nQdQ.png","name":"Agitprop","origin_country":"BG"},{"id":27289,"logo_path":null,"name":"HBO Bulgaria","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"2010-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","title":"Hotel Rai","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2675881,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophia Tzavella","original_name":"Sophia Tzavella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee36fc84e6742001f531805","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2675881,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophia Tzavella","original_name":"Sophia Tzavella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee36fd0590086002150fe04","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3615116","wikidata_id":"Q27115818","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tbLcCdvHgJzDR0gb56MxEvlnTQ1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Bulgarian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Bulgarian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"bg\", \"native_name\"=>\"Bulgarian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2010-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
