Delivering their own message on the air, the group promotes peace and ecological awareness while decrying war and consumerism. After one group member divulges their location to authorities, federal agents arrest Freemont, send him to trial and convict him. The group subsequently frees Freemont from a detention center, then continues their broadcasts, while Freemont rides his horse alone along a bridle path.","popularity":0.3095,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Please Stand By","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2675352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Peel","original_name":"David Peel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Freemont Zapata","credit_id":"5ee2b22e97eab4001fe12ab4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2675353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wendy Appel","original_name":"Wendy Appel","popularity":0.0506,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5ee2b24497eab40020e24231","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberts Blossom","original_name":"Roberts Blossom","popularity":0.5397,"profile_path":"/CP19Dvjvx2xSrkyJQEdmAC4wug.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Judge Nott","credit_id":"5ee2b26a197de4001f8f27fa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5139067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.J.
