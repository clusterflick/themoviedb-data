It's also a sometimes humorous, sometimes heartrending portrayal of his family's changing perceptions of the process of death. It follows the final day in the life of an elderly patriarch who has lapsed into an intermittent coma. As he dies, his son returns home to visit the family, where he unexpectedly participates in an ancient ritual of ancestral origins.","popularity":0.1004,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":135403,"logo_path":null,"name":"ParaTheatrical ReSearch","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Oracle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2672768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Art Janette","original_name":"Art Janette","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5edfeebb0e597b001e488cf2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2672771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathryn Rice","original_name":"Kathryn Rice","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5edfef7adbf144001e9005b0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2672777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marzee Crum","original_name":"Marzee Crum","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5edfeff690dde00022a5fb02","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2672766,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Camille Hildebrandt","original_name":"Camille Hildebrandt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5edfefff9c24fc00226cd9e2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1749988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel Gilman","original_name":"Joel Gilman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5edff00aaad9c200222aab15","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2672780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Shaw","original_name":"Amanda Shaw","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5edff01fc8113d002178763d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antero Alli","original_name":"Antero Alli","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5edfedf8b4224200209743aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antero Alli","original_name":"Antero Alli","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5edfee0090dde00021a6032a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antero Alli","original_name":"Antero Alli","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5edfee07dbf144001e9004a8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antero Alli","original_name":"Antero Alli","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5edfee0eb4224200209743c4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2672766,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Camille Hildebrandt","original_name":"Camille Hildebrandt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5edfee47aad9c2002029b0a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087597,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pablo Neruda","original_name":"Pablo Neruda","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":"/2vEGWfXhk2EWNNDedmoM0rF4WyP.jpg","credit_id":"5edfee569c24fc00226cd6a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2462656,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sylvi Alli","original_name":"Sylvi Alli","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5edff029dbf144001e900693","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0107753","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
