During their active period 1978-86 they played in every single hole and sold lots of records, yet it was silent about them in the media. Although it's been twenty years since they stopped playing, they have always been discovered by new fans. In 2003, Asta Kask picks up the instruments again - not to be reunited but to take revenge on everyone who has been deceiving them over the years. The Gothenburg films Erik Kolthoff and Staffan Danielsson have followed the band during their revenge tour. Interviews about Asta Kask and the punk movement are mixed with old and new live material.","popularity":0.0717,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dom får aldrig mig - En film om Asta Kask och punken","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640854,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Staffan Danielsson","original_name":"Staffan Danielsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebfddd28e2e000021182719","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Kolthoff","original_name":"Erik Kolthoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebfde113d3557001ee2b002","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640854,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Staffan Danielsson","original_name":"Staffan Danielsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebfdddb6d675a00217e7b98","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640854,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Staffan Danielsson","original_name":"Staffan Danielsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebfddcb9979d200202b72d2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640854,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Staffan Danielsson","original_name":"Staffan Danielsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebfdde228723c0020446778","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Kolthoff","original_name":"Erik Kolthoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebfde179979d200202b731b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2640856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Kolthoff","original_name":"Erik Kolthoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebfde06d2147c0023b1ede1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0910867","wikidata_id":"Q10475748","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4470,"name":"punk rock"},{"id":266318,"name":"asta kask"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
