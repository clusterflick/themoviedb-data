As a counter-movement of the attitudes and practices of today's culture, one in six girls in the US has vowed to remain 'unsoiled' until marriage. But the seven children of the Wilson family, founders of the Purity Ball, take this concept of purity of body and mind one step further; even their first kiss will be at the altar. For two years, the filmmakers follow the Wilson offspring as they prepare for their fairytale vision of romance and marriage and seek out their own prince and princess spouses. In the process, a broader theme emerges: how the religious right is grooming a young generation of virgins to embody an Evangelically-grounded Utopia in America.","popularity":0.3317,"poster_path":"/qfrC0luM8wUEWqtDNAlDEoVnxfP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Virgin Tales","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Virgin Tales - Jungfrauen-Märchen","type":"TV"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":53747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mirjam von Arx","original_name":"Mirjam von Arx","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b6d9251416c910da0e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1659889,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tammy Douglas","original_name":"Tammy Douglas","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b593f3c9251414d0e004daf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1732823,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Judy Karp","original_name":"Judy Karp","popularity":0.0685,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b593f31c3a36801df004904","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117841,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kirsten Johnson","original_name":"Kirsten Johnson","popularity":0.3191,"profile_path":"/9h1DYSYLnPujVBtM4mklFDnZByj.jpg","credit_id":"5cfcf43f0e0a265ef8cdde38","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1144397,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Claudia Raschke","original_name":"Claudia Raschke","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cfcf434c3a368193321b69c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2076984","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1302,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qfrC0luM8wUEWqtDNAlDEoVnxfP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":916}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
