In addition to its sheer emotional punch, Music by Prudence has become the cornerstone of an advocacy campaign and has been embraced by the UN, Human Rights Watch and the disability community as an unprecedented portrayal advocating for the rights of persons with disabilities.  Prudences poignant, inspiring and irreverent message of hope has received an amazing response from press and audiences all across North America, and has won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short and several other awards as it continues drawing in more audiences.","popularity":0.2497,"poster_path":"/6KZBzfzg4Eidm1DImjHqhPS3eSl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZW","name":"Zimbabwe"}],"release_date":"2010-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music by Prudence","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Muzyka Prudence","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Музыка Пруденс","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Szívből jövő zene","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farai Mabhande","original_name":"Farai Mabhande","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5aca6954925141434100065c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prudence Mabhena","original_name":"Prudence Mabhena","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5aca696c0e0a2631f70006a8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2018938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Energy Maburutse","original_name":"Energy Maburutse","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5aca6982925141430300068e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1140442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Ross Williams","original_name":"Roger Ross Williams","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":"/tYKbOfNbK4JPeAsiEAdm9jCsss3.jpg","credit_id":"6510886026dac1014e222c9e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1140442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Ross Williams","original_name":"Roger Ross Williams","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":"/tYKbOfNbK4JPeAsiEAdm9jCsss3.jpg","credit_id":"584ca8b3c3a3682acd005354","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1024219,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elinor Burkett","original_name":"Elinor Burkett","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"584ca93d9251411e350048a9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1913176,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Patrick Wright","original_name":"Patrick Wright","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f41f55c3a3681fc900999b","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1913176,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Patrick Wright","original_name":"Patrick Wright","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f420dac3a368201700969b","department":"Editing","job":"Associate Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1543539","wikidata_id":"Q1954917","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6KZBzfzg4Eidm1DImjHqhPS3eSl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":162735,"name":"disability"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"HBO Documentary Films: Music By Prudence Trailer (HBO)","key":"pMJKbqwA5VY","published_at":"2010-05-06T16:04:56.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"533ec6fbc3a3685448009c12"}]}}}
