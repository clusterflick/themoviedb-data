This is Belladonna-era 'Thrax, pre-Public Enemy collaboration, playing some kick-ass metal in front of legions of British fans, their goofy take on thrash in full swing and embodied by Mutant Ninja Turtles and hideous jam shorts and haircuts that they all surely regret. Originally released in 1991 on VHS, this was re-issued on DVD in 2008 and again as part of the Deluxe Edition of Among the Living in 2009.","popularity":0.1832,"poster_path":"/sQj2mYgcUbOuSC8MhReAOkeWZxu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anthrax: Oidivnikufesin 1987","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Oidivnikufesin (N.F.V.)","type":"Full"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":560151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joey Belladonna","original_name":"Joey Belladonna","popularity":0.2295,"profile_path":"/hL2iXvQKPT8U8qDbnXGzj8lxoFB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lead Singer","credit_id":"6408a17bd75bd600de37ccd0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Ian","original_name":"Scott Ian","popularity":0.1565,"profile_path":"/17EZYDZyp90zmcAFqvWa7Lp3KNl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rhythm Guitar","credit_id":"6408a18d9f51af009912b023","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Benante","original_name":"Charlie Benante","popularity":0.1171,"profile_path":"/rLbKOgIDuuqkMRVk9hjNTnJm9QK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Drummer","credit_id":"6408a19e03f0b6007db8ceae","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Spitz","original_name":"Dan Spitz","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":"/tV7mYXkHIDjBdKLs3Nn78byk8nv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lead Guitar","credit_id":"6408a1ee03f0b6007db8cec5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Bello","original_name":"Frank Bello","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":"/nGqD8VRHXiowQirZNrwSEyNOC6Y.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"6408a220d75bd600862ea4fe","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l9xXmz2H5F9ZQHr3dcIbK5ilUVu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1330,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sQj2mYgcUbOuSC8MhReAOkeWZxu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":886},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l1c8xemWl2SqC8qJC14e5fEp5Qt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":5540,"name":"heavy metal"},{"id":10874,"name":"thrash metal"},{"id":11634,"name":"live performance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
