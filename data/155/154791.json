Yasser Arafat was an incredibly controversial figure- labeled by some as a corrupt terrorist whilst idolized by others as a revolutionary hero. Regardless of people's own opinions, his importance as an international leader cannot be disputed. The film is built around revealing interviews with the people who knew Arafat best; his comrades, confidants, and even his adversaries. The filmmakers also gained exclusive access to Yasser Arafat's widow, Suha, who provides a frank and highly emotional insight into the life that Arafat lived and the sacrifices he made for the Palestinian cause.","popularity":0.2888,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Price of Kings: Yasser Arafat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helena Bonham Carter","original_name":"Helena Bonham Carter","popularity":2.4772,"profile_path":"/hJMbNSPJ2PCahsP3rNEU39C8GWU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"57078e28c3a3683122000f7c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1135816,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Symons","original_name":"Richard Symons","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b6d9251416c910da02b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1135817,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joanna Natasegara","original_name":"Joanna Natasegara","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b6d9251416c910da031","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2179243","wikidata_id":"Q7758146","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
