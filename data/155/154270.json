The town's rabbi dies, and a sub-plot develops in which Max's father (Aaron Schwartz) and grandfather (Jan Rubes)-both synagogue leaders-are saddled with a traditional Hassidic rabbi who sticks out like a sore thumb among the otherwise assimilated Jewish community.  To make matters more difficult, Max likes a Catholic girl (14 year old Fairuza Baulk in just her third film), whom he later competes with in a piano competition.  The quirky, fun-loving rabbi tries to help him with his problems, yet harbours a secret ambition of his own.\r Filmed in Winnipeg and rural Beausejour, Manitoba, Canada.","popularity":1.2412,"poster_path":"/rhQ2u3uawoIzjSCrXtR1Tip6ePa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Southgate Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1988-09-16","revenue":317,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When Max was born they cut off his ....
