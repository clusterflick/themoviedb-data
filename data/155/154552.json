Everything is going for her: she has a successful professional career, loves her family, has enough money for a comfortable life, and has plans for the future. After arriving to the country, a strange feeling takes hold of her. She starts feeling the presence of something that moves the treetops at night, makes the dogs howl, and wanders like the breath of a ghost across the infinite countryside. A stinging feeling that kills all her certainties. In the middle of the night Elisa wakes up. The moonlight shines on her face.","popularity":0.1991,"poster_path":"/oip1iTvBeJqgXserIljiGqZGPkU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1042,"logo_path":"/cv8uj3G9fhe7vifZB6yjTzqI45V.png","name":"Cinecittà Studios","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":88524,"logo_path":null,"name":"Skydancers","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2011-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Open","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","title":"El campo","type":"Drama"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":74909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolores Fonzi","original_name":"Dolores Fonzi","popularity":1.0184,"profile_path":"/4axi3Dz8zKK0b1kk54tPOeywb84.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Elisa","credit_id":"52fe4b649251416c910d8ee5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonardo Sbaraglia","original_name":"Leonardo Sbaraglia","popularity":0.439,"profile_path":"/jGYgJqNEWVvp92ZPre1PEKfci5H.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Santiago","credit_id":"52fe4b649251416c910d8ee9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1148662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pochi Ducasse","original_name":"Pochi Ducasse","popularity":0.1976,"profile_path":"/ut5VRKDkHBR2QKUyZBDfhdHDdjB.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"543bf15dc3a368199c005a0d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1373508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matilda Manzano","original_name":"Matilda Manzano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"543bf164c3a36819980055c1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4334253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Villegas","original_name":"Juan Villegas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"653599b742d83700c93f809c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1135408,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hernán Bélon","original_name":"Hernán Bélon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b649251416c910d8efb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1135406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hernán Belón","original_name":"Hernán Belón","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/imOW9sKTwqWReU8vIf6h66NnoYt.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b649251416c910d8eef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1135407,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Valeria Radivo","original_name":"Valeria Radivo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b649251416c910d8ef5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Cornás","original_name":"Walter Cornás","popularity":0.1125,"profile_path":"/1v1nhLQoHrmDQmYkchXQjh5V0gN.jpg","credit_id":"6543e8bd7719d700ff8c43e7","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2235653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Ramos","original_name":"Pablo Ramos","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660cbdc095ce2401316df18d","department":"Directing","job":"Script Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1611038","wikidata_id":"Q3415747","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fG8XpallrGKN3TIygMlRQip7ki9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oip1iTvBeJqgXserIljiGqZGPkU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":769},{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/99zIOFxs8XH49iNznIod4rueWts.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":757}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10596,"name":"argentina"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Mar del Plata Film Festival","release_date":"2011-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
