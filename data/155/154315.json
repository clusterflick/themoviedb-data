Recorded specially for BBC Four at TV Centre, it's a stripped-down, intimate performance, with no set and minimal lighting - a painfully raw, honest and deeply funny exploration of disconnection and loneliness.","popularity":0.374,"poster_path":"/zARBaztCjtngzG0s8qLmKO5EGKP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Simon Amstell: Numb - Live at the BBC","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1221053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Amstell","original_name":"Simon Amstell","popularity":0.2073,"profile_path":"/bwRxx5KA3yyxpdsh6VFphhxtlw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"53352c09c3a3682ab5004286","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Kirkby","original_name":"Tim Kirkby","popularity":0.1223,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5335240b925141098500153c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1221053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Amstell","original_name":"Simon Amstell","popularity":0.2073,"profile_path":"/bwRxx5KA3yyxpdsh6VFphhxtlw.jpg","credit_id":"53352bf5c3a3682ab5004283","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2825716","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Yc2OmxEbGa1vJSVeS9eI7dJzqH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zARBaztCjtngzG0s8qLmKO5EGKP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xs2ZkyJk7K2GAqSA6ObzAinSQfE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
