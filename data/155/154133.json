Filmmakers Kan Lume and Loo Zihan co-directed this pathos that dramatizes the selfishness of love and its tragic outcomes. Set in contemporary Singapore, Solos follows the endeavors of Boy, Man and Mother. Having been in a relationship with Man (Lim Yu Beng) for years, Boy (Loo Zihan) eventually grows up and wishes to quit the relationship. Conversely, Man still wants to be with Boy and for them to settle together. Meanwhile, Mother (Goh Guat Kian) is devastated that her son (Boy) has abandoned her and has been in relationship with Man. As the three characters fight their own demons, Solos juxtaposes reality and surreal scenes in order to give clues of each characterâ€™s inner desires. The film has minimum conversation to give freedom to the audience's individual interpretation of the film.","popularity":0.1567,"poster_path":"/qPpwZdHoYQSKC4OBBXNpmwnyhZj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130942,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Dawn Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2007-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solos","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guat Kian Goh","original_name":"Guat Kian Goh","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"52fe4b569251416c910d7499","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lim Yu-Beng","original_name":"Lim Yu-Beng","popularity":0.2477,"profile_path":"/5jnqLlfNNhzWaYBz9EogMYW6mIG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Man","credit_id":"52fe4b569251416c910d749d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loo Zihan","original_name":"Loo Zihan","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/pxNhhZike7d93sfAxQFyFkYEpI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Boy","credit_id":"52fe4b569251416c910d74a1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4823762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peishan Chiew","original_name":"Peishan Chiew","popularity":0.054,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"668fa8b0bcb3c6eb6791397e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loo Zihan","original_name":"Loo Zihan","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/pxNhhZike7d93sfAxQFyFkYEpI.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b569251416c910d748f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kan Lume","original_name":"Kan Lume","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b569251416c910d7495","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loo Zihan","original_name":"Loo Zihan","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/pxNhhZike7d93sfAxQFyFkYEpI.jpg","credit_id":"668fa88af33a901d0bd52ea5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0995751","wikidata_id":"Q3489589","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rYRcVl6iiYUCz124lboiq9t5bZr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.69,"height":928,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qPpwZdHoYQSKC4OBBXNpmwnyhZj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Solos\" by Loo Zihan (trailer)","key":"9VXC-3LzRM4","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-06-29T12:50:46.000Z","id":"6540642975110d00e2d2b425"}]}}}
