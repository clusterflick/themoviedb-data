They arrive in Tulare just in time to rescue Matt from being hanged, but a guard is killed during their escape. Ed Larkin who framed Matt, falsely accuses them of a long list of crimes. They return to Fort Grant so that Tom can see his sweetheart Laura Brook. They encounter outlaw Bill Devlin who persuades them to hold up a train which Laura unwittingly told them would carry a large payroll. Soon the whole territory is enraged at their deeds. They return to Fort Grant to hold up the two banks that are filled with huge sums of cattle money.","popularity":0.7722,"poster_path":"/xOQTve0FDyUVmVWyvSnqi91yCiS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4946,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lippert Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5164,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sigmund Neufeld Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THERE WAS NO TURNING BACK...THIS WAS THEIR \"LAST RAID\"!","title":"Three Desperate Men","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Preston Foster","original_name":"Preston Foster","popularity":0.2813,"profile_path":"/fBxlhD0k4N8zAJX1FR4Uuf1MtUy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tom Denton","credit_id":"52fe4b549251416c910d70d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Davis","original_name":"Jim Davis","popularity":0.637,"profile_path":"/hyRy1u64pMK7nWTvHPtrBhTJ3iA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Fred Denton","credit_id":"52fe4b549251416c910d70db","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Grey","original_name":"Virginia Grey","popularity":0.4488,"profile_path":"/ftyCI3XPJoGS75m3DFXOgOpw58z.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Laura Brock","credit_id":"52fe4b549251416c910d70df","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Spalding","original_name":"Kim Spalding","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/qXmU924LbXLaZxG8FAvVGExFibv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Matt Denton","credit_id":"641c3f6b142ef100837f67fb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Haade","original_name":"William Haade","popularity":0.1914,"profile_path":"/tKcWdfVukKLoNd9q4RqeVFUJ6yL.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bill Devlin","credit_id":"641c3f7a142ef100d9bbbf32","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monte Blue","original_name":"Monte Blue","popularity":0.3353,"profile_path":"/f9VVvlkPviIaHfcW8fog8JwYUvP.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Marshal Pete Coleman","credit_id":"641c3f89d75bd624a5813751","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sid Melton","original_name":"Sid Melton","popularity":0.2307,"profile_path":"/zvrLwPm8eR3ABsu31R91MOc68IP.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Connors","credit_id":"641c3f9724b3330081ff6084","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rory Mallinson","original_name":"Rory Mallinson","popularity":0.1489,"profile_path":"/rUGV5zHGkCXTH66S5trWX0BlqCd.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Ed Larkin","credit_id":"641c3fa695c0af007cd0fcbf","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":105508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Seddon","original_name":"Margaret Seddon","popularity":0.1412,"profile_path":"/w7kN7GewHnIUm8ypxhMDrwsCs0M.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mrs. Denton","credit_id":"641c3fcda3e4ba00a1072056","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103355,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Orville H.
