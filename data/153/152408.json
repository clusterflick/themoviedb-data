For Alan, despite the effects of polio, there is only one passion in life - to become a great horseman just like his hero, the reclusive horse trainer East Driscoll (Russell Crowe). Alan is one of East's few friends and also one of the few who knows about the affair between East and the aristocratic English woman Grace McAlister (Charlotte Rampling). Things inevitably take a turn towards the tragic when East becomes determined to force Grace to leave her husband and run away with him. Hammers Over The Anvil is an evocative coming of age film from Australian director Ann Turner.","popularity":1.673,"poster_path":"/pJ31JmgkiTGc1xFnW9vRfTJjOId.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96093,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harvest Productions Pty.
