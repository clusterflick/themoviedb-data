And although there was a light rain and the concert was entirely outdoors, the huge crowd, some of them with umbrellas, were clearly transported by the music and by the performers who represented a cross-section of the best of classical and jazz artists. The concert started about 10:30am at night and lasted until 1am. And rain or not, it didn't look like anyone left. The audience was considerably younger than one would see at a typical classical music or even a typical jazz concert. And it appeared that everyone was having a marvelous time.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":"/2G75ALgjZJGsGodcrG10sCK9dPg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swinging Bach: Bobby Mcferrin & Guests","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1575,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2G75ALgjZJGsGodcrG10sCK9dPg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1100}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
