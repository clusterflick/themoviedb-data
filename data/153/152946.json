The twentysomething Lisbon resident has been hailed as the successor to fado legend Am√°lia Rodrigues; now, after two well-received CDs, comes Mariza's first filmed concert performance, and it is stunning. Mariza is backed primarily by acoustic guitar, acoustic bass guitar, and \"Portuguese guitar,\" a 12-string instrument that looks something like a lute and sounds a bit like a Greek bouzouki; there is some piano as well, and Guy Barker's muted trumpet provides \"O Deserto\" with a pronounced jazzy feel. But the singer is the main attraction here, and the power and passion of Mariza's delivery on \"Barco Negro\" and nearly all the others in the 16-song set, including more upbeat, celebratory numbers like \"Oica La o Senhor Vinho\" (the introductions are in English, but the tunes are all in Portuguese) are undeniable.","popularity":0.0646,"poster_path":"/6wFHLr9LgHjKqFUEm9LwyWIP3r4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mariza: Live in London","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1133527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariza","original_name":"Mariza","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/rbppewLXD8xMlb71Hxz0k837SlI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4b339251416c910d312d","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":879,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6wFHLr9LgHjKqFUEm9LwyWIP3r4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
