His materials are household paints on aluminium surfaces and his subject's, he says, are \"flora, fauna and portraits\". The results are elegant, delicate, simple yet elusive and exquisite. Playing gloriously with colour and light, they are paintings of subtle tones, idiosyncratic clashes and insistent reflections.  Interviewed in his studio, Gary Hume reflects on his work from the 1980s, when his Doors series won instant acclaim, to his latest creations.  Illustrated in this profile are many of Gary Hume's most notable paintings, specially filmed in exhibitions in London and Dublin, and in a major 2004 show in Bregenz, Austria. Also featured are the artist's rarely-seen drawings and, in contrasting settings, his deadpan sculpture Snowman.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1LuuTbfoQpyMu3LUma9b0DSxdbk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"theEYE: Gary Hume","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1LuuTbfoQpyMu3LUma9b0DSxdbk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
