The nest is finally empty, they've put the family home up for sale, and they're preparing to spend their retirement years traveling. But all that's easier said than done as Mike and a very pregnant Carol, each with their own agenda for wanting their parents to stay put, team up to sabotage the move.

Meanwhile, Chrissie, an aspiring singer, just wants to get out from under her parents' watchful gaze so she can launch her career as a rock
