Debt levels are unsustainable, world financial markets are calling for constant bailouts, and the US is continuing to antagonize the Middle East with military intervention.  Any number of these crises can lead to a break down in the social order of the high density urban areas of the United States.  Could you survive without public utilities or supermarkets through a winter?  Are there enough people around you that are prepared to band together and help one another during social unrest? More and more people are reevaluating their living arrangements to be prepared for prolonged disasters.  But what if you have to stay in a big city for work?  Have you developed some contingency plans?  Are you located in a part of the city that will allow escape through the rural byways?  Have you made a transportation plan? And, what can be done to secure your home now in case you can't get out in a crisis? Strategic Relocation has the answers.","popularity":0.213,"poster_path":"/ayXaH7SnrzukfCfnlvxbRSsfeUH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Joel Skousen details the safest places to live and how to secure your home.","title":"Strategic Relocation","video":true,"vote_average":0.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex E.
