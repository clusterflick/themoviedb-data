But in October 2008, less than a decade after Fred Goodwin took over as chief executive, it came within hours of collapsing. RBS later posted the biggest loss in UK corporate history - 24 billion pounds - which damaged the bank's reputation for financial prudence and Scotland's image as a global financial centre. Using previously unbroadcast footage of the bank's top executives and interviews with bank insiders, this documentary tells the compelling story of a national catastrophe.","popularity":0.2386,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RBS: Inside the Bank That Ran Out of Money","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2469367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Murray","original_name":"Colin Murray","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ddf2bcc0cd44600193154f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
