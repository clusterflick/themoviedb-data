Mom tells him what a no-account his dad really was, setting sail for Hawaii (\"no, Maw, it was Catalina\") right after the kids were born. Peter is unswayed, and takes off. He turns a barrel into a boat, and crews it with an annoyingly talkative duckling, then sets sail on a lake. They get caught in a thunderstorm (the duck loves it). Peter calls for help and momma comes running, but the duck has already saved him. But he still wants to be a sailor.","popularity":0.9634,"poster_path":"/w94NsplX8tPJaxT8BMkkMrO3QjO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Wanna Be a Sailor","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elvia Allman","original_name":"Elvia Allman","popularity":0.2032,"profile_path":"/r8MDamNJNwi83TXXn4lt41PtmTD.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mama (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe4b1b9251416c910cff73","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Blanc","original_name":"Mel Blanc","popularity":1.2076,"profile_path":"/8fevv4K06TmHsYom2XfmxgKrTcd.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Gabby Duckling (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe4b1b9251416c910cff77","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Bletcher","original_name":"Billy Bletcher","popularity":0.4537,"profile_path":"/ncapDtCeDsMJxEKFXocJTFfnpau.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Papa Parrot (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe4b1b9251416c910cff7b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":978032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Winkler","original_name":"Robert Winkler","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Peter Parrot (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe4b1b9251416c910cff7f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernice Hansen","original_name":"Bernice Hansen","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":"/1T1q0UvWl1xO3pmUbUdDIXz6gvZ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Patrick Parrot / Patricia Parrot (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f14c5582afb25003541ec69","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149374,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leon Schlesinger","original_name":"Leon Schlesinger","popularity":0.1328,"profile_path":"/is9gdhtLfaCYwWdeACDgAjdDA1w.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b1a9251416c910cff5d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tex Avery","original_name":"Tex Avery","popularity":0.5622,"profile_path":"/4jimJwW6FNAxBuM2CD1cZLK6Q5C.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b1a9251416c910cff57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149379,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Treg Brown","original_name":"Treg Brown","popularity":0.237,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b1a9251416c910cff69","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":551674,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carl W.
