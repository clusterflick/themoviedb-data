Praying to and fondling a priapic mushroom, she is unaware of the evil rapist shadowing her. When the rape occurs, it is in long shot, hidden from view, under a huge tree.

A few minutes later it stops; then another tree, a few feet away, begins to sway in identical fashion. The rapist finally emerges, exhausted.\" (Amos Vogel, Film as a Subversive Art)","popularity":0.0726,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1966-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rape","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Klein","original_name":"Laura Klein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sister Petrunkinsky","credit_id":"52fe4b329251416c910d30a9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henk Kort","original_name":"Henk Kort","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Rapist","credit_id":"52fe4b329251416c910d30ad","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1133512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wim van der Linden","original_name":"Wim van der Linden","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b329251416c910d30a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1247307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wim T.
