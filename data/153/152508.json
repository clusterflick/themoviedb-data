He practices his ancient craft in a village near Beijing while taking care of his deaf and dumb wife Pearl, who he rescued from her family's mistreatment. Winter brings a police crackdown on both fortune tellers and prostitutes, forcing Li and Pearl into temporary exile in his hometown, where he revisits old family demons. His humble story is told with chapter headings similar to Qing Dynasty popular fiction.","popularity":0.257,"poster_path":"/jobq587XT4qEQlCbAPvlzWIPQy1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":157,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fortune Teller","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"算命","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4753925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"厉百程","original_name":"厉百程","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"厉百程","credit_id":"665eb9d73a3b4fe5ea9d5ebf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4753927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"石珍珠","original_name":"石珍珠","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"石珍珠","credit_id":"665eb9f86c6435bbd1b824f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4753932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"唐小雁","original_name":"唐小雁","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"唐小雁","credit_id":"665ebaad2b388aba88517119","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xu Tong","original_name":"Xu Tong","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":"/fEelDmB1gKX7mjtLBM8vGC4r80n.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b239251416c910d1023","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1847591","wikidata_id":"Q114988981","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/jobq587XT4qEQlCbAPvlzWIPQy1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":663,"name":"fortune teller"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"The 4th Beijing Independent Film Festival","release_date":"2009-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Icarus Films / dGenerate Films","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
