Filmmakers Andres Maimik and Jaak Kilmi study the cases of the following kids: K채tlin, M채rt, Marek and Indrek. All of them have experienced more violence in their own way than most of the kids of their age. The film brings the viewer to a sad journey to the hidden and traumatic zone in society. The filmmakers try to talk to the children, parents and teachers about the subjects that are often referred to only in abstract ways.","popularity":0.1145,"poster_path":"/o3dh69vhCXTDXzzd3YueHHznRlU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112643,"logo_path":null,"name":"R체hm Pluss Null","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2001-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elf Disco","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1510425,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erik Norkroos","original_name":"Erik Norkroos","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/juRhsX1ILWPwp6E8xDIyR8ptV0Y.jpg","credit_id":"64e7a0f55258ae012ca49cdf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Maimik","original_name":"Andres Maimik","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/pD1yb9hm7XhdGieAvebYsRP3JGp.jpg","credit_id":"64e7a0c5c613ce012cc4a9c3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaak Kilmi","original_name":"Jaak Kilmi","popularity":0.0793,"profile_path":"/nYfeVvTvfdqRCZVgup1Jc029VR0.jpg","credit_id":"64e7a0d690ea4b011e78a3f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1337369,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kersti Miilen","original_name":"Kersti Miilen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/l6IITqRPtVVYdjxaL1VAowCRjsE.jpg","credit_id":"64e7a105c613ce014dfb8fb8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Maimik","original_name":"Andres Maimik","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/pD1yb9hm7XhdGieAvebYsRP3JGp.jpg","credit_id":"64e7a10d1feac10138d9d34e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andres Maimik","original_name":"Andres Maimik","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/pD1yb9hm7XhdGieAvebYsRP3JGp.jpg","credit_id":"64e7a0c0e894a6011ef7abfe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137660,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaak Kilmi","original_name":"Jaak Kilmi","popularity":0.0793,"profile_path":"/nYfeVvTvfdqRCZVgup1Jc029VR0.jpg","credit_id":"64e7a0d15258ae010bd8f06d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1510425,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erik Norkroos","original_name":"Erik Norkroos","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/juRhsX1ILWPwp6E8xDIyR8ptV0Y.jpg","credit_id":"64e7a0eec613ce014dfb8fab","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o3dh69vhCXTDXzzd3YueHHznRlU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
