About 25 minutes in duration, it was written for private performance by two pianos and chamber ensemble; Saint-Saëns prohibited public performance of the work during his lifetime, feeling that its frivolity would damage his standing as a serious composer. The suite was published in 1922, the year after his death. A public performance in the same year was greeted with enthusiasm, and it has remained among his most popular. It is less frequently performed with a full orchestral complement of strings.","popularity":0.1397,"poster_path":"/npxVbzMTKgFLjtJ3I65D3IbHDGh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Carnival of the Animals","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Arditi","original_name":"Pierre Arditi","popularity":0.5328,"profile_path":"/kLvyrJkfcGUKzn3rHI0SYX5uPwj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Présentateur","credit_id":"64e9a7c0e894a600e4e6b679","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588711,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Camille Saint-Saëns","original_name":"Camille Saint-Saëns","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/7YL4aEDc8neHz2pCS1JXrYK1zhQ.jpg","credit_id":"64e9a802c3c89100c6830be0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/npxVbzMTKgFLjtJ3I65D3IbHDGh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
