Until recently, she went to school as Josu√©. Her coming out at the age of 13 is initially positive, but after just a few weeks she is met with increasing rejection. Soraya also experiences resistance at home. Her father hopes that his child might \"change her mind\" again. Soraya, on the other hand, fights for early hormone delivery and an early operation. Over a period of six years, a touching film was made which, beyond the individual fate, contributes to the debate about transidentity and homophobia.","popularity":0.0451,"poster_path":"/5ojTcqWiM6S6djdde2msYsiCDl7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call Me Soraya","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4234596,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Stadelmann","original_name":"Daniel Stadelmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e93d4cc3c891013ab21777","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4234596,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Stadelmann","original_name":"Daniel Stadelmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e93d6fe894a600ae744176","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4234597,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Otmar Schmid","original_name":"Otmar Schmid","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e93d7b1feac1011b2d6748","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28326033","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6EEou8sxRncYWfidALzqRfZlCA0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5ojTcqWiM6S6djdde2msYsiCDl7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
