In this short documentary, director Eva Sjerps shows from up close, focusing on the senses, what these sessions with youngsters look like. How do horses react to the children? And what does the horses’ reaction do to the adolescents? During these interactions, the horses mirror the behaviour of young people who contend with various problems. In the process, they are able to recognise their underlying feelings and behavioural patterns and can subsequently change them.","popularity":0.1017,"poster_path":"/s7OVq4I0W4QDf8U2D1GbKJtu6ZT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Interakt Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spiegel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4226281,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guus Buijing","original_name":"Guus Buijing","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64edf7fa594c9400e2617d3b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673193,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"René Mendel","original_name":"René Mendel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e89d6206f984012d728ade","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Delpeut","original_name":"Peter Delpeut","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/x24s1TXxJt4Sstv0x1eag6GnvMQ.jpg","credit_id":"64e89e0fe894a6013bb05b58","department":"Writing","job":"Script Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3212881,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marcel Oudendijk","original_name":"Marcel Oudendijk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e89e82594c9400ffe60b7b","department":"Production","job":"Post Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1887754,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mira Mendel","original_name":"Mira Mendel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e89d73458199013a7de35e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4233460,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lennert Hunfeld","original_name":"Lennert Hunfeld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e89e521feac10138da5027","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1790391,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Menno Euwe","original_name":"Menno Euwe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e89dece894a6013bb05b41","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4233456,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivar Trentelman","original_name":"Ivar Trentelman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e89df790ea4b00e49d9bf1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4233447,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Sjerps","original_name":"Eva Sjerps","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e89d3f1feac10138da4fca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Delpeut","original_name":"Peter Delpeut","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/x24s1TXxJt4Sstv0x1eag6GnvMQ.jpg","credit_id":"64e89e43594c9400c5536007","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288716,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Qianwei Tong","original_name":"Qianwei Tong","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e89e6f5258ae00eaa40710","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4233450,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikki Thie","original_name":"Nikki Thie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e89d83e894a6013bb05b13","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4233455,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anneloes Pabbruwee","original_name":"Anneloes Pabbruwee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e89de045819900ada90cf8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296155,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stella Van Voorst van Beest","original_name":"Stella Van Voorst van Beest","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"650a252f81c7be00c699e163","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mpYMhpQ7I1VMDsymm7m8Qwvs13N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s7OVq4I0W4QDf8U2D1GbKJtu6ZT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1365}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"Nederlands Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
