There seems to be an inherent mysterious connection between wind, water, sunlight, and bamboo shadows. Bamboo is one of the symbols of ancient Chinese culture. There are many traditional paintings about bamboo. This film uses Super 8mm film to shoot bamboo, looking at \"Bamboo\" with a contemporary eye and medium. It seems to be a dynamic Chinese ink sketch on film, with a poetic meaning. Shot and edited by Gao Wei on her rooftop garden. She plants bamboo by herself.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tdFU8C7o7OzJFrNWZofmj7qdzzK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2022-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bamboo in the Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3821228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gao Wei","original_name":"Gao Wei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e8cb1be894a600ae742a8d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1396,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tdFU8C7o7OzJFrNWZofmj7qdzzK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":931}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"The 1st Chengdu International Photography Festival","release_date":"2022-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"The 10th Annual New Year/New Work Film Festival","release_date":"2023-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
