However, instead of stopping them, women have fought to break down these barriers and continue to grow in the sport. \"Beyond the impediment\" is a short documentary that uses different perspectives to address women's persistence and passion for football. Here, it's forward and the game continues. This film was created and produced by students of the NÓIS NO DOC ONLINE 2023 course, carried out as part of the É NÓIS NA FITA project.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/AkPjURvMV7120rrr8ILVu0sc7Dx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":205005,"logo_path":null,"name":"é nois na
