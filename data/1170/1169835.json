Aurand’s 16mm films are portraits of people and place, often prompted by the discovery and experience of travel. As George Clark has written, the journey is a cornerstone of Aurand’s filmmaking: \"“Her work builds out from fragments, detours, refrains and returns; her camera picks up discarded gestures and suspends them in time. Films are always moving, always fleeting, Aurand’s work reminds us. These qualities are as fundamental to lived experience as they are to the cinema. Throughout Ute Aurand’s work we encounter a world animated by her mobile and dynamic camera, following, chasing, leading and dissecting space.\"","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":"/x8GsOWV0pBMkZKZE8KY7J0Gd8aY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Brasil","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1145419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ute Aurand","original_name":"Ute Aurand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5R1DsvP1zbaIGqI68FltbjSOUCG.jpg","credit_id":"64e9bd77c613ce014dfc66b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1416,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iiANpeBJf0omHZZCJzMsxzKEOIg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2517}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x8GsOWV0pBMkZKZE8KY7J0Gd8aY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jeonju International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
