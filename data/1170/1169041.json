Smith's journey as a self-described sissy with a body he found humiliating as he developed his art to become a radical drag performer and genderqueer artist. A unique blend of DIY documentary, road trip, performance art, and videopoem, this amusing self-portrait sources Smith's provocative art practice to examine a lifetime of untrue stories about his body. One featured project includes Smith on a road trip on British Columbia's Sunshine Coast, searching for famed Canadian singer Joni Mitchell, while dressed as Peanut the Clown.","popularity":0.0982,"poster_path":"/6i8Yb4Ysnvqrl0d9yEdsFXB3nfd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Floating Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2475098,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael V.
