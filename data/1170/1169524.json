Through a series of memories surrounding her girlfriend, \"Day\", viewers are drawn-into the whirlwind of their relationship, from start to finish. Time passes with great speed; the women meet, fall in love, and pursue a committed, loving relationship. This relationship is then uprooted by an apparent unnamed medical diagnosis. These aforementioned memories are coupled with a conversation between the women; a conversation which addresses Charity's relapsed substance abuse addictions, infidelity, and thoughts of suicide. Charity is in desperate need of being forgiven; it is only after Day forgives her - that the true, underlying nature of this conversation between the women is revealed.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/3TWaAXRsObaUWtEmtFjaiQQHRNr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forgiving Charity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3170737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shayne Eastin","original_name":"Shayne Eastin","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":"/hBi9yAF8RBmz8nShnIvAXHUDdRW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64e8dfb290ea4b0101f6a77c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3796570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Skye LaFontaine","original_name":"Skye LaFontaine","popularity":0.1048,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64e8dfd8e894a600c72884d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3618003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caiti Wiggins","original_name":"Caiti Wiggins","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64e8dfdfc3c89101007ce051","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4233865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamin Scotti","original_name":"Jamin Scotti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e8df83c3c891013ab2030d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23554264","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3TWaAXRsObaUWtEmtFjaiQQHRNr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gVYob0PrOn774ZJC0iolGHhcIqy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":507}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
