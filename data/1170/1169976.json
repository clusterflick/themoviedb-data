With the help of adventurous profiteer Mark, they produce weapons for the resistance movement. This work continues even after the war, because their \"benefactor\" releases fictitious reports on German victories in order to maintain underground production and continue to get rich. Marko manages to convince his best friend Crni (Black) to stay hidden in the basement so that he can keep Natalia for himself, the woman they both love. After twenty years, Crni finds a way out into the \"upper world\". Although it is 1961, Crni believes that the Nazis are still in power because they managed to make a film showing the German occupation.","popularity":0.2153,"poster_path":"/f7yIwuHTIRaJcXMphxjTQPtiZt9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63904,"logo_path":"/fKDAYIJat7fpbWnjgdHchpg5AbQ.png","name":"Fakultet Dramskih Umetnosti Beograd (FDU)","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":25204,"logo_path":"/gFf9pISFzsNKkoDuWVnLwmRF5V0.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2019-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spring in January","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1776057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jovan Belobrković","original_name":"Jovan Belobrković","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nenad","credit_id":"64ea17eb5258ae00eaa48d35","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3269660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amar Ćorović","original_name":"Amar Ćorović","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/g7DpiAqAhtV5CVlIEo2smHIH15j.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Miša","credit_id":"64ea17f3e894a60101218e3b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1538759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Đorđević","original_name":"Ivan Đorđević","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Marko","credit_id":"64ea180383901800af813eef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1869778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milica Janevski","original_name":"Milica Janevski","popularity":0.2256,"profile_path":"/xj9JsLJzPANOIeonIyxzV9Sbigq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Natalija","credit_id":"64ea180c1feac100e16a9dbb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2110779,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mira Janjetović","original_name":"Mira Janjetović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Unuka","credit_id":"64ea181545819900e3530ce3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2908849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nedim Nezirović","original_name":"Nedim Nezirović","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Jovan","credit_id":"64ea182e594c9400acb07ed0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1416286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mateja Popović","original_name":"Mateja Popović","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Crni","credit_id":"64ea183ac3c891011d9f1736","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mladen Sovilj","original_name":"Mladen Sovilj","popularity":0.1681,"profile_path":"/MzQQy0RWkdc9MYpznrWAvBWOLG.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Bata","credit_id":"64ea1843c613ce00c9f24787","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3058236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jovan Dimoski","original_name":"Jovan Dimoski","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ea17be5258ae014df2c0fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4235547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksa Mihajlović","original_name":"Aleksa Mihajlović","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ea17c6458199011d2b35d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4235548,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ivona Janjić","original_name":"Ivona Janjić","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ea17cdc613ce010b8d2964","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70877,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dušan Kovačević","original_name":"Dušan Kovačević","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/fW2ltI01q8o6JXxN2LIzqE0rfv3.jpg","credit_id":"64ea17dde894a600ae749380","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11457716","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f7yIwuHTIRaJcXMphxjTQPtiZt9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
