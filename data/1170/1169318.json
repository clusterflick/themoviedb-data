Some didn't lose their lives, but instead lost everything that was important to them: their family, their religious identity, their childhood, and their way of life.  This Documentary Short profiles Wilhelmina De Kadt, now Willie Juhlin, whose family lived in The Netherlands during World War II. Willie and her brother avoided being sent to a concentration camp, through the kindness of  others and a bit of luck. She survived by hiding in plain sight with a Catholic family, and was eventually reunited with her only surviving adult family member, who brought her to America to start a new life.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/v0XLdIPRShxNTftgx3gqZhfHZbS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Plain Sight A Hidden Child of the Holocaust","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4233114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willie Juhlin","original_name":"Willie Juhlin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"64e8427ef2cf2500adf3133c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4223601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carli Platt","original_name":"Carli Platt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e8423ac3c89100aed9005a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4223601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carli Platt","original_name":"Carli Platt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e8455ce894a6011ef7f8f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4223601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carli Platt","original_name":"Carli Platt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e84565594c940139c86240","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1572,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v0XLdIPRShxNTftgx3gqZhfHZbS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1064},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6uw4Z7sIGO0908m5V9VGsj9R1sg.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1728},{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1554,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iDBi3UXY4NyQOkrfpsagbszYg76.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1106},{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":1578,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/acnBBESbZbD9Rx6qFre88UvYfIR.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1078},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1578,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9v8pWyILMLwL9EgHWTXGvnun526.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1060}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"In Plain Sight: A Hidden Child of the Holocaust","key":"2gQmaomhSTM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2018-10-26T21:04:42.000Z","id":"64e842c090ea4b013b82a2ff"}]}}}
