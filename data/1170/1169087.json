But over the decades, Rashid's heart beat firmly at twenty four frames per second as he traversed many worlds, re-living Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Werner Herzog, Abbas Kiarostami and more; along with books on cinema and poetry. This is a film about him, his cafe, his neighbourhood and a world of erasure, accelerating in the time of covid. A dedicated bachelor who 'lived life vicariously through movies', RIP, Rashid Irani.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2021-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If Memory Serves me Right","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3034392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafeeq Ellias","original_name":"Rafeeq Ellias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e79638c613ce00c9f15ea2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2422974,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Abhro Banerjee","original_name":"Abhro Banerjee","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64e79641594c9400c552ea22","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
