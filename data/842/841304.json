He has convinced Esmeralda, the caretaker of his hacienda, under the promise of leaving her the resources she needs to go live with her daughter and granddaughter in Baltimore. She only has one condition. She will not do anything unless Father Pablo vows to hear her confession after the act. Pablo decides to stay in the hacienda indefinitely, to impede them from doing anything. But he hardly does anything himself - and his time with Esmeralda will make him confront with his sense of goodness, and to check his pride and dogma, and the love he never found for his father.","popularity":0.2924,"poster_path":"/8BeF05H5djO13jlI5yeAPwNio08.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160960,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sopa de piedra films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2021-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father Pablo","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","title":"Padre Pablo","type":"Título en español"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Father Pablo","type":"Inglés"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3234938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafael Martínez Sánchez","original_name":"Rafael Martínez Sánchez","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":"/rje8xNzTKfCNf46P8rlbOsit27i.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Padre Pablo","credit_id":"6140f85faaf897002a019ed0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antón Araiza","original_name":"Antón Araiza","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Padre Rubén","credit_id":"6140f87185c0a200897153fa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1549905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Ramos","original_name":"Carmen Ramos","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/mz4k76G72CdVPedFUsQCbwxlyh0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Esmeralda","credit_id":"6140f87cec4552002b43e76b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Ignacio Aranda","original_name":"Juan Ignacio Aranda","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":"/9uAtyw2HVi8kKzH1Z4fhWscIC5C.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Manolo","credit_id":"6140f888fd7aa4004294e860","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1271517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Gonzalez Bello","original_name":"Ana González Bello","popularity":0.1114,"profile_path":"/kZEc6KQaHmfHMyU2y2EkaLFQhcl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Daniela","credit_id":"6140f895594c94008ba54acb","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Luis Isoard Arrubarrena","original_name":"José Luis Isoard Arrubarrena","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140f8aeaf85de0062822ad8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2515807,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gonzalo Romero","original_name":"Gonzalo Romero","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140f8de5e12000063c25929","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2746066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianna Cisneros","original_name":"Gianna Cisneros","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140f8ec9979d2009051252e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1549952,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Miguel Ángel Galo","original_name":"Miguel Ángel Galo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140f8bc006b010063ee48d1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14406956","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"sopadepiedrafilms","instagram_id":"sopa.de.piedra","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w3dVMc6SunF5tysBlHMUnGWY6J7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/8BeF05H5djO13jlI5yeAPwNio08.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":534,"name":"mexico"},{"id":160223,"name":"vancouver"},{"id":281449,"name":"guanajuato"},{"id":285004,"name":"puruagua"},{"id":285005,"name":"isoard"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Vancouver International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
