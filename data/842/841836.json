The photos illustrate the Dublin of 1904 which served as a backdrop to James Joyce’s Ulysses.  The film traces Joyce’s childhood and adolescence, his meeting with Nora Barnacle on June 10th, 1904, and the highways and byways which Leopold Bloom wandered through on June 16th, 1904. The music in the film references some of Joyce’s favourite songs, many of which appear in Ulysses.","popularity":0.1834,"poster_path":"/bmhdBS8PhQYxArnHJ1oHoMTnQHp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110657,"logo_path":null,"name":"B.A.C.
