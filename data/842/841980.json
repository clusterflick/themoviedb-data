The disappearance of the neighborhood (in Jaboatão dos Guararapes, Pernambuco), due to structural problems, real estate speculation and a long and turbid imbroglio between residents and agencies responsible for the work, is witnessed through resilience and resistance, affective landscapes and memories , who sometimes seek shelter in nostalgia, sometimes rekindle the resolute flame of hope.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/jByes82Hqo4Md79zqxyT715SYlr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156338,"logo_path":null,"name":"Senda","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2021-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Muribeca","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3127743,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alcione
