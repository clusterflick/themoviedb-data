He returns to his hometown Fukuoka to take care of his sick father Hideo, but is rejected by his father. Tatsuya meets Jinbo and Yui, who work as mediators between Japan and Nepal. He joins the Nepalese community through them, and while his world expands through these encounters, he also learns of the difficulties of foreigners living in Japan.  Shot in the town where many Nepalese actually live, this drama casted authentic epalese as actors. The title “Masala” refers to a mixed spice, and is also used as a metaphor here for the diverse society.","popularity":0.5926,"poster_path":"/wYEC99aIDOIFJrgVa4PNxgx13Lp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2020-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tonari no Masala","title":"My Neighbor's Masala","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1680187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanta Sato","original_name":"佐藤寛太","popularity":0.5144,"profile_path":"/axfo43IeEVQkm4sN8UWe0EODYkt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sawaki Tatsuya","credit_id":"6106cee27a1bd60028e0dd50","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Mitsuishi","original_name":"光石研","popularity":1.3541,"profile_path":"/6MQodqe4Sc7Ga1R7FhiOl1msJ26.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6106cf488d22fc0076bb7855","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2234017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Goriken","original_name":"Goriken","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/gkco0J2fAhOIWvQexPRdlUSgvVT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6106cf72ad87f70073621bff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meiko Kaji","original_name":"梶芽衣子","popularity":0.835,"profile_path":"/vX5QZ9oyncMWL6zyhhVycepN4tm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6106cfabf706de08de07d819","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2634062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Azusa Ōhara","original_name":"Azusa Ōhara","popularity":0.0931,"profile_path":"/oMTU8Blpgpf8HfnfVSwNE35nXPJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6106cfbdad87f700461e2788","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1405926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toru Nomaguchi","original_name":"野間口徹","popularity":0.372,"profile_path":"/vK1z59SqOTIlDP8reCpLeNjtOII.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6106cfce7ad08c0045530e05","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4392492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kitasaka Masato","original_name":"Kitasaka Masato","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655ef1fc706e56011b484981","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wYEC99aIDOIFJrgVa4PNxgx13Lp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
