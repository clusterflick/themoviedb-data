The film opens with visits to typical old age pensioners living independently. We pay a visit to a typical block of low-rent flats, built specially for old people who can care for themselves. Special places are provided for those who can no longer live alone without attention. We see the famous De Gamles By, which has been criticised on a number of counts,  yet which has certain amenities provided by few other such places. We then visit a number of old people's homes, including a small one in a village, one of the most modern homes in Denmark in the prosperous Copenhagen suburb of Gentofte, and a typical average home.","popularity":0.1028,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":9079,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palladium Film","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1947-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De gamle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3127630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aksel Dahlerup","original_name":"Aksel Dahlerup","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Speaker (voice)","credit_id":"60cb1ddf99259c005973d108","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329401,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Susanne Palsbo","original_name":"Susanne Palsbo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Speaker (voice)","credit_id":"60cb1df2b0ba7e0029848cdb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2226900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralph Elton","original_name":"Ralph Elton","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"60cb1e312476f20057169519","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Torben Anton Svendsen","original_name":"Torben Anton Svendsen","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cb1d86b0ba7e003f5efbc0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Theodor Dreyer","original_name":"Carl Theodor Dreyer","popularity":0.2022,"profile_path":"/l4g1K4ai3HgAIg0267O5ppnknVX.jpg","credit_id":"60cb1d9966ae4d007af10447","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0308296","wikidata_id":"Q19827744","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"","release_date":"1947-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
