In February 1942, President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing the relocation and incarceration of tens of thousands of innocent American citizens of Japanese ancestry. Among these citizens was Gordon Hirabayashi, whose defiance of the internment order catapulted him into a 50-year journey of conscience to protect the Constitution from a country that viewed him as the enemy. Hold These Truths was inspired by many hours of interviews conducted by playwright Jeanne Sakata with Mr. Hirabayashi as well as numerous primary sources from his life.","popularity":0.1442,"poster_path":"/7KWp2Y11cKJB0vhYrxLFyAXxCcB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143811,"logo_path":null,"name":"San Francisco Playhouse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hold These Truths","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2857697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jomar Tagatac","original_name":"Jomar Tagatac","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/icc4H47cb8n4u0eF9OwrSTLFQ2A.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gordon Hirabayashi","credit_id":"60cad8ec2fccee0056cd5249","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1219601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Sakata","original_name":"Jeanne Sakata","popularity":0.1194,"profile_path":"/vymNI3LBd9hwwfdQcrwzWA5I69s.jpg","credit_id":"60cad8ff99259c002a1981c1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3127398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeffrey Lo","original_name":"Jeffrey Lo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cad911773941006db30dd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/34maidvyNMAD4ezBG2lghGIH4TJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2880},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/grHNmP6fyBJjjxtOIqtotfMldKU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2880}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7KWp2Y11cKJB0vhYrxLFyAXxCcB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
