Now, that's a pretty drastic statement - pretty bold - in terms of religion, in terms of anybody's intelligent thinking. To most people who would consider themselves intelligent beings, they'd say, \"Well, that's absurd. What's all this doomsday stuff? What's all this prophetic, apocalyptic talk?\" You know, intelligent human beings should realize that all things have their own cycle. They have their season. They have their beginning, they have their end. We're not saying that planet Earth is coming to an end. We're saying that planet Earth is about to be refurbished, spaded under, and have another chance to serve as a garden for a future human civilization.\"","popularity":0.284,"poster_path":"/vjQvXeRgPBQ1w4X90l61TkIeOUl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Planet Earth About to Be Recycled: Your Only Chance to Survive Is to Leave with Us","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Planet Earth About To Be Recycled (Your Only Chance To Survive Is To Leave With Us)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1813635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marshall Applewhite","original_name":"Marshall Applewhite","popularity":0.0907,"profile_path":"/9LHObiT8zyStjzFKs7YoW1vbDkE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5fa563571d820f0042c06131","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1016,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vjQvXeRgPBQ1w4X90l61TkIeOUl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":678}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6158,"name":"cult"},{"id":9738,"name":"ufo"},{"id":162766,"name":"religious cult"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
