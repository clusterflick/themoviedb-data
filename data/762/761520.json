Of the infinite freedom offered by the black void, and of the strong, shining beacon inviting us to ascend. This is a story, a history of the events that led up to our conquest of space, and the consequences throughout wider humanity.  The film is a collage. Of genres, documentary and comedy. Of media, drawing from painting and film. Of films, cannibalising all film history. Of truth, both objective and subjective. Watch the small steps and let your mind take a giant leap.","popularity":0.5645,"poster_path":"/82dSeShWPI28L9NwomX9eyEQ6pC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From the Earth to the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1628476,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Gerrard","original_name":"Chris Gerrard","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5fa68e47fcb8cc003e82a8a4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1628476,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Gerrard","original_name":"Chris Gerrard","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa68e5c81383100419940ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/X2TyO6ey1LAWloWynAized9hjE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1836,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/82dSeShWPI28L9NwomX9eyEQ6pC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1224}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":305,"name":"moon"},{"id":7507,"name":"collage"},{"id":7422,"name":"moon landing"},{"id":170487,"name":"essay film"},{"id":208226,"name":"video collage"},{"id":222228,"name":"cinema history"},{"id":223393,"name":"superimposition"},{"id":224230,"name":"collage film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER: From the Earth to the Moon","key":"vzIvtOrqnAg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-03-21T08:07:38.000Z","id":"5fa68f7e21621d003ef4fbc4"}]}}}
