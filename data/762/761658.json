For 28 years, this 155 km wall divided Germany in two, separating friends and family. The recent discovery of some documents reveals the stories of those who managed to escape to join their loved ones, or simply to regain their freedom. Demonstrating imagination and courage, some dug tunnels to get under the Berlin Wall, others inflated balloons to fly over it, while others disguised themselves with fake uniforms. By combining archives, reconstitution sequences and intrigue scenes, this documentary plunges us into a Berlin that has now disappeared, through the prism of the art of escape under the GDR.","popularity":0.2497,"poster_path":"/ggtR0BGxdUS3XSKUuPv4bJkhE1H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78594,"logo_path":"/nbvR0hoJUXmG0t58vGpHiDEJVYg.png","name":"Flair Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":95251,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alpha-Zoulou Films","origin_country":""},{"id":11237,"logo_path":"/nzPEges9ftjCDQWru0qrIfTX8OR.png","name":"ZDF/Arte","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":61658,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radio Canada Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berlin Escape Artists","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Great Berlin Escapes","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446168,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean Bergeron","original_name":"Jean Bergeron","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa6fabbdf857c003f5267e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2359975,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Guillaume Millet","original_name":"Guillaume Millet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa6fb34323eba004125fc88","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2478019,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxime Roger","original_name":"Maxime Roger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa6fb263a340b0040c1f5f4","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2847163,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thierry Durel","original_name":"Thierry Durel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa6fb04a402c1004032f42d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20505,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Massett","original_name":"Patrick Massett","popularity":0.3229,"profile_path":"/ln8HyFKlRT8AAs9HMD2PO4e6NNv.jpg","credit_id":"5fa6fae6c68b69003fa40139","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1576088,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nicolas Venne","original_name":"Nicolas Venne","popularity":0.076,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa6faf83a340b0040c1f5ad","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2481396,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Grégoire Deslandes","original_name":"Grégoire Deslandes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa6fb4fa402c1004232eb87","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421900,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elric Robichon","original_name":"Elric Robichon","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa6fb3e1b7294003d91f286","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11083444","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pLWSZ4yLHu5wql6rjxdV8sSQwIe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ggtR0BGxdUS3XSKUuPv4bJkhE1H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
