This is where the late Magnus Isacsson decided to film 18 months in the lives of four young men aged 17 to 22: Danny, Alex, Mickerson and Michael. Music is central to all of their lives. More than just a pastime, hip-hop is their outlet for coping with their demons. With the help of their teacher, mentor and friend Don Karnage, and driven by a fierce desire to overcome hardship, they learn to be adults. Winner of the award for Best Canadian Feature Film at the most recent Montreal International Documentary Festival, Ma vie réelle is an exceptionally astute document in which listening and generosity gain the power to defeat misery.","popularity":1.0365,"poster_path":"/mTYFaMkUHN5SJ4E25eN7KsmLNST.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98425,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amazone Film","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2012-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Real Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2847786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Bryson","original_name":"Alexandre Bryson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Alexandre Bryson","credit_id":"5fa7b0d78c7b0f00407a5384","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2847787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Karnage","original_name":"Don Karnage","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Don Karnage","credit_id":"5fa7b0dfdf857c004153f2ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2847788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Raymond","original_name":"Danny Raymond","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Danny Raymond","credit_id":"5fa7b0e6211ce5003b84b057","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2847789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Stiverne","original_name":"Michael Stiverne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Michael Stiverne","credit_id":"5fa7b0f221621d003ef6aafd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2847790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikerson Stiverne","original_name":"Mikerson Stiverne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mikerson Stiverne","credit_id":"5fa7b0fa8c7b0f003f7b3e03","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1484614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Magnus Isacsson","original_name":"Magnus Isacsson","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa7b0af1b7294003c94e608","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2022210,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Franck Le Coroller","original_name":"Franck Le Coroller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa7b0bf43494f003f1d9d43","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2697100","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/mTYFaMkUHN5SJ4E25eN7KsmLNST.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6147,"name":"delinquency"},{"id":6719,"name":"montreal, canada"},{"id":233676,"name":"troubled youth"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"francais\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"français\"}","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
