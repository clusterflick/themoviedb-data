Adaptations have starred cinema legends from Boris Karloff to Robert De Niro – and even Alvin and the Chipmunks. From tales of science gone mad (Jurassic Park) to stories of understanding the other (ET, The Hulk, Arrival), traces of the story and its themes have spread across our media.  With Frankenstein Re-membered, video artist and film historian Chris Gerrard collects these diverse fragments from the birth of cinema until the present day and in the tradition of Victor Frankenstein himself, attempts to stitch them back together into an adaptation of the original Shelley novel.","popularity":0.4225,"poster_path":"/ox7mz18lksKTPxpFyhV31IXJvRr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143277,"logo_path":null,"name":"Being Human","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frankenstein (Re)Membered","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1628476,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Gerrard","original_name":"Chris Gerrard","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Creature","credit_id":"5fa6830e8c7b0f00417784b2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1628476,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Gerrard","original_name":"Chris Gerrard","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa67666211ce5003d81591b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cTY4CnmUUamPgKEmfr3KeNdNubE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/diVU5JCflhn5Hj0Q0itF71YEctJ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ox7mz18lksKTPxpFyhV31IXJvRr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15032,"name":"gothic horror"},{"id":170487,"name":"essay film"},{"id":208226,"name":"video collage"},{"id":222228,"name":"cinema history"},{"id":223393,"name":"superimposition"},{"id":224230,"name":"collage film"},{"id":258464,"name":"frankenstein"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER: Frankenstein ReMembered","key":"NwzGDDkvr_o","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-11-10T11:42:06.000Z","id":"5fa67d1a21621d0040f65ef8"}]}}}
