It was reputedly the main source that informed democratic South Africa’s liberal constitution and a constant reference point for the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and rival political parties that it spawned since 1994, all claiming the Freedom Charter’s legacy. Freedom Isn’t Free assesses the history and role of the charter, especially in relation to key political and socio-economic aspects of developments in South Africa up to the present period. It includes rare archival footage with interviews of a cross-section of outspoken influential South Africans.","popularity":0.4229,"poster_path":"/ixryQSBR7pPhsLMCTEv043ELmMd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143334,"logo_path":null,"name":"Workers’ World Media Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2018-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freedom Isn't Free — The Freedom Charter Today","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","title":"Freedom is Not Free","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1879009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Faniswa Yisa","original_name":"Faniswa Yisa","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/wD3SqOjnUMFq291AOW3gxz4iLVI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5fa7baa9ab6849003f695c13","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2847850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Jansen","original_name":"Martin Jansen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa7b7f3abf8e20040411d4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2847866,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ashika Sato","original_name":"Ashika Sato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa7b9f634e15200407a9a81","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2847850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Jansen","original_name":"Martin Jansen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa7bb0eab6849003f695c37","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1769587,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kyle Shepherd","original_name":"Kyle Shepherd","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa7ba1ba402c1004134120d","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2847870,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Dan Dewes","original_name":"Dan Dewes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa7ba631d820f0040c5208d","department":"Crew","job":"Mixing Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2847850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Jansen","original_name":"Martin Jansen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa7bade34e1520042789b16","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":838,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ixryQSBR7pPhsLMCTEv043ELmMd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":590}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":592,"name":"capitalism"},{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":6089,"name":"freedom"},{"id":1773,"name":"socialism"},{"id":3644,"name":"south africa"},{"id":4106,"name":"apartheid"},{"id":4936,"name":"constitution"},{"id":4339,"name":"johannesburg, south africa"},{"id":4737,"name":"anc (african national congress)"},{"id":5856,"name":"nelson mandela"},{"id":14737,"name":"economics"},{"id":33640,"name":"democracy"},{"id":158217,"name":"colonialism"},{"id":164400,"name":"labor union"},{"id":168483,"name":"student protest"},{"id":176806,"name":"cape town, south africa"},{"id":190638,"name":"workers union"},{"id":209463,"name":"neo-colonialism"},{"id":264940,"name":"pretoria, south africa"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"African Film Festival New Zealand, 2020","release_date":"2020-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"World premiere in Cape Town","release_date":"2018-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
