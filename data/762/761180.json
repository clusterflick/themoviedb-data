By means of montage and optical recombination the film takes these historical fragments and builds them up to a frantic pitch. The film seeks to depict the frenetic digital information age but entirely through traditional photomechanical methods, a reversal of the norm. The sound design enhances the film's transformations, and provides a sensitive counterpoint to the \"colonial eye.\" The role of the colonist as exploiter of natural and human resources is evident, the filmic mediation brings these images into a contemporary context.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9mk3EbqvT6P84PMUqXjTEeFGAf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Synaesthetic Anaesthesia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2845413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Kneller","original_name":"John Kneller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa5320c3a340b0040bf19f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9mk3EbqvT6P84PMUqXjTEeFGAf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
