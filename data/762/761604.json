Believing that live music will help his recovery, and frustrated by his aphasia, a communication disorder brought on by stroke, Filipe attempts to reconnect with the world by visiting music festivals dressed as a bunny rabbit.  After showing signs of improvement, the stress and anxiety caused by his ambition plunge him into depression and epilepsy. He perseveres, but a new diagnosis of bipolar disorder lands him in hospital, following a dramatic and confusing visit to the United States.  As he learns to accept that bunny will always be with him, Filipe finally gets a grip on reality when a fresh ray of hope gives him a new perspective.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mind Mending","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2846945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Markus Schröder","original_name":"Markus Schröder","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa6c53921621d003df6b809","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2846945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Markus Schröder","original_name":"Markus Schröder","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa6c5491d820f0042c27482","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
