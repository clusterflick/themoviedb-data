Morelli, who after seeing the work, is confronted with a confusing, complex and, in part, incomprehensible work. Helped by the young widow of Abramo Malonga and by the notes left by his deceased friend, and again by his personal memories, the Italian director attempts to reconstruct and complete the film. Fausto's work progresses with difficulty, not only because of the problems the film poses for him, but because of the problems that arise in his daily life. After a long crisis, after which he returns to Pisa with his former party companions and abandons himself to love and his own solitude, Fausto takes up the work of his African friend, closing it with a final invention, in which , with a bold metaphor, has refigured the human condition of our time.","popularity":0.4467,"poster_path":"/dJXX8g27iD8ojy64Rw39G0FEl2J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Damned Of The Earth","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les Damnés de la Terre","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Wolff","original_name":"Frank Wolff","popularity":0.5285,"profile_path":"/xRbJq4GwVl5w3pRmWzQP9SehKE1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Fausto","credit_id":"5fa6c090c68b690040a16323","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":796326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marilù Tolo","original_name":"Marilù Tolo","popularity":0.3585,"profile_path":"/4xAgtaAowHI3wAqXMBGmraYpmnU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Adriana","credit_id":"5fa6c09d519bbb003d50fc27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2846909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serigne Ndiaye Gonzales","original_name":"Serigne Ndiaye Gonzales","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Abramo","credit_id":"5fa6c0b1700bf70040579a03","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlo Cecchi","original_name":"Carlo Cecchi","popularity":0.2962,"profile_path":"/ek6bObZ1kimovsmHSVjX861vQlA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ingardo","credit_id":"5fa6c0bd9ac5350042b48ee7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":33816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Malfatti","original_name":"Marina Malfatti","popularity":0.218,"profile_path":"/iiAZP64wPni4EpE7CnENe0QB3RA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Luciana","credit_id":"5fa6c0c9a579f9003c77260e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Bisacco","original_name":"Roberto Bisacco","popularity":0.145,"profile_path":"/p6zlcPq6gHrBARtlWc3KHQiB3Ya.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5fa6c0d19ac5350040b3c2f8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1484693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisa Kadigia Bove","original_name":"Elisa Kadigia Bove","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5fa6c0d7fcb8cc0040815acb","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1665141,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paolo Lucignani","original_name":"Paolo Lucignani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa6c163519bbb003c524373","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933326,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Giuseppe Pinori","original_name":"Giuseppe Pinori","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa6c1548c7b0f003e7725c1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1191310,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Lina Nerli Taviani","original_name":"Lina Nerli Taviani","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa6c17ba579f9003d77663c","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":556723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valentino Orsini","original_name":"Valentino Orsini","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa6c0f1df857c004052682a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":556723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valentino Orsini","original_name":"Valentino Orsini","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa6c117ffc9de003d88dc00","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1501425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frantz Fanon","original_name":"Frantz Fanon","popularity":0.1139,"profile_path":"/sfbjgyLuYzr4Ae65eG94XxkqXMs.jpg","credit_id":"5fa6c19d8c7b0f003e772899","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":332350,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Giuliani G.
