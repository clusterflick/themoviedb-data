They make a treasure map and keep half each. Later, Zheng’s brother finds out Fan has died. The film opens when Zheng’s brother goes to Macau to buy the other half of the map from his friend’s descendants, having sent his niece Shufen (Liu Qing) and son (Ba Ke) to wait for him in Malaya with their half. But after a series of double- crossings and betrayals, Shufen and the boy set off to search for the treasure alone, with the Macau triads and the police in hot pursuit. At their moment of greatest danger in the jungle, the Taiwanese Tarzan (Gao Ming) swings onto the scene to save them.","popularity":0.141,"poster_path":"/uayeUJObNenApKmOl1Hw5e2Mb8C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78366,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tai Lien Film Company","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1965-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tarzan And The Treasure","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1674084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liu Ching","original_name":"Liu Ching","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/1CUQZqq88GBreuaCvfmM3ALvEBb.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Cheng Shu-Fan (Tenn Siok-Hun)","credit_id":"6082f5322da846006e3a2954","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1613911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ko Yu-Min","original_name":"Ko Yu-Min","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":"/TIgnx5DQlgt7AbwUpTbvbLJBrk.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Qian Hong-Jun (Tsinn Hong-Kun)","credit_id":"65e11d9f6c449c0186f9741d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hsu Tsui-Tai","original_name":"Hsu Tsui-Tai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Mei Lan / Zhang Yao (Tiong Lau)","credit_id":"6082f5c1126ec3003f257650","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pa Ke","original_name":"Pa Ke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Cheng You-Fu (Tenn Lu-Hok)","credit_id":"6082f5f4d35dea002716deee","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1179224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kao Ming","original_name":"Kao Ming","popularity":0.0989,"profile_path":"/yKZheTfdXjvi5gDmQqd785CNZaW.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Tai Sha (Tarzan)","credit_id":"6082fa46a0664500718f0989","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1674097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lai Te-Nan","original_name":"Lai Te-Nan","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Hsu Zhi-Cheng (Khoo Tsi-Sing)","credit_id":"60832d8d271671002a00e4db","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1674105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liang Che-fu","original_name":"Liang Che-fu","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6082ef8e9e45860040c16321","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064641,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wu Jia-Ju","original_name":"Wu Jia-Ju","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6082f2342da846003f148f4b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902963,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Xiao Zhou","original_name":"Xiao Zhou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6082f2b865e0a20057670ffc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064643,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Li Guo-bao","original_name":"Li Guo-bao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6082f292c439c00079462966","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3064640,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wang Jun","original_name":"Wang Jun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6082f222a0664500718efc68","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1735840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Su Chin-Lung","original_name":"Su Chin-Lung","popularity":0.0715,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6082f9c09e45860029545343","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1890182,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lai Kuo Tsai","original_name":"Lai Kuo Tsai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64046b53021cee0079d1f585","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15710256","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uayeUJObNenApKmOl1Hw5e2Mb8C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xMrtEkrMPA650iIxlW0zxp723VQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1452},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yR79zN9BjUXm1sFVyFqcJqZDhHL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Chinese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Mandarin\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"zh\", \"native_name\"=>\"Chinese\"}","note":"","release_date":"1965-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
