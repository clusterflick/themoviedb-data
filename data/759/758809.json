Along with several inhabitants of Knegsel, they have been supporting the Indian priest Christopher Bara and his poor community for the last forty years. Does Marieke want to continue this project? She hesitates and raises confrontational questions. Is something like this effective, or just self-interest? To get real answers, she looks up Bara himself.
