The transaction meets with repugnance from the girl. She was entirely contented with conditions, a child of nature, carefree. However, she finds her pleading of no avail, and so pretends to accept the situation. The trapper and Canadian go into the cabin to seal the bargain with a drink, and while inside the girl closes and fastens the door on them and makes her way through the woods to escape.","popularity":0.2328,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1908-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Woman's Way","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1176590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Gebhardt","original_name":"George Gebhardt","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/yUsuLBxrWP6wO152fkS8ssHTmIg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"A Woodsman","credit_id":"5f9abfb3079a970036454395","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Solter","original_name":"Harry Solter","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":"/2HWWlgqD4xYKZNwiSaD2BqPyAY2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"A Camper","credit_id":"5f9abfe537b3a900370d4cff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Arvidson","original_name":"Linda Arvidson","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/pxNBQP2W90PyV69sjH3CRvXL2O4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Camper's Wife","credit_id":"5f9ac0001fb94f00363d1d13","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1171949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Bernard","original_name":"Dorothy Bernard","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":"/Aw51i2Azw2IICVyS8zpZE0VqFf6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f9ac00e37b3a900370d4d0a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur V.
