This place-based fabulation grounded in the valley of Oaxaca, Mexico, bastardizes Mesoamerican myths around four figures: a Hill, an Agave, an Opossum and Lady Reed. Lady Reed is a mythical Mixtec character who helps the opossum to cut the agave leaves in order to get its sugary alcoholic sap. Opossum Resilience overlaps the time of creation with a contemporary socio-environmental conflict around the imposition of a mining project in an Indigenous Territory. It summons the powers of festivity and inhebriation; and imagines an opossum providing an activist with the mythical powers to play dead and then revive.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Opossum Resilience","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2834739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naomi Rincón Gallardo","original_name":"Naomi Rincón Gallardo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9a45206eecee00368e9bb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
