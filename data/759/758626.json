Brought to light when the victims were in their fifties, these scandals sparked shock and indignation in the media and the public. Why have affected communities chosen secrecy over justice and truth for so long? Taking advantage of their influence to impose a \"pious silence\" on their parishioners, several figures of authority have built a veritable structure of abuse that testifies as much to the oppressions specific to the Acadian populations as to the systemic denial of the Catholic Church. Challenged by the power of collective silence, seasoned filmmaker Renée Blanchar seeks to unravel the root causes by going out to meet the survivors.","popularity":0.3409,"poster_path":"/kH56CvkMTP2UksiaVWXyOKaSbRg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":97450,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ça tourne production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le silence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renée Blanchar","original_name":"Renée Blanchar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9ab8286eecee0037908d39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421900,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Elric Robichon","original_name":"Elric Robichon","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9ae3cd87ae7b0036e21dc7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1925111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renée Blanchar","original_name":"Renée Blanchar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9ae4089a9f9a003654e3ce","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1294674,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sylvain Bellemare","original_name":"Sylvain Bellemare","popularity":0.2918,"profile_path":"/kGsqhWsy3TP92U5widUlBgUkLV4.jpg","credit_id":"5f9ae3f366565a0037bbd41f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2835182,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-François Mallet","original_name":"Jean-François Mallet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9ae3e317c4430038349e15","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150159,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Philippe Lavalette","original_name":"Philippe Lavalette","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/dYLlO9plY6MFeDkls8FPl4uQZS8.jpg","credit_id":"5fb67a599ae6130040a48441","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kH56CvkMTP2UksiaVWXyOKaSbRg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":803}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8782,"name":"pedophile priest"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"French\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"French\"}","note":"Digital because of COVID-19","release_date":"2020-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
