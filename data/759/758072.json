Twelve individual stages from Warsaw via Berlin to Prague had to be mastered. The total length was 2135 kilometres, and for the first time the Peace Journey was also held on GDR soil. The individual stages are reported with gripping film shots, short portraits of the cities and regions complete the itinerary. Exciting duels, crashes, winners, but also enthusiastic spectators and cheering workers at the roadsides show the sport from different perspectives. Intermediate cuts and reviews of the expansion and reconstruction of the cities of Warsaw, Berlin and Dresden are also part of this documentary film, as is a critical report on Bloody Sunday in Essen and the police's action against opponents of rearmament in West Germany.","popularity":0.1552,"poster_path":"/6wpyAP3hhLiS89kBV0qiP6w98lo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wytwórnia Filmów Dokumentalnych","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1952-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peace Race 1952","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joris Ivens","original_name":"Joris Ivens","popularity":0.2496,"profile_path":"/fNUOfmwxX37zV05kkbK4EFSrAfY.jpg","credit_id":"5f9895ee04863800352072d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0045341","wikidata_id":"Q8040501","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6wpyAP3hhLiS89kBV0qiP6w98lo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
