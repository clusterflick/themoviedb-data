At the same time, it is a story about a person's great sacrifices and the stubborn struggle to maintain a lifestyle and culture that are irrevocably about to disappear. Rune has chosen to stay out of EU regulations. He refuses to fill out forms and refuses to mark his cows with yellow plastic markings in their ears. Therefore, he cannot even deliver his milk to the dairy. Some of the milk is given to the calves, but most of it ends up in the manure pile. Thousands of litres of milk are thrown away every year.","popularity":0.159,"poster_path":"/tfhrVuFFbGOuBNriQI5l65RqAvM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Happy Cow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"The Happy Cow","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633186,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Per-Ove Högnäs","original_name":"Per-Ove Högnäs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9b4b0b66a7c300389849d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2835881,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Erik Petersen","original_name":"Erik Petersen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9b4b39aad9c20038d79b40","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2451,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tfhrVuFFbGOuBNriQI5l65RqAvM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1634}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":209732,"name":"Åland islands"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Swedish\", \"english_name\"=>\"Swedish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"sv\", \"native_name\"=>\"Swedish\"}","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
