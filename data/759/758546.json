They are the main characters of this film, which their student Viktor Kossakovsky shot during Pavel Kogan’s final months. For Lyudmila Stanukinas, Lyalya, as those close to her called her, her husband was her only reason for existence. She was with him until the end and held onto his extinguishing life as much as she could.","popularity":0.1678,"poster_path":"/n4Pm1jYgtZTovVMng0BV3NogVcX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pavel and Lyalya (A Jerusalem Romance)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Pavel i Lyalya","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":998555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Kossakovsky","original_name":"Viktor Kossakovsky","popularity":0.2324,"profile_path":"/aSRVvSwcyQK1EIffAkRSn0BEitB.jpg","credit_id":"5f9a4c8420af770037788a2f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":998555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Kossakovsky","original_name":"Viktor Kossakovsky","popularity":0.2324,"profile_path":"/aSRVvSwcyQK1EIffAkRSn0BEitB.jpg","credit_id":"5f9a4c7aa5046e0038849a2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0177970","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n4Pm1jYgtZTovVMng0BV3NogVcX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
