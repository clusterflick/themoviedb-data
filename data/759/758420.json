Noise musician known for his insane, mind-blowing noise performances. An artist and inventor who creates completely unpredictable synthesizers, each of which is a unique object of art. Surprisingly, it is the USSR that is the birthplace of industrial music. Back in the 1920s, Dziga Vertov recorded musical compositions from the sounds of a sawmill, and Arseny Avraamov created a symphony entirely consisting of the sounds of the city: factory whistles, whistling steam and the sounds of aircraft. With this film, we want to introduce to the world a modern representative of a century-old underground tradition who has dedicated his life to noise, performance and synthesis.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/rWieqxW0kHkMcnWu8BjuCEE2ApO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Papa Srapa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2834320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Konstantin Ivanov","original_name":"Konstantin Ivanov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f99e734aad9c20037d4d00c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2834332,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Damir Khalilov","original_name":"Damir Khalilov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f99e7d866565a0037b8c85f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2834324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikita Kabardin","original_name":"Nikita Kabardin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f99e783b4a5430039356d71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15724292","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"papa_srapa","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rWieqxW0kHkMcnWu8BjuCEE2ApO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1061}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2020-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Papa Srapa: Official Movie Teaser","key":"PNkK0AJ7MXE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-03-05T15:36:19.000Z","id":"5f99e81baad9c20038d4b63c"}]}}}
