While examining the meaning of health, disease, and well-being in the post-industrial world, Apple Grown In Wind Tunnel imagines the development of a culture at the margins, linked by illicit radio broadcasts, toxic waste sites, the highway, and ultimately by the overwhelming desire to find a cure.  \"To the immune system in the 21st Century, here's a sublime video elegy: a tale of illness, and grass-roots conjuring against the contemporary malaise. This riveting toxic-road-movie seeps and slouches forward in search of a cure.\"  â€”Craig Baldwin","popularity":0.0662,"poster_path":"/dR19j3lrb46Q26EgFS3Fx4YbJwp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apple Grown in Wind Tunnel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2833233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Matheson","original_name":"Steven Matheson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f98cceb9a9f9a00367c5001","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dR19j3lrb46Q26EgFS3Fx4YbJwp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
