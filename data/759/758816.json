They lovingly look after each other; cook, eat and bathe together; care for their skin and talk a lot. Camila quickly realises that there is more that binds them together than mere kinship: a curse is said to have been cast on the women in the family, causing unhappiness in their relationships. This belief is convenient, given that Camila longs for nothing more than her parents’ separation.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/tBZcGstJF8Mtl0QV0TaGSWoHWk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117883,"logo_path":"/mbpBAWpMTiAW8rNZ2h9IDSuPXTs.png","name":"Estúdio Giz","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":222543,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2020-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Longing Souls","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2835784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Fernanda Puyo","original_name":"María Fernanda Puyo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f9b38df6332f700388471dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2835786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lílla Códoba","original_name":"Lílla Códoba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f9b38eb6332f7003783ef30","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3311416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ingrid Perez","original_name":"Ingrid Perez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61933be8498bc200938c265f","department":"Directing","job":"Script Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2835788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Montenegro García","original_name":"Diana Montenegro García","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9b38fd6eecee00368fe738","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2835788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Montenegro García","original_name":"Diana Montenegro García","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9b390d39b6c300352e46ad","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2835788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Montenegro García","original_name":"Diana Montenegro García","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9b39199a9f9a0036555f2e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2835791,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Orlando Culzat","original_name":"Orlando Culzat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9b392d87ae7b0035e40a4a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2835795,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aline Mazarella","original_name":"Aline Mazarella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9b394266565a0036bb9b05","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2449279,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matheus Peçanha","original_name":"Matheus Peçanha","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9b395517c4430036344f9f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2449281,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thiago Yamachita","original_name":"Thiago Yamachita","popularity":0.1119,"profile_path":"/m83aD0XtKmuREzbzQWHVrz3bjPO.jpg","credit_id":"5f9b396266565a0034bc113f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2835799,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Andrés Morales","original_name":"Andrés Morales","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9b3978b4a543003838ef0a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13804322","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":823,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tBZcGstJF8Mtl0QV0TaGSWoHWk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kyiv International Film Festival «Molodist»","release_date":"2021-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
