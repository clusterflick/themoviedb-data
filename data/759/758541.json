We are all there, scrambling out of the cinema form and once again slipping away to there. The collage method of gluing us together: a mutating, holding, non-solidifying form of people. We refuse to panic. It is difficult for us to maintain a critical distance from the intimate, extracted, and repackaged in relation to other material.  Film as a message, film as a community, film as a form of interaction at a distance. We are led by Zhuzha, devices, and touch, which we were so lacking in quarantine.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":142739,"logo_path":null,"name":"Queer-feminist affinity art group “Unwanted Organisation”","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"flatness surface mutation shift: i hand out flesh to you, you will manage it","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
