They also study wild animals to create environments, activities, and educational programs at Disney's Animal Kingdom that are tailored to the species' physical and behavioral adaptations. How do naked mole rats identify family members, and why is the toilet chamber so important? How do dolphins identify each other in murky water? How do meerkats communicate it's safe to come out and forage for food? They all rely on communication adaptations - olfactory, auditory and visual. Students will learn to define and identify key adaptations, and listen in on amazing elephant communications that most humans have never heard.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/uZ115BQTetJgQhWPV4e9es2I5tI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Science of Disney Imagineering: Animal Adaptations - Communication","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3603676","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1498,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uZ115BQTetJgQhWPV4e9es2I5tI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":999}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
