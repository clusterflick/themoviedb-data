Since ancient times, people lived here. They were not afraid of the long polar night, nor of the winter blizzards and storms, nor of the barrenness of the stony earth and sand. Only by sea it was possible to reach Teriberskaya Bay, where the first artels of Pomor fishermen settled on the sandy shore. At the beginning of the 21st century, Teriberka lost its status as a regional center, turning into a dying village with a surreal landscape. The taciturn inhabitants remained devoted to their native Land, which is divided and sold behind their backs, evicted from their homes and deprived of fishing. But the sea gives them inner freedom. Without looking back.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Between Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3046587,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anastasiya Malhazova","original_name":"Anastasiya Malhazova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6071f2f42f7915003fc25783","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
