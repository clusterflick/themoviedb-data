Most of the characters in the film, which was shot for 4 years, suffered from imperfect laws or due to failures of the judicial system. The movie is about how difficult it is to wait and fight when there is nothing to hope for. About salvation by love. \"After all, not only those who are in prison are sitting-their loved ones are sitting with them!\" - says one of the heroines of the film, journalist Olga Romanova.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Russia Imprisoned","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2181051,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arkady Kogan","original_name":"Arkady Kogan","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/oOfd2ldda325OswHhXqlSd6m1UV.jpg","credit_id":"6072ecf97776f0006dc49fcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
