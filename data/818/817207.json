Since ancient times, only Evenks and reindeer herds roamed here. Civilization came here only in the middle of the twentieth century-for the first Soviet uranium, which was extracted by the Borlag prisoners, and for the copper of the unique Udokan deposit... But what brought our contemporaries-the heroes of this film-here? Who are they? What trials, sins, and memories do each of them bear? What do they (and any of us) have?) A mission?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mission","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1461766,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aleksandr Sveshnikov","original_name":"Aleksandr Sveshnikov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6072cae52a210c00402fb384","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
