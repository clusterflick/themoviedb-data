The camera gazes at the spaces in-between image and text, photography and memory, body and place. The surface texture of the film, like the land north of Lake Superior, is overdetermined by the discourse of territorialism, the cultural divisions of space and place framed and divided amid the ruins of history. An irritating buzz overlays parts of the soundtrack, signifying the hydro-electric development that has irreparably disrupted life in the north, while at the same time extending a modicum of material benefits. The filmmakers understand themselves as embodying this southern technocracy, and choose to turn the camera onto their own presence and progress of looking. Here, they work against the tendency, present since the days of Flaherty and in his more recent imitators, to objectify Aboriginal peoples within an unnameable (and thus exploitable) landscape.ï»¿","popularity":0.0347,"poster_path":"/kfnrLxAGI1MiJMiGHw1HaBg3Kud.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33385,"logo_path":"/mwYzhJn7rRNr6cb695jJET72EoT.png","name":"Illume","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1995-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweep","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1762178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sami van Ingen","original_name":"Sami van Ingen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607390737c6de30056c06bca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1762178,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sami van Ingen","original_name":"Sami van Ingen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6169ee695a991500447f4a2c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":171172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Hoffman","original_name":"Philip Hoffman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6169edb381c7be0043aa4694","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":171172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Hoffman","original_name":"Philip Hoffman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6169ee6179b3d40064c02ff5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":992,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kfnrLxAGI1MiJMiGHw1HaBg3Kud.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":668}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
