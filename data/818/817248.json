Father Kara was showered with honours for regularly exceeding expectations. For his son Boris and his daughter Marina, though, those days are just a memory. Unemployment is now rife in the entire region and worries are drowned with vodka. Marina sets up a small private bakery, baking day and night to ensure the family survives. When debris from a Proton M rocket crash-lands on the mountain pasture, narrowly missing the cabin, Boris and Marina demand a large sum of compensation money from the Russian space agency Roscosmos. Their claims remain unanswered and instead of the much-hoped-for improvement in their lives, the family is beset by more disaster.","popularity":0.0962,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free Fall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3047700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Syuzanna Shyule","original_name":"Syuzanna Shyule","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6072e7961da7a60058999f1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3047702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elena Levina","original_name":"Elena Levina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6072e7a07776f000580f59ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
