Small personal events and ordinary technology alternate. Subjects like a digital clock, a laundromat, a recorder and a filmclip promoting an electronics factory are experienced just as subjectively as walking through a cornfield or living in a dormitory. On one page of this visual diary is a musical improvisation - one of the artists plays the trumpet for the first time; on another, pieces of a TV show. This romanticism of the technological society is borne not only by impulsively chosen and reworked pictures, but especially by its own electronic music. The initial title of (a part of) the work has been 'In the Interest of Science and Technology'.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3ER7RZivHGQTP7nr5plpE1J594B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Konjunkturkunst","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3049460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Auto Awac","original_name":"Auto Awac","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60746fb02faf4d004191e9e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ER7RZivHGQTP7nr5plpE1J594B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
