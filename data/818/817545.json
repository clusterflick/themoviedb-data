Jatin and his family feel an uncanny attachment to the feathered friends who are almost their own children. But the world beyond the Mahato family is not so friendly to the birds. Over the years they are being mercilessly killed for their tasty flesh. Jatin has severely beaten up several times and the villagers have ostracized the family. But the morale of the Mahato family is too high. They guard the birds day and night so that no one can do any harm to them.","popularity":0.0534,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2000-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Supriyo Sen","original_name":"Supriyo Sen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6074021ed4b9d90058cb08e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1658622,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Debkanta Chakraborty","original_name":"Debkanta Chakraborty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6074027065686e0057f2eecc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Supriyo Sen","original_name":"Supriyo Sen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6074023f4d0e8d005a3217d6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1658229,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Premendu Bikash Chaki","original_name":"Premendu Bikash Chaki","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/A1KUvZwvB0xnEmYTN8lqSu482ni.jpg","credit_id":"607402564e4dff006ec48607","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2267703,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Abdul Rajjak","original_name":"Abdul Rajjak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6074026365686e007820852f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3049049,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kanishka Sarkar","original_name":"Kanishka Sarkar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6074027efb834600578e03ef","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3049047,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sumit Maitra","original_name":"Sumit Maitra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607402358ddc3400292b356f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
