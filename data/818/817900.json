The influence of British documentary tradition - as well as the films of directors like Joris Ivens or Georges Franju - is evident in Fishermen in Jaffa. In a carefully-planned frail structure of narrative, the film progresses from daylight to night. In it Perlov creates at the same time a vast, panoramic view, and an intimate, private one - whether he films a lone cat wandering on the dock, or the glowing faces of the fishermen. This early film already depicts Perlov's unique style.","popularity":0.0889,"poster_path":"/6hd0ZomWVVuzSIQdEUZq95pbg6I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fisherman In Jaffa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Perlov","original_name":"David Perlov","popularity":0.1109,"profile_path":"/oXFHsE3rCXg7rNIobA9aSLwHthQ.jpg","credit_id":"60756baa2faf4d002aaca11b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1616,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6hd0ZomWVVuzSIQdEUZq95pbg6I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1077}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
