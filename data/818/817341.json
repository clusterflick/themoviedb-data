Ronit Balaban runs the family hothouse which exports plants to Europe. She is capable, strong and determined. While her country is in the midst of disengaging from the region she calls home - her husband had already disengaged from life many years before. Yaakov was the victim of a terror attack which left him disfigured. His inability to cope with his deformity has made him withdrawn and remote. This inspired documentary is the story of one strong woman who struggles to keep her family, her marriage and above all - her hothouse working and flourishing.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":204509,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alafim productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2009-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hothouse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"חממה - משפחה בהתנתקות","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Hamama","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3048062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Idit Gan-zvi","original_name":"Idit Gan-zvi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607319d67c6de30056bfb42e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3048065,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tamar Gan-Zvi","original_name":"Tamar Gan-Zvi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60731a1d4d0e8d004304d758","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073626,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Bar-Giora","original_name":"Jonathan Bar-Giora","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b96e7c3009aa00c5b780d2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2528594","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/og7DU0LuBSaIakVb5IoDMgo87Gc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
