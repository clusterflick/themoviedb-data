With a punk sensibility and soundtrack, the artist conveys being trapped in an emotionally abusive relationship while living in a culture bent on celebration and positive images. Mainstream queer culture and queer media are loathe to discuss any dirty little secrets under the rainbow. Rancour dares to explore the interrelations between fear, shame, complicity, rage, silence, hatred, and romantic love.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":151906,"logo_path":"/991or5W5BkAja7wzmB4Fh3nkfhp.png","name":"Out On Screen","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2000-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rancour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3017043,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Earl Moloney","original_name":"Earl Moloney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6073d666ca8354006fbdf25f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
