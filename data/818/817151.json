Actually, it's simple...simple machines, that is! Here, the Imagineers give a new look at how levers and pulleys were utilized to create attractions such as Dumbo the Flying Elephant and Soarin' Over California. Students will see how levers and pulleys make work easier by either multiplying or redirecting the effort we put into them. They will identify the two forces involved in using a machine and learn to calculate mechanical advantage, given effort and resistance.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":"/asWtxEbow1nOIyUf9Gy3nWydiFX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Science of Disney Imagineering: Levers and Pulleys","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3603606","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1498,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/asWtxEbow1nOIyUf9Gy3nWydiFX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":999}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
