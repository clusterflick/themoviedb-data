Unnecessary, superfluous, idiotic-so unflattering Andrey speaks about himself. However, all 30 years of his life could be the script of a feature film. Having escaped from a mental hospital, in which he was locked up with a lifelong diagnosis of \"incapacity\", he ended up in a large – scale madhouse-the capital. Without documents and a roof over his head, Andrey is looking for ways to regain his right to a free life. Now his route is official offices and endless psychiatric examinations. The goal is to return the legal capacity.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/wIvCMXyHwh8qShkZDJ2xOQRhUU0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89933,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinoteatr.Doc","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Idiot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1810911,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mikhail Sinev","original_name":"Михаил Синёв","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60747337d4b9d90027d11059","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2045774,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Svetlana Strelnikova","original_name":"Svetlana Strelnikova","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/xPv3wiiCTMCxZeq7UIwOXL81PN8.jpg","credit_id":"6074734c78570e004016fafe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2045774,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Svetlana Strelnikova","original_name":"Svetlana Strelnikova","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/xPv3wiiCTMCxZeq7UIwOXL81PN8.jpg","credit_id":"607473584d0e8d0043069c99","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2034222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Panasenko","original_name":"Юлия Панасенко","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/buWCuMecr3VbPG1AIl72qGkVl4n.jpg","credit_id":"6074731dd4b9d90040d9a69f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2045774,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Svetlana Strelnikova","original_name":"Svetlana Strelnikova","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/xPv3wiiCTMCxZeq7UIwOXL81PN8.jpg","credit_id":"607473292a09bc00578da6a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2034222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuliya Panasenko","original_name":"Юлия Панасенко","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/buWCuMecr3VbPG1AIl72qGkVl4n.jpg","credit_id":"607473622faf4d0058dbad6e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wIvCMXyHwh8qShkZDJ2xOQRhUU0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Идиот | Трейлер | Премия Лавр-2007","key":"QhkU2iKvFtI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-08-16T06:41:28.000Z","id":"607473b878570e006e355f1b"}]}}}
