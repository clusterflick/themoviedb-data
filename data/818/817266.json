Space falls apart into a slow flow of inner paths – a thick and lifeless stream on which the body tries to lean – which can be unraveled and renamed only by the pounding of the editing. An embryonic state, an archaic body thrust into the night silence of the film, dwelling with its blind nudity in the mysterious depth of the bottomless waters.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Petit Enfer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raphaël Sevet","original_name":"Raphaël Sevet","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6072f0b77776f0006dc4a264","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
