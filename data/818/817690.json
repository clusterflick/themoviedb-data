Bill Traylor was born into slavery in 1853 on a cotton plantation in rural Alabama. After the Civil War, Traylor continued to farm the land as a sharecropper until the late 1920s. Aging and alone, he moved to Montgomery and worked odd jobs in the thriving segregated black neighborhood. A decade later, in his late 80s, Traylor became homeless and started to draw and paint, both memories from plantation days and scenes of a radically changing urban culture.  He made well over a thousand drawings and paintings between 1939-1942. This colorful, strikingly modernist work eventually led him to be recognized as one of Americaâ€™s greatest self-taught artists and the subject of a Smithsonian retrospective.","popularity":0.1242,"poster_path":"/zicBvV2YsULYhc9UpBw5swTKYGJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-04-16","revenue":4504,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bill Traylor: Chasing Ghosts","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52056,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jeffrey Wolf","original_name":"Jeffrey Wolf","popularity":0.1757,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607484157776f0003f5d84c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1641162,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eliott Taylor","original_name":"Eliott Taylor","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/3RbDyL42fRLBiJd8c6H9LjNDGGZ.jpg","credit_id":"65d5623f0e4fc8018684893a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9108510","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zicBvV2YsULYhc9UpBw5swTKYGJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1175},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dQCgdcyZKgbWBXXgjkAgxFXX9N3.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
