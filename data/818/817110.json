She is slowly dying of a disease for which her doctor seems unable or unwilling to find a cause or a cure. Roderick begs an old friend to visit. Shortly after the friend’s arrival,  Madeline is found dead and is buried in a vault beneath the house. In an attempt to calm the increasingly distracted Roderick, his friend reads to him a medieval romance. As the climax of the tale is reached, the figure of Madeline appears—she has been buried alive and has clawed her way out of the vault to find her brother. Roderick is overcome by horror and as he and Madeline both confront death, the House of Usher  collapses around them","popularity":0.0322,"poster_path":"/tIM5cslbtzxjDvjJ4P3BvTCNotd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fall of the House of Usher: Usher House / La Chute De La Maison Usher - San Francisco Opera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3047084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Mulligan","original_name":"Brian Mulligan","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Roderick Usher","credit_id":"607261eaecc7e80029d7b0a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2713654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline Piccolino","original_name":"Jacqueline Piccolino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Madeline Usher","credit_id":"6072622666565a004099343c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2428768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Bridges","original_name":"Jason Bridges","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Edgar Allan Poe","credit_id":"6072624d4b9bae003f204fa3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3047085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Reed","original_name":"Anthony Reed","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Doctor Primus","credit_id":"6072628078570e004014800e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3047088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamielyn Duggan","original_name":"Jamielyn Duggan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Madeline Usher (dancer)","credit_id":"607262ceca835400408b44b1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel Sorensen","original_name":"Joel Sorensen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Le Médecin","credit_id":"607263014b9bae00578ddd7d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3047092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Nelson","original_name":"Edward Nelson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"L’Ami","credit_id":"6072632a2fe2fa0057269155","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Zamacona","original_name":"Frank Zamacona","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607261a578570e0040147e38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1704,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tIM5cslbtzxjDvjJ4P3BvTCNotd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1136}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
