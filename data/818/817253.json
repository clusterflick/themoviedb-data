So, scientists have launched an experiment - a person has the opportunity to abandon the existence in the body, to become digital by translating into a hologram. It is impossible to return back to the body. A holographic person still has memory, consciousness, sight, hearing, and the ability to speak. Ordinary people see holograms without special devices and can come into contact with them... A new technology that changes the existence of man. Evolution or another form of escape? This is what some of those who have already become a hologram are trying to understand.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I am a Hologram","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3047731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kseniya Galkina","original_name":"Kseniya Galkina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6072eb331da7a60077390f11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
