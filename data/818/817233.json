The people who came to work on this steamer became a unique crew in their own way. Many of them worked as a team for a very long time - both ten and fifteen years. This was a rare case in the Sakhalin Shipping Company-with an endless staff turnover. \"Anton Buyukly\" has become for many sailors not just a place of work, but a real home. And the crew members of this ship remained loyal friends for life.","popularity":0.0693,"poster_path":"/xGXXgbCNIDNKUZlHaZW09AsehAa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father's Ship","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":127123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oksana Bychkova","original_name":"Oksana Bychkova","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/2OOZK90q6zUsYlR2Lvfqgwhac56.jpg","credit_id":"6072e1e3d4b9d900791faed0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xGXXgbCNIDNKUZlHaZW09AsehAa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
