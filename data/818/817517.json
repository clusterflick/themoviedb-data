It narrates the journey and unforgettable experience of three young beatboxers as they travel from Yan Bian to Beijing and Shanghai to support one of the worldÂ’s top beatboxers, Killa Kela. Yan Bian is the capital of beatboxing in China. This relatively small city has a vibrant creative culture, where beatboxing, DJing, breaking and other forms of hip-hop thrive. While the main sounds are drum-beats, the masters can add a range of other sounds until a magical and unbelievable effect is created. Born in the 70s in New York, beatbox arrived in Yan Bian via the internet. Led by Gui Jing, the film shows how creative culture can emerge and grow in the most unexpected places and reveals the energy, curiosity and innovation of ChinaÂ’s youth.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4V4hUzHAVrVP70oNvBA8z6ztZqF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"YB BOX","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"YBBOX","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3048999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liu Feng","original_name":"Liu Feng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6073ef604e4dff00401d7b91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1632696","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1276,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4V4hUzHAVrVP70oNvBA8z6ztZqF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":850}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The trailer of the 1st Chinese beatbox documentary","key":"jhiMeHDAJmQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2007-03-05T15:09:46.000Z","id":"6073ea2ed29bdd004034f2ce"}]}}}
