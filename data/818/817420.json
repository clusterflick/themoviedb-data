Adventurer Jonas Deichmann, multiple ultracycling world record holder, teams up with ultra cyclist and photographer Philipp Hympendahl. When they set off, the current record for the Cape to Cape challenge stands at 102 days. This 18,000 km long bicycle ride is self-supported, so they have to pack light and stay on the move. Jonas and Philipp want to crush the record by more than 30 days. This means riding 250 km every day, no rest days allowed.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3qT71MkVteEKppUkrtkp0h4OA3O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"18.000KM Ultracycling Challenge","title":"Cape To Cape","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3qT71MkVteEKppUkrtkp0h4OA3O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
