Then a ferry carrying fifteen boarding students sank in the Ili River. Three drowned. But twelve were saved-thanks to the young driver of the state farm Bisetai Daurenbekov… This film is about saved children. More precisely, already adults. About how their fates turned out. Some still live on the banks of the Ili - they will tell about themselves, about others, and about Bisetai.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2016-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyssetay Daurenbekov and 12 Fates","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Бисетай Дауренбеков и 12 судеб","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3047875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kayrat Kuanyshbaev","original_name":"Kayrat Kuanyshbaev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6073073b7c6de30029682485","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
