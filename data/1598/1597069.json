David delighted Breer at the “Pep” with antics such as letting a costumed cockroach out of a jar to run across the bar at 3am. Amused, Sophie rented a Betamax camera to create the film Waje’s Cockabunnies. Shot in the style of the mid-century children’s show Romper Room, Sophie's 14-minute video features David attaching bunny ears and cottontails to cockroaches he found in his apartment.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cockabunnies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1143741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Wojnarowicz","original_name":"David Wojnarowicz","popularity":0.5942,"profile_path":"/aUujpjc3jDZOdQSWnB4ZVmtjaBx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693b7cec2985b40055360931","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5872858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Breer","original_name":"Emily Breer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693b7d7b2da9fa1f716ec24e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5872861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Baillie","original_name":"David Baillie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693b7db4aaf481531336095e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5872844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Breer","original_name":"Sophie Breer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693b7dc2d3453d9df2c3bbca","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5872844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Breer","original_name":"Sophie Breer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693b7c3545808b8ed63609bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
