The CEO of the law firm where he worked, Keller, was suspected of embezzling the client's inheritance. Keller bribed the witness, Carolyn, to give false testimony and was acquitted. The media portrayed Bandaley as a person who used the Whistleblower Act to blackmail his employer. Besides being unemployed, Bandaley also suffered from a rare mental illness: word substitution disorder. He couldn't talk to people using the correct vocabulary and even spoke foul language, so he began to avoid contact with anyone. One day, Carolyn was suddenly killed. Her ex-husband presumed that she was silenced for giving false testimony. If it was confirmed that the judgment back then was a miscarriage of justice, it could not only clear Bandaley's name but also convict Keller. Bandaley had to take the witness stand that he feared the most again and be interrogated repeatedly under the watchful eyes of the media and the public.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/qodmuYh1sPf2YPNmGUhUvqVc1Vd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reputation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35668973","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":1432,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qodmuYh1sPf2YPNmGUhUvqVc1Vd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":976}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
