The footage, taken from a 1988 anti-drug presidential address by both Ronald and Nancy Reagan, has been reedited to suggest the inauguration of a pro-drug campaign in the United States. This humorous mashup attempts to undermine the US government's scare tactics, and serves as a poignant critique of the disastrous Reagan-initiated War on Drugs that has left hundreds of thousands of nonviolent offenders languishing in prisons all over the United States.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6QH767kUeqFLbZc6GED6NW9yEGT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Reagans Speak Out on Drugs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5873163,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cliff Roth","original_name":"Cliff Roth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693b9742fd3190d994cafe83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6QH767kUeqFLbZc6GED6NW9yEGT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
