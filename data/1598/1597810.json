He offers her roses, only to have them immediately rejected. What follows is a series of absurd, slapstick-inspired events—breaking a decorative bust, accidentally putting a fish in the June’s drink—that culminate in Cal posing shirtless on her indoor “beach” set, sparking June's creative epiphany and leading her to photograph him for a Vogue ad campaign. This short film was created in 1987 under the mentorship of Martin Scorsese while Gruber was a student at Columbia Film School, and has since earned a place in exhibitions at New York’s MoMA, cementing its status as a noteworthy artistic work.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/b1tu0vt0qFUq0aQqA8i5Pgx7xIk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174182,"logo_path":"/ld9DG6awoPjjYmwDwx0sxzHuFq8.png","name":"Columbia University School of
