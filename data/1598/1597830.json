This show is full of cool one-of-a-kind performances, and is an upgrade over what has previously circulated of this show. The stage was well lit for the video and the cameras are mostly steady. There was a lot of flash photography that washes out frames here and there, but it's mostly problem free and quite enjoyable.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mI1oHK4wN8DYiMyrw4vLm95y4rC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":263324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Swingin' Pig","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elvis Costello & Friends Live at Sweetwater","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elvis Costello","original_name":"Elvis Costello","popularity":0.58,"profile_path":"/mYg00svLkVJlxEAiiyaOSHUz8nl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"693d9a26169ea06e749992f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Garcia","original_name":"Jerry Garcia","popularity":0.3049,"profile_path":"/6jAKLIekOs6FFcc783PZ1pb8soe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"693d9a33a4d1e319d0aec8fd","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mI1oHK4wN8DYiMyrw4vLm95y4rC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1989-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
