The defiant attitude of Mihai Stănescu, known at the time for his caricatures with political allusions, also appears to have a mischievous dimension.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antinterview","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","title":"Antiinterviu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62507,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Mihai Stanescu","original_name":"Mihai Stanescu","popularity":0.2274,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693d36f58c698601d4619d39","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5875207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tudor Potra","original_name":"Tudor Potra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693d36e7c6e89d4bc95dfaea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
