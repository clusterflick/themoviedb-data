Creativity was encouraged, often within the framework of a specific project. For example, a visit to the Lincoln Park Zoo might inspire the design and construction of figures of animals, as shown in the film. Or a visit to the Shedd Aquarium would result in the construction of rattan and cellophane fishes. The culmination of a project was the bringing together of the children and their creations in a performance, such as the AQUARIUM PLAY shown at the end of the film, which featured reflected colored forms and shadows.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1940-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children's Workshop","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"László Moholy-Nagy","original_name":"László Moholy-Nagy","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693db0be38b481c9f683e629","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1940-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
