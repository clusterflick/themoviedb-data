Through fragments, we follow him and the people he encounters throughout the day, accompanied by conversations about the city with his wife in broken Thai. The snow falls as light as ashes, a woman puts the trot up in a crane, a deaf class draws the city, a young man raps as fast as he can and an old friend pitches on the street. Stockholm: a magical city, a tragic city.","popularity":0.2152,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sky City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3379583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Viksten Abrahamsson","original_name":"Joel Viksten Abrahamsson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67854f84bd793c03544ed721","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
