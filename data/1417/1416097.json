It was here that she and her husband, the mayor of St. Mere Eglise, witnessed so many American soldiers giving their lives to protect freedom and democracy. Their small town became these soldiers' final resting place and Madame Renaud spent a lifetime tending to their graves and corresponding with their loved ones back home. She became a friend, family and touchstone to those whose lives were forever changed on that day.","popularity":1.0805,"poster_path":"/6xTcpwyjsshfiU3stojAg2LiYQ0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101959,"logo_path":null,"name":"DesertRock
