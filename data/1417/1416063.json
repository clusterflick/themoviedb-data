While the project unfolds Alan balances his career with Great Big Sea, navigates through debilitating back problems, and attempts to find a record label home for his new project.  This liberating project has allowed Alan to step outside of the comfort zone of his day band and scratch some names off his musical bucket list. The names include icon Jim Cuddy of Blue Rodeo, indie legend Hawksley Workman, Robin Hood co-star Scott Grimes, Gordie Sampson, legendary television composer Mike Post, and Alans good friend and longtime musical partner, Russell Crowe.","popularity":0.6514,"poster_path":"/4IYvT3yIEPoMK5BC0DXjgBvZgcf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167393,"logo_path":null,"name":"Take The Shot
