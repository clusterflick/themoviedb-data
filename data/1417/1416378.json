Artist Quenton Miller portrays the life of this unique animal, a loyal comrade of Marshal Tito, leader of Yugoslavia for 35 years. A rich photographic archive relives the caged memories of this cockatoo, who had the honour of meeting Hollywood stars, and bloodthirsty dictators. A funny portrait, non-aligned with the documentary orthodoxy, that deals with the false constructions of history.","popularity":0.0946,"poster_path":"/7ab2HCntF491JzIX6EcNASORKb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249931,"logo_path":null,"name":"When Site Lost the Plot","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2025-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Koki, Ciao","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josip Broz Tito","original_name":"Josip Broz Tito","popularity":0.7042,"profile_path":"/fXXtFGdvsMWGRScqTLoQOHED4FN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6783b727136e157cf27b30ad","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5174528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quenton Miller","original_name":"Quenton Miller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6783b756ee84fa4def7b6504","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5174528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quenton Miller","original_name":"Quenton Miller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6783b763b9094c7dfebb038a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Misho Antadze","original_name":"Misho Antadze","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mAtptx5ic9OO0Vcrh6j9nmtO7qZ.jpg","credit_id":"6783b77778cfcd77ed4eb238","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5174528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quenton Miller","original_name":"Quenton Miller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6783b781ee84fa4def7b651e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5174528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Quenton Miller","original_name":"Quenton Miller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6783b790b9094c7dfebb03a3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Misho Antadze","original_name":"Misho Antadze","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mAtptx5ic9OO0Vcrh6j9nmtO7qZ.jpg","credit_id":"6783b7b9136e157cf27b30f8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2334042,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luka Barajević","original_name":"Luka Barajević","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6783b7c778cfcd77ed4eb282","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qt7MjhgZ1MDkSl54ctrcKfyncb1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wG7rAqn0BhEMuNQLSkyF7ErCswf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7ab2HCntF491JzIX6EcNASORKb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2025-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
