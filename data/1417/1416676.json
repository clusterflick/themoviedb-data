These jewel-like pieces do not add up to a plot. Even when something recurs – like the studio set that stands in for a nightclub, proudly stripped bare under the final credits – or a performer reappears in a different situation, it is not for the purposes of narrative linkage. The connections between tableaux come about in a different way: through an accumulated interweaving, threaded on music.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/fBQRbyDNrcjQiyOsW4dCYUPWKIK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hell is full of musical amateurs.","title":"La Cura","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Fagin","original_name":"Steve Fagin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67848fca8c2309ceafbb3c7b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fBQRbyDNrcjQiyOsW4dCYUPWKIK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":512}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
