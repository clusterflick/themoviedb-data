A training program places them in elderly care facilities in Pirna, a small town in eastern Germany.  “Why Germany, and why nursing?” the young Kyrgyz are asked when they apply for the program.  A German filmmaker travels between the countries and captures perceptions about Germany from afar, as well as attitudes of senior citizens from Pirna regarding the current care system. In both places, she meets people who are contemplating their future and growing old, who may one day cross paths in the small town of Pirna.","popularity":0.1944,"poster_path":"/qcEH0HdMKWVdBrYpGDYhgNcF0s4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":250055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media University of Applied Sciences Berlin (MA Visual Anthropology)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"KG","name":"Kyrgyz Republic"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Kirghiz","iso_639_1":"ky","name":"??????"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Germany\" -
