Doc Ball had a huge influence on promoting surfing world-wide during the 1930's and 1940's because of his over 900 photographs and thousands of feet of 16mm film that he shot in and out of the water. Doc retells the history of surfing in California as captured through his lens including personal remembrances of Tom Blake, Duke Kahanamoku, Pete Peterson, Whitey Harrison, The Palos Verdes Surfing Club and other top surfers and innovators of that pioneering time. Legendary surfer, shaper and filmmaker Greg Noll explains Doc's influence on surfing and his friendship with Doc Ball.
