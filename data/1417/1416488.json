Settled in the prehistoric times by Polynesian sailors, who by simple means captured the enormous expanse of the Pacific. Home to the wave of waves, which has developed from a cultic action to a popular sport and has an enormous cultural significance to this day. This film shows the whole impressive beauty of this exotic world in breathtaking aerial photographs and detailed close-ups.
