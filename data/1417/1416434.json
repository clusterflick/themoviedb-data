The documentary ‘Udo!’ shows the gripping profile of a restless man who, at the proud age of 80, still filled the halls on his ‘Mitten im Leben’ tour and conquered the audience. Udo Jürgens and his breathless biography: musical genius, heartthrob, dream dancer, self-doubter, a character with many facets. The entertainer balanced effortlessly between high gloss and depth. Previously unpublished material such as photos, letters, diary entries, tape recordings and private films provide exclusive insights into his dazzling life.","popularity":0.1198,"poster_path":"/cWitghKsrdmZM27VPfAqh6ILhyg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":203051,"logo_path":null,"name":"Constantin Dokumentation","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":82020,"logo_path":null,"name":"Final Frame","origin_country":""},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"UDO!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Udo Jürgens","original_name":"Udo Jürgens","popularity":0.503,"profile_path":"/gwxyPYHLbODoSsBxtO8M0Jsme7h.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6783d571136e157cf27b36c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1895186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Birnstiel","original_name":"Thomas Birnstiel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6790fd49bca8037dab28baa0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2095070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manfred Bockelmann","original_name":"Manfred Bockelmann","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6790fdc2297a5d91d07758dc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenny Jürgens","original_name":"Jenny Jürgens","popularity":0.1752,"profile_path":"/4jhcyQcjpNqAFbdk1tyg56C0lqm.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6790fdeaa3c7d79472e000c4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Jürgens","original_name":"John Jürgens","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6790fe08bca8037dab28bb44","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5196278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Panja Jürgens","original_name":"Panja Jürgens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6790fe75550e6fc3cde006f9","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastian Dehnhardt","original_name":"Sebastian Dehnhardt","popularity":0.0979,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6790fc8a2a7aff0c3b28b82a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sebastian Dehnhardt","original_name":"Sebastian Dehnhardt","popularity":0.0979,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6790fc9fbe9a9aa782775aa9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5196264,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Kunac","original_name":"David Kunac","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6790fcb6fc2519b43f775ff8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5196264,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Kunac","original_name":"David Kunac","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6790fcc5be9a9aa782775abe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1039919,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tobias Corts","original_name":"Tobias Corts","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6790fcfac9115c9e3d28b620","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5196267,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Philip Montasser","original_name":"Philip Montasser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6790fd7f2a7aff0c3b28b899","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1611,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sFvb0MEPALmlj1qTRiVgHcbJxqy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2864}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/cWitghKsrdmZM27VPfAqh6ILhyg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Das Erste","release_date":"2024-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
