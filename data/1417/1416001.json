He never lost the verve of this strange form of freedom, trapped in the cab and facing the varied itineraries of the world. Among the many jobs he held, he was also that of a filmmaker in Boca do Lixo, at a time when making films lacked pride and friends. He had both in abundance. His complexity can now be revisited in a process of image and sound collages, guided by a frank and reflective conversation, recorded at the end of 1997, about the cinema of yesterday, but also about today.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/bG9agWPMtU7pHlcoAfS4EnrSBLF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122465,"logo_path":null,"name":"DGT Filmes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2025-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"E do Nosso Também.","title":"Candeias: Um Ser do seu Tempo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ozualdo Ribeiro Candeias","original_name":"Ozualdo Ribeiro Candeias","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":"/o9VlecVKS4roDrZWAm5acE3xrMk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67829347136e157cf27b05f9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2659784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Well Darwin","original_name":"Well Darwin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/v5E66jTVaHkSPcSqrFcfogGsPLg.jpg","credit_id":"67829326601acfe7bd4ef498","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2659784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Well Darwin","original_name":"Well Darwin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/v5E66jTVaHkSPcSqrFcfogGsPLg.jpg","credit_id":"6782932d218fd57acf4ee2b4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2659784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Well Darwin","original_name":"Well Darwin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/v5E66jTVaHkSPcSqrFcfogGsPLg.jpg","credit_id":"67829335218fd57acf4ee2bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2659784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Well Darwin","original_name":"Well Darwin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/v5E66jTVaHkSPcSqrFcfogGsPLg.jpg","credit_id":"6782933b218fd57acf4ee2c0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.775,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/FHHBv7n0Ln7Vo08DJ5NFTDjWGB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AsfZuyFeinPh8pZJyI9AlecyqIs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/bG9agWPMtU7pHlcoAfS4EnrSBLF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"10","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"Mostra de Cinema de Tiradentes","release_date":"2025-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
