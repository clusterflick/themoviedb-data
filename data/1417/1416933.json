A sad, dark, cold and lonely place that is transformed into a magical space, thanks to the light of our heroine's soul. Alongside her live her guardians of the heart: a magician, a fairy, an angel and a jester: they help her, accompany her and give her strength when she feels lost. Her joy and her ability to feel and dream make Delfina, her sister, hate her, envy her and try to destroy her. Delfina has everything that can be bought with money and lacks everything that comes from the heart. Such is the strength of the soul of our “Princess of the Terrace” that she manages to reverse Delfina's superficial and frivolous world. In this terrace love arises, since Max, a writer who lives nearby, manages to see everything that happens in the house of the evil Delfina and in the dome of the sweet Flinderella. A new tale with a great love
