The poverty of peasants and poor Cossacks is opposed to the lavish lifestyle of the Ukrainian and Polish noblemen, priests, and Cossack officers. Cossacks fight off Tatars’ attacks, however, they start to realise that the real enemy is much closer. Taras Triasylo raises Cossacks to help the rebellious peasants.  A dramatic historical narrative, masterly mass shootings of horse attacks, hand-to-hand combats and public festivities contrast with lounge scenes in the palace – balls, feasts, and entertainment of rich people and their family members wearing brocade clothes. On a grand scale and with an eye for detail, the director draws the texture of the film and its characters. The leading actors of Les Kurbas’s theatre Berezil played film protagonists. The film based on Volodymyr Sosiura’s verse novel of 1925 was considered lost for a long time.","popularity":0.1923,"poster_path":"/hCGeTtdEsrI7iXhZMPQFI3crjEO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25065,"logo_path":"/ugfX3cgasxoDtUjkmWqlthK4hja.png","name":"VUFKU","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet
