And he sees this dream where the devil takes him to the palace of Catherine II in Saint-Petersburg; and there Vakula takes off the little shoes of the Russian empress to give them to his fiancée Oksana. And, really, drunk Vakula takes off the shoes while sleeping… but from Patsiuk. Later, when Vakula unwraps the package with the “royal slippers” in front of Oksana, he finds only Patsiuk’s dirty shoes there.","popularity":0.2552,"poster_path":"/28hT5Fm0jG7ap2qttd7UiUGYLRs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25065,"logo_path":"/ugfX3cgasxoDtUjkmWqlthK4hja.png","name":"VUFKU","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1928-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Little Shoes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Черевики","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Ночь перед рождеством","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3218491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Tsikhomovich","original_name":"Peter Tsikhomovich","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Vakula","credit_id":"612ece652cefc2008dc3a221","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3218492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Galina Galina","original_name":"G.
