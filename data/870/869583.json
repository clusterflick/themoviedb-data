The “feral house” of the poem is not a metaphor, it is the term for an abandoned house overtaken by foliage, a domicile lurking, covered, protected, masked, hidden, returned, and wild in a world that was not working. We will not be going back. The unmaking of the future has accelerated. Our entanglement is clearer than ever. Urgent memories of a world before our time, before our time keepers, appear with astonishing presence. They overtake what we thought was the future. It has no name yet, and is growing.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/c5HyEJKmWqLTLwOm32DBXA9vc3x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mouth is Still a Wild Door","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3219049,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guta Galli","original_name":"Guta Galli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612f994eb84cdd002cbbf46a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2739238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Lesley Selcer","original_name":"Anne Lesley Selcer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612f995fcffeed00202aeffc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1360,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c5HyEJKmWqLTLwOm32DBXA9vc3x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":907}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CROSSROADS","release_date":"2021-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
