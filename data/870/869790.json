One time Hui received a 1000 dollar bonus, and his colleague Zhu Ge-Kong paid a plan to hide the bonus in the shoes and prepared to spend it on his own. After Man found out, he took the money away, and the two quarreled about it. , Hui asked for a divorce in anger, but he was not allowed to move away, so he only hung a tent in the bedroom as the \"Chu River and Han Jie\". After that, Huichang fought with his wife, even pretending to have brain cancer, and tricked Man into taking care of him. , Unexpectedly, it was seen through by Man again. Manager Hong of Hui Company and Manager Mei of Man Company reunited, and the two companies merged together, and Man promoted the director, making it difficult for Hui and Kong. After the manager of Man Demei persuaded him, he witnessed the affection of others’ husbands and wives. Deeply ashamed, reconciliation with Hui is as good as ever.","popularity":0.3968,"poster_path":"/jAnw1zlpVUnReCkLXqwt6cUewXE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tai Seng
