His only Christmas wish in 2005 was to find the family he desperately believed to exist but never knew. Instead, he found something far more meaningful in the miracle of the RED BIG FIRE TRUCK. RED BIG FIRE TRUCK is a story about simple faith, patriotic dreams, and the incredible miracle of family.","popularity":0.0659,"poster_path":"/vlzClYjJrPuu8UbRS6D9YbX5eGc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54632,"logo_path":"/g5ZjMCwI8rbOd4cdxWXCb0IYCOm.png","name":"Bridgestone Multimedia Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Big Fire Truck","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3515138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethan Kuhn","original_name":"Ethan Kuhn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"625fb3617caa4714b5eddf8e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3515139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Peck","original_name":"Lauren Peck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"625fb36d3d7454009fd7834a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3515140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Taft","original_name":"Sam Taft","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"625fb3ec3d74540053e00094","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3515144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver McKellips","original_name":"Oliver McKellips","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"625fb47ebb070d009d4a497a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1054853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul McKellips","original_name":"Paul McKellips","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625fb45cd1a893009ca62526","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1054853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul McKellips","original_name":"Paul McKellips","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625fb4540792e1151daee9ec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1054853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul McKellips","original_name":"Paul McKellips","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612e48de6a34480090f2b34a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9204890","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1593,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vlzClYjJrPuu8UbRS6D9YbX5eGc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1062}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
