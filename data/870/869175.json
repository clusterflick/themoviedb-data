Blow’s moving memoir, which The New York Times praised after its 2019 world premiere at Opera Theatre of Saint Louis as “bold and affecting” and “subtly powerful.” The first opera by a Black composer presented on the Met stage and featuring a libretto by filmmaker Kasi Lemmons, the opera tells a poignant and profound story about a young man’s journey to overcome a life of trauma and hardship. James Robinson and Camille A. Brown—two of the creators of the Met’s sensational recent production of Porgy and Bess—co-direct this new staging, which appears in cinemas on October 23. Baritone Will Liverman, one of opera’s most exciting young artists, stars as Charles, alongside sopranos Angel Blue as Destiny/Loneliness/Greta and Latonia Moore as Billie.","popularity":1.1467,"poster_path":"/c0lfDFniRhwJrTCiHwY8Yq3STVq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":175,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Fire Shut Up in My Bones","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2618399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angel Blue","original_name":"Angel Blue","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/6h0sqSPVOkHKhKPboFEMfp4k89a.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"617072db1d019100679deec6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2721125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Latonia Moore","original_name":"Latonia Moore","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/pBB2HkHHgI94iKdvpQOlRvT6uIk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"617072ed2716710029f25192","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Liverman","original_name":"Will Liverman","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/uMpqumlxwRguvOIspDhtBIpxw9H.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"617072fdabdec000622a1dc3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5287,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Terence Blanchard","original_name":"Terence Blanchard","popularity":0.2284,"profile_path":"/rJIXX2O82ZAHBh7a1efZAz7JIW4.jpg","credit_id":"626e2f9124b333009835b0d3","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kasi Lemmons","original_name":"Kasi Lemmons","popularity":0.5457,"profile_path":"/rUtnynA95rxXb97EgdfETK1pVAP.jpg","credit_id":"626e3037cb71b813f8fb55c1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Halvorson","original_name":"Gary Halvorson","popularity":0.3687,"profile_path":"/9KwJweL5GN0y5rvsvBhBRlVtmb0.jpg","credit_id":"617525a5f85958002a4405f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Robinson","original_name":"James Robinson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617073502716710043b2f71d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3278240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camille A.
