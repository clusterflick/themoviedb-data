The campus' student union elections have been skullduggerous affairs contested by groups including Young Labor and Liberals, the More Beer Club, as well as a strong contingent of revolutionary socialists. In 2003, the Melbourne University Student Union (MUSU) was on the verge of financial collapse. Allegations of corruption against the union's right-wing student leaders featured in the foremost pages of both The Australian and The Age. Having spent two years in the political wilderness, the campus' left wing factions united in a desperate bid to wrest back control and save the union. The State of the Union is a documentary capturing the bloodiest election in the history of student unionism, providing an illuminating and often humorous insight into the microcosm that is university politics, and perhaps politics in general.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/78fKn2ldHpkqymGI2dOuBvU22K2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The bloodiest election in the history of student unionism.","title":"The State of the Union","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3219865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Newman","original_name":"Gary Newman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6130aa536a34480043d896fa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3219865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Newman","original_name":"Gary Newman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6130a9d0357c000091186086","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3219870,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bronwyn Polson","original_name":"Bronwyn Polson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6130aa9f6a34480062159d5b","department":"Writing","job":"Script Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3219871,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"David Veal","original_name":"David Veal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6130ab036a34480090f6cd67","department":"Art","job":"Location Scout"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3219865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Newman","original_name":"Gary Newman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6130aa826a34480062159d3c","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3219870,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bronwyn Polson","original_name":"Bronwyn Polson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6130ab13e2586000629c526d","department":"Art","job":"Location Scout"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3219865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Newman","original_name":"Gary Newman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6130aa3beb0932008db10865","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3219865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Newman","original_name":"Gary Newman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6130aabde38bd800601e9d05","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":755,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/78fKn2ldHpkqymGI2dOuBvU22K2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
