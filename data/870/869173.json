Raymond is also a priest, doing what he has wanted to do ever since he was a teenager.  Filmmaker Serge Giguère paints an intimate portrait of a man who has spent 30 years fighting for an alternative vision of life in his community. The film is a blend of cinema vérité and social history that provides a view of the man and his work from without and within, from the poetry of his personal diary laced with doubts and self-criticism, to the many achievements of the community groups he helped.  Filming over several years, Giguère gives us a sense of the changes in values and attitudes of those who run our society, along with the role of the community groups who provide solutions, inspiration and a sense of renewal.","popularity":0.3186,"poster_path":"/6IW3RRyw8a2VZZCfJi4Yxp1dmHB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20437,"logo_path":"/udmAwsZVjwjUCtz2gBMswim46kM.png","name":"Les Productions du Rapide-Blanc","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9 St-Augustin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3217829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Roy","original_name":"Raymond Roy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"612dfdabb84cdd00863a5578","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1296915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge Giguère","original_name":"Serge Giguère","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612dfc2d9bcd0f00239101e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0115444","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6IW3RRyw8a2VZZCfJi4Yxp1dmHB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2346,"name":"worker"},{"id":10093,"name":"priest"},{"id":18396,"name":"catholic"},{"id":161207,"name":"catholicism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1996-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"9, St-Augustin - Bande-annonce","key":"213720413","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-04-18T18:11:06.000Z","id":"612dfd53b84cdd00863a5538"}]}}}
