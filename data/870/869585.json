An exhausted ego and a needy id, the sensory and the lingual, desire and duty, horror and humility vie it out in a haunted hall. Captured at Headlands Center for the Arts, screams of a baby are muted out while the process of portraiture claims space for a body craving autonomy. Actions of pushing, vacuuming and rocking conjure the rickety bones of downtrodden ancestors, calling the laboring body from the periphery to the center, moving the rage through the body for joy to inhabit the space it vacates.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/s3PKaApzCW1xtOuA4FXX3D75OM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"sub vid heap","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2699448,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennie MaryTai Liu","original_name":"Jennie MaryTai Liu","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/lKSPXfRx0SWJUPJFuTR3fSHQK5.jpg","credit_id":"612f9a2ff621b20029a00360","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1012,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s3PKaApzCW1xtOuA4FXX3D75OM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":674}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CROSSROADS","release_date":"2021-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
