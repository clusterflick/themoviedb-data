While earlier films were devoted to crushing the established hierarchy of surfing, now their crew was the established hierarchy, dominating the competition, free surfing and the media. Kelly Slater was world champ, with Dorian, Machado and Knox all hovering around the top 10 competitive slots. Even the bands involved with the films were riding the wave, and the Good Times film release evolved into a full rock-n-roll tour with Pennywise, Sprung Monkey and Blink-182. As the name suggests...it really was a good time.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/lm97jsiopY1Swy2BbIqWc50El1X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151853,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poor Specimen Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Times - A Taylor Steele Video","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lm97jsiopY1Swy2BbIqWc50El1X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
