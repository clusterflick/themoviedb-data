A Long Struggle documents the impact of landmines and the government's use of forced labor, torture, rape and drugs on the various ethnic minorities that continue to survive in the South East region of Burma. Traveling through the jungle, sometimes perilously close to enemy fire, Rekow has collected the stories of everyday people inside Burma- an all but lost people who are rarely able to talk to the outside world.","popularity":0.0676,"poster_path":"/cL2FdI9IGFWlBFd11w8ZGJW2Frm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3788,"logo_path":"/1xYpC0Qc9q10AZdjdpsvcsFBo1l.png","name":"Gigantic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Burmese","iso_639_1":"my","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Long Struggle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lea Rekow","original_name":"Lea Rekow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612e468da4af8f0043d6f0d0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3218047,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sean Sullivan","original_name":"Sean Sullivan","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612e47abc49048008de295fd","department":"Editing","job":"Project Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lea Rekow","original_name":"Lea Rekow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612e46e3a13533006147b6b0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1770385,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Norm Scott","original_name":"Norm Scott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612e47fcfac50200426a7e44","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3054315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lea Rekow","original_name":"Lea Rekow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612e467b9bcd0f0042c036ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3218043,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matthew Phillip","original_name":"Matthew Phillip","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612e46d650733c0042c69cd4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3218048,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jonathan Gray","original_name":"Jonathan Gray","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612e47cd1d3563006249488c","department":"Crew","job":"Legal Services"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274021,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Beo Morales","original_name":"Beo Morales","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612e470e9bcd0f0042c037a5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3218045,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"James Dunlap","original_name":"James Dunlap","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612e472eb84cdd006061c44e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3218053,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Thompson","original_name":"Paul Thompson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612e482ba13533002a305983","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5903362","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cL2FdI9IGFWlBFd11w8ZGJW2Frm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Tribeca Film Festival","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
