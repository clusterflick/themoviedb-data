The simple one. The cheapest one. The most common one. Draw a line until the pen is empty. The length of the line is equal to the distance from the chair you sit in to the seaside.”, said a teacher to his students somewhere in Belgium.  I took a new ballpoint pen. The simple one. The cheapest one. The most common one. I drew a line until the pen was empty.  Working conditions were simple, yet sufficient. I needed an office desk, a chair and a lamp. Materials I used were paper, a ballpoint pen and a ruler. A repetitive task was performed. After two months, many hours later, the work was finished.  While drawing a line I was remembering my childhood. Those summer, carefree days spent at the Adriatic seaside with my parents and my grandma. Friends that I would meet on the first day of the arrival. Heat. Taste of salt. Suncream smell. Wizened fingertips. Hedgehogs in gardens.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SEASIDE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"해변","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EXiS 2021(Experimental Film and Video Festival in Seoul)","release_date":"2021-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
