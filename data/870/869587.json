Seen from underneath the surface of a lake, those men and women, fully dressed in office attire, move around trying to find orientation while following and bumping into each other. Thrown into this involuntary situation, their movements are at times softly flowing, elegant and caring, but change in the next moment into fighting against each other and for air. They are submerged in an environment which is removed from our daily reality associating sparkling fairy-tale dreams and horrible visions of drowning at the same time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ghUyYatckAJIfvVEH8d1m0nDlDH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Displaced","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3219055,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bettina Hoffmann","original_name":"Bettina Hoffmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/oBgDRa0y6KPG2YleRHGoj5VdEmH.jpg","credit_id":"612f9b3c357c000043e6d150","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ghUyYatckAJIfvVEH8d1m0nDlDH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CROSSROADS","release_date":"2021-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
