And it is in this mythical place that the roots of a multifaceted artist are born. Madalena Lima infects us with her intelligent, expressive and ironic way of being. Her work celebrates traditions and opportunities, as well as revealing contradictions and weaknesses, experimenting with new techniques without neglecting the concept. By telling her story, we enter into symbiosis with the landmarks that imprint a unique identity to this land in Minho.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1G193WcNfGAy1218wtwZvLwgq2J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160131,"logo_path":null,"name":"MDOC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2021-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soul of the Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3219583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madalena Lima","original_name":"Madalena Lima","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"herself","credit_id":"61304f7a74507d0043683dff","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2845063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Fidalgo Knoeller","original_name":"Lucas Fidalgo Knoeller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fBfXGGwwbvqG7iZSgswwkerxHQx.jpg","credit_id":"61304f94e38bd800601e3f2b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2845063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Fidalgo Knoeller","original_name":"Lucas Fidalgo Knoeller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fBfXGGwwbvqG7iZSgswwkerxHQx.jpg","credit_id":"61304fa674507d0043683e4a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2309354,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paulo Duarte","original_name":"Paulo Duarte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61304fd550733c008910ef1e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3219587,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paulo Duarte","original_name":"Paulo Duarte","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61304febfbe36f002abf4d98","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3219588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nídia Nascimento","original_name":"Nídia Nascimento","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61304ffdfac50200426f53dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3219588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nídia Nascimento","original_name":"Nídia Nascimento","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6130500fd207f3008f487a2a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2845063,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Fidalgo Knoeller","original_name":"Lucas Fidalgo Knoeller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fBfXGGwwbvqG7iZSgswwkerxHQx.jpg","credit_id":"6130501fe38bd800436b307c","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3219588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nídia Nascimento","original_name":"Nídia Nascimento","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6130502dfbe36f0065c3dc0e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bvBryAgSLuFNv9PpyfVrRY4MulL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1G193WcNfGAy1218wtwZvLwgq2J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"M/12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
