The word artful in the title of this work does double duty: the video illuminates a largely invisible and unregulated aspect of the art world in which the preservation, restoration, and sale of art can involve nefarious doings, and it reveals the cunningly manipulative power of the pairing of image and text in the cinematic context. Dion and Simon, longtime interlocutors who collaboratively produced this work, share in their individual practices the desire to examine regulatory structures that shape culture and normalize tendencies that would otherwise seem bizarre.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Artful History: A Restoration Comedy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3217361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Simon","original_name":"Jason Simon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612d472cd04d1a0065e971d5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3217360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Dion","original_name":"Mark Dion","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612d4737eb79c20062ea6928","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3217361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Simon","original_name":"Jason Simon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612d471b39b6c3002a816418","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3217360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Dion","original_name":"Mark Dion","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612d47029bcd0f0023901085","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12591676","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11800,"name":"mockumentary"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
