As he approaches retirement, you will get an insight into the workings of a well-oiled group and, particularly, the life of one of the brigade’s most eccentric firefighters with rank of corporal, who does not want to face up to retirement. The film focusing on his journey along with Javier Galbarriartu opens a window onto the work of a profession whose members risk their lives for other citizens. This documentary that discusses life and ageing reveals the feelings of the main character who still seems young, both physically and at heart, and who loves a job that he does not want to give up.","popularity":0.3805,"poster_path":"/a4jTO82znTt965wAgpCgioX2O5F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Day on Duty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3315801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javier Herrán","original_name":"Javier Herrán","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"619710cda0f1a20042dec456","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3315802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javier Galbarriartu","original_name":"Javier Galbarriartu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"619710da2811a10043bb0e1e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3315803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Cortegoso","original_name":"Jon Cortegoso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6197111b67b613004477e6fc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3315803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Cortegoso","original_name":"Jon Cortegoso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61971136fc5f060046aa36ce","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3315803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Cortegoso","original_name":"Jon Cortegoso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6197113eae3843002b1212f7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3315803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Cortegoso","original_name":"Jon Cortegoso","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6197114660c75100906f078b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12140782","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1399,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a4jTO82znTt965wAgpCgioX2O5F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4948,"name":"retirement"},{"id":192094,"name":"firefighter"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"LA ÚLTIMA GUARDIA - Trailer","key":"PUO6QStId8w","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-07-11T20:21:19.000Z","id":"6197101167b613004477e41d"}]}}}
