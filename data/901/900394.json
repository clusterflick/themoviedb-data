Hoping to escape an over-protective mother and an unforgiving adolescent Caste system, he looks to make a fresh start when he goes away to college. Unfortunately, when his free-spirited roommate learns that he's never kissed a girl, he posts Art's plight on the Internet. Fearing the worst, Art's life takes a turn for the absurd as he unexpectedly finds himself the object of attraction to a host of pretty co-eds. He also finds that he does not enjoy this swerve of events. With some comical advice and a little luck, Art manages to navigate through his new found popularity and freshman misadventures into the arms of a normal girl for his very \"memorable\" first kiss.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/gUGNZY0iSBQVMOvhvYFo6BaSATZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art of Kissing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3317230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Brodess","original_name":"Jordan Brodess","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Arthur Bennett","credit_id":"61985cdfc0ae360044f4582e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2061306,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joseph Campo","original_name":"Joseph Campo","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61985caf528b2e0044d8ace9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3317212,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mel Cantu","original_name":"Mel Cantu","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61985c3e5c071b0065f2b2c1","department":"Directing","job":"Second Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1234844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Sandquist","original_name":"Greg Sandquist","popularity":0.0554,"profile_path":"/sL0Mwl6dQ8tBSxxvGdmpvOg79Zm.jpg","credit_id":"61985cc01feac1006618cc83","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2373,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gUGNZY0iSBQVMOvhvYFo6BaSATZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1581}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
