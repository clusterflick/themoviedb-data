When viewed from above, we have an objectively distinguishable idea of a line, a pattern or an ornament.  In a labyrinth, we fall under the visual impact of a particular configuration of space, which it is impossible to get out of, being stuck in the disorientation affect. We switch to a subjective perception of life.  As we move continuously, the perception of the labyrinth space changes every second. Squares, streets, passages, corridors, rooms form a dynamic structure of the urban labyrinth, while going through which we are influenced by numerous constantly changing images.  The film represents an attempt to combine the architectural fantasy of a labyrinth and the visual experience of walking through over time.","popularity":0.2619,"poster_path":"/fcL8k6XuDPdubsoTGWU7GjAplrm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164958,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Schwitalla","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Labyrinth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Prokofyev","original_name":"Sergey Prokofyev","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jQQWoLALCqnQughZtHJNK9CskK9.jpg","credit_id":"619a445dbe7f35006499c35a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Prokofyev","original_name":"Sergey Prokofyev","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jQQWoLALCqnQughZtHJNK9CskK9.jpg","credit_id":"619a446f67b6130068aa153b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fcL8k6XuDPdubsoTGWU7GjAplrm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":560}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":288075,"name":"immersive"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"M/12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Planetário Porto – Porto/Post/Doc","release_date":"2021-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Labyrinth FullDome Film 2021","key":"557752783","site":"Vimeo","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-06-01T19:41:15.000Z","id":"619a45799603310062d49ce0"}]}}}
