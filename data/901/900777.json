The film explores the ways in which the current rural generation investigates their place in the world, the future that awaits them and how to overcome prejudices to achieve it. As they conquer the world of robotics, with incredible determination and humility, they teach adults what the future is all about, how to achieve it, and why it is worth it.","popularity":0.1014,"poster_path":"/81bA04sAstJwUqxbUFs6t0Noa9B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2021-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The center of the world is everywhere","title":"We Dream of Robots","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Casacuberta","original_name":"Pablo Casacuberta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6199d4c79603310043f52cc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Casacuberta","original_name":"Pablo Casacuberta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6199d4efabdafc002a26fcfc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318484,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matías Paparamborda","original_name":"Matías Paparamborda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6199d507297338002910b0d0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318484,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matías Paparamborda","original_name":"Matías Paparamborda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6199d51271458f002aa47037","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3180992,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gabriel Bendahan","original_name":"Gabriel Bendahan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6199d5a1e2ff320043744a7c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2437401,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Tortorella","original_name":"Bruno Tortorella","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6199d5c6af58cb0091b6bda4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318487,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Santiago Peralta","original_name":"Santiago Peralta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6199d5faabdafc00657e83af","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Post Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3274491,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laura Gutman","original_name":"Laura Gutman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6199d60c297338006443e9bf","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318488,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Juan Ciapessoni","original_name":"Juan Ciapessoni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6199d61babdafc004380fdef","department":"Production","job":"Co-Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318489,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rosina Danese","original_name":"Rosina Danese","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6199d67b71458f004298b86b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eRkpoyC3q7mHzjIjsFxe0mDb8G1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/81bA04sAstJwUqxbUFs6t0Noa9B.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5Fe9nD3IhnGqGbpNGr9ZuneFM1r.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1724,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/x3d9QC06Q38WutOKCyKJkKl0H3j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1149},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1149,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wRgZMMc1GYHUlemylDwesZpIOFT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":766}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul International Eco Film Festival","release_date":"2022-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul International Eco Film Festival","release_date":"2022-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Soñar Robots\" - trailer","key":"Xopr9k4duRE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-10-25T13:00:14.000Z","id":"6199d773297338002910b375"}]}}}
