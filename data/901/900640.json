Having been met at the door by Sally’s shotgun toting brother—Jews not welcome here—Matt takes refuge in a Victorian folly of a boathouse on the nearby river, where Sally finds him. Cue moonlight and music (waltz, please), willows and woods. Can one enchanted evening change the course of two lives? Once upon a time—there was hope in the land.","popularity":0.152,"poster_path":"/oSpk029j6E2REHqJRcuGuuTvUaD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Syracuse Stage","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Talley's Folly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Hamill","original_name":"Kate Hamill","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/AnT91gMtg0Dyo8qklZX7zVBmuTB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sally Talley","credit_id":"6199686a8de0ae006329fb7b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason O'Connell","original_name":"Jason O'Connell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5uoyReu7X7tRKDk7EQ1inONVb3Q.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Matt Friedman","credit_id":"61996877c0ae360044f5a09b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137968,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lanford Wilson","original_name":"Lanford Wilson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61996a2535db45008b14df45","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Hupp","original_name":"Robert Hupp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61996a2f9512e10062f18e05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yYZSHcZOrk7pAZerbfoFdJjs52l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1300,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oSpk029j6E2REHqJRcuGuuTvUaD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":867}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Talley's Folly\" Trailer","key":"ObE7BB0_GKc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-11-03T21:39:55.000Z","id":"61996aaebe7f35002ad247d8"}]}}}
