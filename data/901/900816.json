She illustrates all this with the use of electronic tricks that can, for example, petrify a human face or wall up a human being in just a few seconds. With an electronic trick, even human figures dressed in extravagant costumes return to nature: a man in a costume reminiscent of a bird turns into a real bird. At the same time, the scenes are shot from a bird's eye view, which, as always, emphasizes man's smallness and his loss in his own world and nature.","popularity":0.066,"poster_path":"/1U0YCllXe9ddH9X6DgAU9GAX1FY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48428,"logo_path":null,"name":"VPK","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":164942,"logo_path":null,"name":"V.
