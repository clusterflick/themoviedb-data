She frequently dreams of the feminine spirit of the garden, named Nunkui like her. The girl does not know this spirit, she does not understand her dreams and is afraid; she fears that it is a dangerous spirit, an Iwianch. Curiosity, anguish and food shortages lead Nunkui to discover the knowledge of Rosa, her great-aunt, who still cultivates a traditional garden (aja shuar). Little by little, the garden and the sacred songs (anents) become a refuge for the young woman.","popularity":0.2161,"poster_path":"/8kMp77H35lpUPuw4X5fuUDrACRO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Núa Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"}],"release_date":"2022-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nunkui","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3319071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Verenice Benítez","original_name":"Verenice Benítez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fc2830ca7ec6007b95f756","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624016,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juan José Luzuriaga","original_name":"Juan José Luzuriaga","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fc289c5f6c490082353e32","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3666682,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Domingo Ankuash","original_name":"Domingo Ankuash","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fc282035818f007f17348f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2163354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Nehm","original_name":"Daniel Nehm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fc2a1b6af8f8008d796c90","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3666685,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rafael Cuambra","original_name":"Rafael Cuambra","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fc2a0e62f335007db6be32","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3666683,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carolina Soler","original_name":"Carolina Soler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fc283d39549a007b4a416c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3666684,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yutsu Maiche","original_name":"Yutsu Maiche","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fc2a04e55937007c3d4e11","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2752171,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vanessa Amores","original_name":"Vanessa Amores","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fc293075110d0081be3f1c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624016,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juan José Luzuriaga","original_name":"Juan José Luzuriaga","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62fc28965f6c49007a65a992","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3319071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Verenice Benítez","original_name":"Verenice Benítez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619a7ff467b613002bc64b59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3319071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Verenice Benítez","original_name":"Verenice Benítez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619a8119c0ae36006219114f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9LWgPrHnRlDPf18WtrVEX5F9TAq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AtSrWvsaKd5rR8f3G7Tyv1yJdmC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":766,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/8kMp77H35lpUPuw4X5fuUDrACRO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":511}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":195405,"name":"indigenous community"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
