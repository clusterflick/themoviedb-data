The world-premiere of Helen Grime's Fanfares, which became the first movement of the work Woven Space, opened the concert before violinist Christian Tetzlaff took to the stage to perform the concerto written for him in 2010 by Harrison Birtwistle. Two more works close to Rattle's heart followed: Thomas Adès' Asyla and the pocket-sized Symphony No 3 by the late Oliver Knussen. Finally, Rattle's stunning interpretation of the Enigma Variations brought the concert to a close and then the audience to its feet, filling the Barbican Hall with rapturous applause.","popularity":0.1399,"poster_path":"/r0o9qWHHTJpQw6l3KaQkVDBqJbn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126347,"logo_path":null,"name":"LSO Live","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This is Rattle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Rattle","original_name":"Simon Rattle","popularity":0.2831,"profile_path":"/erFlB9B08lVMhEj70bLUpkr28iA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"61998db41e259a00274a87dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"London Symphony Orchestra","original_name":"London Symphony Orchestra","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"61998dbcaf58cb00666ad970","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Tetzlaff","original_name":"Christian Tetzlaff","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"61998dd2e2ff32008ef0fe32","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1709012,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thomas Adès","original_name":"Thomas Adès","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61998df4abdafc002a265478","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654968,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Harrison Birtwistle","original_name":"Harrison Birtwistle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61998e2235db45002c4c504d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046051,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Edward Elgar","original_name":"Edward Elgar","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61998e358de0ae00422a6ab7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1662007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François-René Martin","original_name":"François-René Martin","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61998fa370b444004247ffc1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318290,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Helen Grime","original_name":"Helen Grime","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61998e57c0ae360044f5e4a5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318291,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stuart Oliver Knussen","original_name":"Stuart Oliver Knussen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61998e7d9512e10062f1d3ca","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1044,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r0o9qWHHTJpQw6l3KaQkVDBqJbn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":696}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
