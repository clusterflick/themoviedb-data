Yet the community perseveres as the artist continues to work. Henry Chang, born and raised in Chinatown, continues to live and work on Mott street. Part of the self-reclaimed “OG crew” of China- town, he is adored and respected by his community the way community leaders are. While prepping to shoot, Corky Lee, a legendary Asian-American photographer and friend to Henry for over a half a century, died of Covid. Corky's presence and art naturally seeped its way into the film. Henry Chang, the unofficial official community leader of Chinatown walks us through life and art as we transition from the Year of the Rat to the Year of the Ox.","popularity":0.2387,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chinatown Beat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuko Torihara","original_name":"Yuko Torihara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6199c499abdafc008f44c3f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":1788,"name":"chinatown"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
