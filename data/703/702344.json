It makes complete sense that Cornelius, who has an almost obsessional devotion to the creation of programmatic electronic atmosphere, would find a place among them. The Japanese musician responsible for 1997’s remarkable Fantasma has ventured into video art before -- Five Point One, a companion piece to Point, combined hypnotic videos with a 5.1 surround mix of the album tracks in order. Which is basically what Sensurround does as well. As hinted above, this isn’t really a collection of music videos. They are too abstract, and too tightly interwoven with the album’s larger thematic concerns.","popularity":0.0561,"poster_path":"/l5GPoTuNx12BULhurM0WQqAC9vy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2008-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cornelius - Sensurround","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304540,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Koichiro Tsujikawa","original_name":"Koichiro Tsujikawa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6202cceed861af00b2b7e24a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316821,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Keigo Oyamada","original_name":"小山田圭吾","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6202cd08cf62cd006a6849a5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316821,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Keigo Oyamada","original_name":"小山田圭吾","popularity":0.0705,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6202cd10d768fe0066d0e7e5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rMZ9c0bzHrLJ5xHUXYHf5owtxou.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1071,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l5GPoTuNx12BULhurM0WQqAC9vy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":745}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
