His gruesome death in 2005 brought to light a double life: the fashion czar was strangled in his Munich villa by a young man he had recruited for sexual services. But who was Rudolph Moshammer really? The documentary delves into a boulevard-esque illusionary world and looks at the life of the dazzling bird of paradise, who is now considered a pioneer for the LGBTQ+ community. Drag queen Bambi Mercury goes looking for clues and close friends like pop star Roberto Blanco have their say.","popularity":0.1211,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rudolph Moshammer - Der käufliche König","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
