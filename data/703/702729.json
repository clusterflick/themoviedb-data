Avoiding the nostalgia of fashionable postmodernism throughout the eighties, Gwathmey partnered with Robert Siegel, and their firm continues to create innovative houses, corporate, institutional and university buildings across America. This documentary ranges from the deMenil villa on the dunes of Easthampton to their Guggenheim Museum addition. We hear from such leading architects as Philip Johnson and Peter Eisenman, and from filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who describes how a journey through a Gwathmey Siegel house creates the same sense of drama as a well-made movie.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/eP6tEZA20Wtkt5m5IqLRNzQAFvO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55550,"logo_path":null,"name":"Checkerboard Film Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Search of Clarity: The Architecture of Gwathmey Siegel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Spielberg","original_name":"Steven Spielberg","popularity":2.959,"profile_path":"/tZxcg19YQ3e8fJ0pOs7hjlnmmr6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eb8ec2acc277c00216f7d6c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Gwathmey","original_name":"Charles Gwathmey","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5eb8ec34bbe1dd0021856525","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert H.
