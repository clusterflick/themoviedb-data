In a distant and near future, both fantastic and absurd, men and wo-men survive as they can. Following a man, a slender figure between Tati and Buster Keaton, we discover through scenes of his daily life how devastating the effects of climate change are on humans and nature. How do we barricade against excessive heat or cold? How will it be to go to a supermarket, or a zoo filled with different animals and species? A disturbing and hilarious ride in the future, that is already our present.","popularity":0.0971,"poster_path":"/dR1o41OOzNZLCaW5KlDD3UbITMm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"2019-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sunny Day","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Faouzi Bensaïdi","original_name":"Faouzi Bensaïdi","popularity":0.1227,"profile_path":"/mtD7j4nujvg7shkDlBsBb5yjhlW.jpg","credit_id":"5eb82853f14dad001ce96fb0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Faouzi Bensaïdi","original_name":"Faouzi Bensaïdi","popularity":0.1227,"profile_path":"/mtD7j4nujvg7shkDlBsBb5yjhlW.jpg","credit_id":"5eb8290fbbe1dd002281c962","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Faouzi Bensaïdi","original_name":"Faouzi Bensaïdi","popularity":0.1227,"profile_path":"/mtD7j4nujvg7shkDlBsBb5yjhlW.jpg","credit_id":"5eb82908cc277c00216e3338","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4X8HBrfoXJTi2F1KMsMeIp5uxJd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dR1o41OOzNZLCaW5KlDD3UbITMm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2210,"name":"climate change"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Meet the Neighbours of the Neighbours during COVID-19 time","release_date":"2020-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival del Cinema dei Diritti Umani di Napoli","release_date":"2019-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
