Shot exclusively on the iPhone X, The Waiting Room is an unflinching portrait of the blood, sweat and tears of cancer treatment.  At home I filmed with my teenage son, as we came to terms with how family life was transformed by a year of living with cancer. The Waiting Room challenges the cultural myths that surround this disease, putting under the microscope the language of illness.  The Waiting Room documents illness from a patient’s POV, exploring what we can and what we can’t control when our bodies fail us. The Waiting Room 30 minute smartphone short was broadcast on The Guardian website as part of their documentaries strand.","popularity":0.5883,"poster_path":"/nY5qtmp2EA3iWT5awwmYftKU3sa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Waiting Room","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1708003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victoria Mapplebeck","original_name":"Victoria Mapplebeck","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"611617f3151c5c002c75bcbd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3196473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Mapplebeck","original_name":"Jim Mapplebeck","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"611617fbe54d5d0026747711","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1708003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victoria Mapplebeck","original_name":"Victoria Mapplebeck","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecd46f619690c001e712826","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654938,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shehani Fernando","original_name":"Shehani Fernando","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecd47078efe73001f157e21","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1708003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victoria Mapplebeck","original_name":"Victoria Mapplebeck","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecd46d0a3b5e60020599fda","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1708003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victoria Mapplebeck","original_name":"Victoria Mapplebeck","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecd46dd8efe73001e15a49c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2654939,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Darren Emerson","original_name":"Darren Emerson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ecd471319690c001c70adce","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10560434","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nY5qtmp2EA3iWT5awwmYftKU3sa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":854}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8496,"name":"breast cancer"},{"id":11612,"name":"hospital"},{"id":13005,"name":"doctor"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
