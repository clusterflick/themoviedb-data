As a result of the success of that novel, a great number of writers bursted onto the Spanish literary scene: The Kronen Generation. In those years, Luis Mancha wrote a book called \"Kronen Generation\", made up with interviews of those writers. Now he tries to reconnect them to recall what happened with them in the forgotten 90 years and what is going on now.","popularity":0.4056,"poster_path":"/vFxidDC69UqomCxR0TcxhsbCeMq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Generación
