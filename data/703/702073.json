In the focus are 125 objects from the Collection of the Vitra Design Museum. Arranged according to their year of production, they illustrate development from 1807 to the very latest designs straight off the 3D printer, forming a timeline to modern seating design. The film features many people whose vocations involve design and who are experts in the field, such as designers Hella Jongerius, Antonio Citterio and Ronan Bouroullec, architects and collectors Arthur Rüegg and Ruggero Tropeano, architect David Chipperfield, Director Emeritus of MAK Vienna/Los Angeles Peter Noever, Mateo Kries, Director of the Vitra Design Museum, Vitra Design Museum curators Amelie Klein, Jochen Eisenbrand and collection curator Serge Mauduit. And your guide through the history of chairs is Rolf Fehlbaum, Chairman Emeritus of Vitra.","popularity":0.6628,"poster_path":"/2l80W2zJIwTocAq19nl8Q2yM6VB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128184,"logo_path":null,"name":"HOOK Film & Kultur Produktion GmbH","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2019-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A History of Seating - From 1800 to Today","title":"Chair Times","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2637339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf Fehlbaum","original_name":"Rolf Fehlbaum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ebc46f6a294f000210c8be9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2695222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mateo Kries","original_name":"Mateo Kries","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ef9080813af5f00375724eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2280660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronan Bouroullec","original_name":"Ronan Bouroullec","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ef90821be7f350035a1202e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2695223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Brändle","original_name":"Christian Brändle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ef9082d13af5f003459e698","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2244867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Chipperfield","original_name":"David Chipperfield","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ef9085ecffeed00390401b3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2695228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Citterio","original_name":"Antonio Citterio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ef9086b13af5f003459e6e7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Bütler","original_name":"Heinz Bütler","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebc37e9a294f000210c79f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/LippDHWKOdXE5Lhz5BUz7UTD9t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/91xfiitiNgtTVHiW8dyn5kdT8q1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/lQT4xqzoKTOIlv0sGie74A9aS7e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":521},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1169,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/2SLpI51EIQRvV5nCkQiAa9rbavH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":818},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2l80W2zJIwTocAq19nl8Q2yM6VB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6096,"name":"furniture"},{"id":2985,"name":"designer"},{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"},{"id":221238,"name":"architecture history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Chair Times Trailer","key":"312808307","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-01-22T20:13:09.000Z","id":"5ebc49ee1dbc88001adb4b59"}]}}}
