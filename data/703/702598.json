The cylinder, well explained by \"Agostino-Eduardo\" in the comedy, is a representation of power, designed to intimidate the ignorant for its only evocative \"power\". It can also be seen as a sort of \"Pirandellian mask\", where the character of Augustine wears it to defend himself and represent something that he is not.","popularity":0.2093,"poster_path":"/b8wHMyqOPr0s3EFADS4AxOq1MnH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il Cilindro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduardo De Filippo","original_name":"Eduardo De Filippo","popularity":0.1852,"profile_path":"/qe377vtMNE7a7SzXYXf98bxKw3r.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Agostino Muscariello","credit_id":"61cdf928d43f010043135caf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monica Vitti","original_name":"Monica Vitti","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/fwDSIup9fJHnu7DHlAp20OSTDly.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rita","credit_id":"61cdf8b24f3a4c0042a977c1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca De Filippo","original_name":"Luca De Filippo","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/tL1oEW4JCHq0upYkGDUF79TUggP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Rodolfo","credit_id":"61cdf9a067b6130069c413cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pupella Maggio","original_name":"Pupella Maggio","popularity":0.241,"profile_path":"/p6ah7IoZ2yFEWp9UMjAHtsT2t3O.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bettina","credit_id":"61cdf9be109cd00068c000cf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincenzo Salemme","original_name":"Vincenzo Salemme","popularity":0.1526,"profile_path":"/tTucj6qOUhqv0QT7LDvKKLnveHU.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"65adbb283e2ec8010b04d6e3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":538696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Moretti","original_name":"Linda Moretti","popularity":0.2067,"profile_path":"/4RXo3cS27IP6jYj464OU9M89ITM.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"65adbb6509c24c00eab023f6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1176835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marzio Honorato","original_name":"Marzio Honorato","popularity":0.1616,"profile_path":"/yt9PYV8vhNtxlUrFd000lp5RRzA.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"65adbb6f158c85010a9fb821","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduardo De Filippo","original_name":"Eduardo De Filippo","popularity":0.1852,"profile_path":"/qe377vtMNE7a7SzXYXf98bxKw3r.jpg","credit_id":"65adbb1409c24c010a81e18e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduardo De Filippo","original_name":"Eduardo De Filippo","popularity":0.1852,"profile_path":"/qe377vtMNE7a7SzXYXf98bxKw3r.jpg","credit_id":"5eb84749cc277c00216e61ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4926552","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/b8wHMyqOPr0s3EFADS4AxOq1MnH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1087,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/15DJr0Nb8JKtlRHRKZqFg4q9pf1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/4M4aU6LinX8xF33DWikiic15kJB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4326,"name":"theater play"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"it\", \"native_name\"=>\"Italian\"}","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
