First performed in Paris in 1843, at the turning point of several eras, Don Pasquale, a composite and varied work, is the apotheosis of opera buffa. Performed for the first time at the Paris Opera, the production has been entrusted to the Italian director, Damiano Michieletto, who transports us directly to the sincerity and dramatic splendour at the heart of an apparently light‑hearted work.","popularity":0.3678,"poster_path":"/uOFinDnJil8B7JDkBjfv117ISQH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Pasquale - Palais Garnier","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Pertusi","original_name":"Michele Pertusi","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/fJx3QXGTMQ6Z0sCAQIvFIsyNLlE.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Don Pasquale","credit_id":"5eb9c743cc277c00206d6bc3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1691832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florian Sempey","original_name":"Florian Sempey","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":"/zIox1mOuEeWMNIulXzq9apCqMPm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Dottor Malatesta","credit_id":"5eb9c75dc3514c001e5c2748","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence Brownlee","original_name":"Lawrence Brownlee","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Ernesto","credit_id":"5eb9c86a511d09001fd4f9b6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1898098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Sierra","original_name":"Nadine Sierra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ekwYV61wshIQqlcaaGg6ZL5zEMK.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Norina","credit_id":"5eb9c88b511d090020d51846","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frédéric Guieu","original_name":"Frédéric Guieu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Un notario","credit_id":"5eb9c8a0bbe1dd0022831667","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1381395,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gaetano Donizetti","original_name":"Gaetano Donizetti","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/yBbXkriu2TFY9C8E6Scd6OPV9KU.jpg","credit_id":"5eb9c5ff0cb3350020d2d6f4","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383108,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giovanni Ruffini","original_name":"Giovanni Ruffini","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/ilvmvIKbfrEYUNFJ6J2sdWigxW3.jpg","credit_id":"5eb9c634bbe1dd002084b3a1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1381395,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gaetano Donizetti","original_name":"Gaetano Donizetti","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/yBbXkriu2TFY9C8E6Scd6OPV9KU.jpg","credit_id":"5eb9c64bc3514c001e5c262f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315444,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Evelino Pidò","original_name":"Evelino Pidò","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/lbuOYtLO7hPVTuNPB7eTrmZlnxk.jpg","credit_id":"5eb9c6abcc277c00206d6ab2","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2153172,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Paolo Fantin","original_name":"Paolo Fantin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb9c6df0cb3350021cf25a4","department":"Art","job":"Decorator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1898143,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Agostino Cavalca","original_name":"Agostino Cavalca","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb9c7007d2bc1001d00d8a4","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1570156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Jordan","original_name":"Philippe Jordan","popularity":0.1371,"profile_path":"/sSPyOAw49EgfxKeoD9ziM89HA1j.jpg","credit_id":"5eb9c8150cb335001fccaa2f","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/uOFinDnJil8B7JDkBjfv117ISQH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":266423,"name":"paris national opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"italien\", \"english_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"it\", \"native_name\"=>\"italien\"}","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
