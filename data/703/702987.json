Approximately every 8 seconds, I shot a frame. One sees a table with a vase full of gladiolas. The flowers slowly wither. Three goldfish are observed in their aquarium. A candle is replaced as it burns down, and the differing speed with which each candle burns becomes visible. A small television runs non-stop, set on the German Channel 1. There‘s a chair on the left where I sometimes sit to eat or read. A clock hangs on the wall, as does a calendar. When the sun shines, the window casts a shadow that meanders along the wall. At night, one sees the reflection of the candle in the static on the television screen. The rhythm of time is interrupted each time I put a new roll of film into the camera, sometimes causing the clock to appear to move backwards. Twice reality is captured in “real time”: when a fish is fatally ill, and once to capture the entire setting.\" —Milena Gierke","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/y61m44lbqONws6dwuT4mVqpCigu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time (one week)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1480658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milena Gierke","original_name":"Milena Gierke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sNbkeL0nxxZcBjONUNTOaI2cgJ7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5eb9d1d8bbe1dd0022831b88","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1480658,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milena Gierke","original_name":"Milena Gierke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sNbkeL0nxxZcBjONUNTOaI2cgJ7.jpg","credit_id":"5eb9ce40bbe1dd00228319d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y61m44lbqONws6dwuT4mVqpCigu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
