For his second collaboration with Da Ponte, Mozart was to brand the history of opera with a hot iron and forever haunt European culture. In this Libertine Punished, Kierkegaard invites us to hear “the whisperings of temptation, the whirlwind of seduction, the silence of the moment”. The Mozart-Da Ponte cycle continues with a Don Giovanni entrusted to director Ivo Van Hove. In the wake of Boris Godunov, the director, accustomed to examining the political meaning of works, presents his second production for the Paris Opera.","popularity":0.1292,"poster_path":"/6pr857A6VyW8U4ct8R3clRlq6Jw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de
