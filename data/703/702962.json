Markâ€™s personal documents were obsessively produced, constructed, and archived in a hopeful attempt to prove that he was here. Mark is composed as a symphony, comprising a chorus of voices depicting Mark simultaneously, each character representing a movement. We never get to meet Mark, though, and we never hear his point of view. By the time we gain access to his story, he has passed away. Mark points to the systematic erasure of trans history and works to rectify this. Mark existed. Marks were made. Marks were found.","popularity":0.1226,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mark","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634835,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hayley Morgenstern","original_name":"Hayley Morgenstern","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Olivia","credit_id":"5eb9c7da0cb3350021cf2637","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Morgenstern","original_name":"Carol Morgenstern","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Olivia","credit_id":"5eb9c7e9511d090020d516d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bridget Hill","original_name":"Bridget Hill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"The Scholar","credit_id":"5eb9c7fe511d090020d51741","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rahn Broady","original_name":"Rahn Broady","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The Neighbor","credit_id":"5eb9c80f511d090021d4e9a3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bug Davidson","original_name":"Bug Davidson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The Doctor","credit_id":"5eb9c820bbe1dd002084b691","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna Tam","original_name":"Joanna Tam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"The Public","credit_id":"5eb9c839511d09001fd4f9a7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deb Hill-Davis","original_name":"Deb Hill-Davis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"The Daughter","credit_id":"5eb9c84b511d090020d517a2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Hill","original_name":"Edward Hill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"The Son","credit_id":"5eb9c8580cb3350021cf270d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Todd Davis","original_name":"Todd Davis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"The Nephew","credit_id":"5eb9c86a511d090021d4ea81","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilber Munster","original_name":"Wilber Munster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"The Friend","credit_id":"5eb9c877cc277c002171035e","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Hill","original_name":"Sarah Hill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb9c7a3cc277c002171021d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2634832,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Hill","original_name":"Sarah Hill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb9c7b5511d09001fd4f90b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
