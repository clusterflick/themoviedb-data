They provide us drinking water, electricity, and they are vital to the ecosystems that have lived here for thousands of years. With climate change expected to destroy up to 80% of our glaciers by 2100, this issue cannot be ignored. This groundbreaking film deals with climate change on a personal level. Three just-graduated boys take the road to learn first-hand what we can do to save our glaciers. Working closely with glaciologists and community members across BC, Melt is truly a film powered by the people of this province. Re-discover the beauty of BC through an inspiring story about hope, community, and being a young person in this world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zAhZgty4YzBT18aLkFLMKKEqRu2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A feature which follows the adventures of three boys as we ask questions to find out the truth about our home.","title":"Melt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2633805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ethan Volberg","original_name":"Ethan Volberg","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb89eb50cb3350020d0a3bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2633804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierce Kinch","original_name":"Pierce Kinch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb89eaac3514c001f58abe9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2633805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ethan Volberg","original_name":"Ethan Volberg","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb89edd0cb3350021cdb070","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2633804,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierce Kinch","original_name":"Pierce Kinch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb89ed4bbe1dd002184cad8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2633803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kyler Dickey","original_name":"Kyler Dickey","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb89e9bb7d3520022e72aa7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2633806,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sophia Biedka","original_name":"Sophia Biedka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb89ec97d2bc1001cfc1de2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zAhZgty4YzBT18aLkFLMKKEqRu2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
