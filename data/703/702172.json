In this absording tribute to Chauvire, filmmaker Dominique Delouche captures her detailed coaching sessions with stars of the Paris Opera Ballet. Classical perfection was the hallmark of Chauvire's dancing, with a strong emphasis on body and shoulder placement (EPAULEMENT), and this is everywhere evident in her work with her younger colleagues, elevating their performances both artistically and stylistically.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fKe8rUbiydcTJBA5Tx23TM865Mn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yvette Chauvire: France's Prima Ballerina Assoluta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fKe8rUbiydcTJBA5Tx23TM865Mn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
