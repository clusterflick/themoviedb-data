Rural central Afghanistan, far away in a village. A young wo-man is milking a goat while her little boy is assisting her by holding the horns of the goat. There is a flock of goats and sheep waiting to be milked before the young shepherd takes them to the mountains to graze all day long. She cooks Quruti, one of the most popular meals in the entire Afghanistan but especially central Afghanistan. For some years people have been making less and less Quruti as they struggle to feed their animals because the mountain pastures have dried up. Climate change has affected rain patterns and soil fertility in the whole region.","popularity":0.0689,"poster_path":"/z9tjqkIYeJFTD0uupC6i06bbfVw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","name":"Afghanistan"}],"release_date":"2019-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Qurut","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285231,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shahrbanoo Sadat","original_name":"Shahrbanoo Sadat","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/jvS4sJgtUVsi8l2hUdj2TKUORZF.jpg","credit_id":"5eb81bbeed96bc0021a27ce0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14915958","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zNSx5SE1chnSuSFb9fRtKlFUi19.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z9tjqkIYeJFTD0uupC6i06bbfVw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Meet the Neighbours of the Neighbours during COVID-19 time","release_date":"2020-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival del Cinema dei Diritti Umani di Napoli","release_date":"2019-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
