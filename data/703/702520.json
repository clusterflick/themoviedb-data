Being confronted with the cruel elements of the crime, the next big shock comes when the son meets the press and his father's neighbors: Can the murder be explained by the victim's unconventional lifestyle? The Great Liberty (Den Stora Friheten) is a visually poetic film about love and about to accept what's different. It's a son's quest to understand his father and at the same time restore his name - beyond gossip, tabloid journalism and piles of police reports.","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":105670,"logo_path":"/1fLxrN5lOcZ35jJH9pXNx319KGJ.png","name":"MTG Studios","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Liberty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Great Liberty","type":"International Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5305870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klas Ehnemark","original_name":"Klas Ehnemark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67d563e431538de608f16a05","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1074498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Åsa Blanck","original_name":"Åsa Blanck","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/o3pBks2V4vSPOUiW0pK8N5CBsG7.jpg","credit_id":"5eb80626f14dad001be92da9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1074498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Åsa Blanck","original_name":"Åsa Blanck","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/o3pBks2V4vSPOUiW0pK8N5CBsG7.jpg","credit_id":"5eb8065a7d2bc1001dfdd9ed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1074498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Åsa Blanck","original_name":"Åsa Blanck","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/o3pBks2V4vSPOUiW0pK8N5CBsG7.jpg","credit_id":"5eb8064e7d2bc1001efc81e8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2633014,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klas Enhemark","original_name":"Klas Enhemark","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb80636ed96bc0021a26309","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1334949,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Petter Brundell","original_name":"Petter Brundell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d563ad577665ace5f1618d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1931416","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Svenska\", \"english_name\"=>\"Swedish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"sv\", \"native_name\"=>\"Svenska\"}","note":"Festival showing","release_date":"2011-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Svenska\", \"english_name\"=>\"Swedish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"sv\", \"native_name\"=>\"Svenska\"}","note":"SVT","release_date":"2012-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
