At the heart of the crisis that is destroying it, two young men, without work, without leisure activities, without hope, without anything... The film follows them in their daily wanderings between endless boredom and the expectation of the improbable. And shows their humour, their friendship, their will to live regardless.","popularity":0.4059,"poster_path":"/xUphRCijj7DqehzbWhyEmOgOVAf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11332,"logo_path":null,"name":"La
