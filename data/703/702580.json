They were very young, and their life soon became a problem. Zhenya ended up in jail, and Anya and Nadya ended up living with Zhenyas family. During the twelve years that have passed, Anya has done quite a lot of changes in her own and Nadya’s life, some of them involving Zhenya. The first time Zhenya went to jail – for beating Anya – he didn’t have to stay that long. But the second time he was sentenced to four years, for rape. During most of the twelve years Anya has worked with Zhenyas mother in their shoemaker’s workshop. Zhenyas father, a retired policeman, has come and gone in the shop, taken care of his granddaughter, but also had a relationship with Anya. When Sasha, Zhenya’s father, beats Anya and ends up in prison, Anya finally leaves Zhenyas family.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/5m4dQNgQQjUjdwkBugMaCPD8Hup.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96064,"logo_path":null,"name":"AMP film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2012-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once There Was Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Once There Was Love","type":"International Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Nadja's Story","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Russian Dreams","type":"working title"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"А была любовь","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Была любовь","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2518553,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dylan Williams","original_name":"Dylan Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60747d3bd8f44e00417363ca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Pauser","original_name":"Erik Pauser","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60747d609638640029bb9418","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1379177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kåge Jonsson","original_name":"Kåge Jonsson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/8YAfluzjLji2LNwhY9kt9TigYcU.jpg","credit_id":"60747d70ca8354006fbe834d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2363316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Håkan Pieniowski","original_name":"Håkan Pieniowski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/gCElob31xLkU8kW7u39F7gx3Dgd.jpg","credit_id":"60748ee02a09bc00578dd455","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2363316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Håkan Pieniowski","original_name":"Håkan Pieniowski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/gCElob31xLkU8kW7u39F7gx3Dgd.jpg","credit_id":"5eb82a20f14dad001ce97237","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2363316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Håkan Pieniowski","original_name":"Håkan Pieniowski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/gCElob31xLkU8kW7u39F7gx3Dgd.jpg","credit_id":"5eb82a34f14dad001be9468e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1379177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kåge Jonsson","original_name":"Kåge Jonsson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/8YAfluzjLji2LNwhY9kt9TigYcU.jpg","credit_id":"5eb829f30cb3350021cd37ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2363316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Håkan Pieniowski","original_name":"Håkan Pieniowski","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/gCElob31xLkU8kW7u39F7gx3Dgd.jpg","credit_id":"5eb82a2a0cb3350021cd381e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1379177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kåge Jonsson","original_name":"Kåge Jonsson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/8YAfluzjLji2LNwhY9kt9TigYcU.jpg","credit_id":"5eb829fbbbe1dd002082b261","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2464480","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/5m4dQNgQQjUjdwkBugMaCPD8Hup.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"SVT2","release_date":"2012-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"А была любовь | Трейлер | Артдокфест-2012 | Конкурс","key":"LD9jehPJZSw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-10-03T11:00:46.000Z","id":"60747e0b2faf4d00419200cf"}]}}}
