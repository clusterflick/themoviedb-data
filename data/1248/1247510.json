The journey to Greece is ill-starred because of unresolved generational conflicts, na√Øve prejudices and a disturbed father-daughter relationship. Not yet understanding their own emotional world and identity problems, they hope for each other's understanding and keep clashing. Will they find their kinship and perhaps discover common ground among their opposites? The film is inspired by a true story.","popularity":0.1236,"poster_path":"/zDh6LE40cGKW1zTNLN7IiVtY66k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Napkin English","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4252640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aylin Kalkan","original_name":"Aylin Kalkan","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Clara","credit_id":"65d46e621d3563017c1f305a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Malik Abdullah","original_name":"Neil Malik Abdullah","popularity":0.1319,"profile_path":"/tkGwUKnuYBABhEXNuYjXzmfBMpF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Thomas","credit_id":"65d46e6d967cc7018663076e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4547286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonie Dannhauer","original_name":"Leonie Dannhauer","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d46e53e640d6014aeb9297","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4547286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonie Dannhauer","original_name":"Leonie Dannhauer","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d46e46414291017ca29ada","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zDh6LE40cGKW1zTNLN7IiVtY66k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
