Someone has poisoned the illicit drug supply and people will soon begin to die. Dealers are being rounded up and murdered, with their corpses burned in ovens to \"hide the evidence\". In the 1960's, the government had a plan called \"The King Edward Plan\" to thwart any attempts by social activist groups to bring to prominence a \"black messiah\". In 2007, the plan will be resurrected. The plan will attempt to end the black market drug trade, destroy the ghettos, and bring \"order\" to the country. The government will control all aspects of the legal drug trade. Can anyone stop this plan called CODE: BLACK?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/co0qU1YsIaWaIrqAeKymNBHS7es.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Code Black","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1222685","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/co0qU1YsIaWaIrqAeKymNBHS7es.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
