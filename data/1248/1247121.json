Filmed mostly during the summer of 1965, the final full year before closure in March 1966, the journey takes the viewer on the line from Bath to Evercreech Junction, then along the branch to Highbridge and Burnham, before returning to the main line to continue a journey southwards from Evercreech to Bournemouth. But rather than just filmed from the lineside, many sequences were taken from the footplate or from the carriage window.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":"/uYfB7JnowpammuJFAsexnQsNgTE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Somerset & Dorset Remembered","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uYfB7JnowpammuJFAsexnQsNgTE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
