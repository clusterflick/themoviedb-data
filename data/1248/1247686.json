When a whale's carcass falls deep into the ocean abyss, over time its decaying body hosts a diverse ecology of surrounding species while also birthing altogether new life. It's body is a fetid dataset for biological speculations. Whale Fall plumbs these biological depths by invoking the long-tail of post-digital bodies and how they challenge orthodox conceptions of personhood, intelligence, corporeality, and life. Their heresy is to question what bodies are, and to explore instead what they can be.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whale Fall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4546572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dane Sutherland","original_name":"Dane Sutherland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d4edd7498bc2017a727a01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
