Aurally iconographic music fragments have been decomposed, then re-composed into loops and patterns, and combined with eclectically chosen imagery shot mostly in the western United States. The result is both a reflection of the artist√ïs sensibilities and a commentary on commercial media values. At once a celebration of visual beauty and a semiological investigation into how musical codes and imagery combine to create meaning, Shades Of Meaning has been called paradoxical, mystical and elegant, pregnant with multiple meanings and a powerful tool for reflection.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shades Of Meaning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Moore","original_name":"Andy Moore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d4eeeeb9a0bd0186685ac2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
