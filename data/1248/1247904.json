However, the majority of the time, the film comes first and after it's edited I search for a piece of music that fits the films length, rhythms, and tone. It is the opposite with this film, as it was for Tomorrow Never Knows. Boy With a Fish is a wonderful indie-rock band from Ithaca, NY, that deserves wider attention. When I first heard the surreal lyrics to this song I immediately wanted to attempt to express them cinematically. This is the result.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birds Fly Backwards","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1974883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rich Fedorchak","original_name":"Rich Fedorchak","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/pf5jRompbrrPl7gHwq2878yxtDk.jpg","credit_id":"65d562dc33a376018677d6af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
