They are approached by a couple of Monique's friends who try to tell them about a youth conference that they should attend but they all make excuses and fun of the fact they believe in Jesus. Seven years later we take a look in to their lives and see how they are doing. Sean becomes a successful hip hop artist, Monique becomes a crack junkie, Star becomes a drug dealer, and David becomes a leader of a gang.","popularity":0.0614,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Judgement Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1379162","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Judgment Day","key":"diDnDdssKSw","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-03-24T16:09:43.000Z","id":"66b8283d624bdbd3a01ddd62"}]}}}
