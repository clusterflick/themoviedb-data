The cryptocurrency market has crashed, putting their entire livelihoods up in the air. That's when Jared gets an idea: what if Monica became an escort? It could be a way to temporarily help them get back on their feet? Elise is finishing up her shift at a coffee shop when Ryder enters and makes an order. There's something off about Ryder, and when Elise goes to bring him his coffee, her suspicions are confirmed. Elise slaps him as a gut reaction and Ryder storms out of the cafe. Just then, Ryder's twin, Chris, rushes into the cafe. He apologizes, explaining that his twin, Ryder, can be quite the asshole and offers to make it up to Elise. In a strange turn of events, Elise ends up charmed by this good twin, and even agrees to go on a date with him after her shift. It seems like every cloud really does have a silver lining...","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dmdk7DlYsX7Yz5jbYSd9lmHHKQk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97187,"logo_path":"/p4SuncmnR1bxoA6GNVEA4tQIn4y.png","name":"Pure Taboo","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rock Bottom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1940927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Penny Barber","original_name":"Penny Barber","popularity":4.685,"profile_path":"/uwNKYQ7xqG5TcbKzcZxuwOMCpXF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Monica","credit_id":"65d4b547e640d60164ec057a","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":4014318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stevie Moon","original_name":"Stevie Moon","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/yQzChSbhM1utbVwwuByhlnT2ia4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Elise","credit_id":"65d4b563e640d6017dece9ba","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":3628919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucky Fate","original_name":"Lucky Fate","popularity":1.38,"profile_path":"/8EG6dJLzSCSdU0VxjpzL9vQXqGP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ryder / Chris","credit_id":"65d4b55ab9a0bd0186682fa3","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1457103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robby Echo","original_name":"Robby Echo","popularity":4.096,"profile_path":"/5kKMmSjg4OwJTIiw0pQ4o34nHb4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jared","credit_id":"65d4b5540f36550163e86cce","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1647480,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bree Mills","original_name":"Bree Mills","popularity":2.24,"profile_path":"/ql5DBazbVozMqktpcFv7aby2I0F.jpg","credit_id":"65d4b57709dda40188584433","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a5XWJa2uIuYFVhTeS79lZH6VYid.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1866}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dmdk7DlYsX7Yz5jbYSd9lmHHKQk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC-17","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
