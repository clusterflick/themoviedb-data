Despite deliberately avoiding any explicit structure or object of reference, the film speaks for itself, leading the viewer through an unhinged and chaotic sequence that, despite its absurdity, feel completely relatable.  It is a rendering of collective anxiety akin to Bosch’s The Garden of Earthly Delights, seeming to present a caricature of our fears out of real footage — to say you feel “as if a Lion is trying to break in your front door” might sound like an idyllic metaphor for your anxiety, but when the metaphor is made out of real footage, the absurdity appears to collapse into a kind of deranged realism. All your most irrational anxieties could well be real; the lion is really at the door.","popularity":0.5781,"poster_path":"/l2DVUtT8lBcBhgNq49iNuNfGoaR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":221301,"logo_path":null,"name":"Becoming.Press","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ultra-Core Anxiety 2023: The Anti-Authenticity Sequence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4547603,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"CosmoKramerist","original_name":"CosmoKramerist","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d4c2be23d2780163f3fc5b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4547599,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lil Fire Manic","original_name":"Lil Fire Manic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d4c276498bc2017a724ebe","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4547615,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"The.Ontological.Turnt","original_name":"The.Ontological.Turnt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d4c3cf0f36550186e9685f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4547612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"The.Ontological.Turnt","original_name":"The.Ontological.Turnt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d4c338967cc7018663479f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4547602,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chypho","original_name":"Chypho","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d4c2aefba625017c5c6f6c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l2DVUtT8lBcBhgNq49iNuNfGoaR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2800,"name":"psychology"},{"id":6711,"name":"crisis"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":155418,"name":"subculture"},{"id":202599,"name":"virtual"},{"id":328976,"name":"retromania"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ultra-Core Anxiety 2023: The Anti-Authenticity Sequence (2023) by The.Ontological.Turnt","key":"845669200","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-07-16T11:32:27.000Z","id":"65d4c193bbe1dd017d5facec"}]}}}
