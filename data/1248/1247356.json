I shot it with one continuous movement of a super-8mm camera held at arms length, outdoors. The original super-8mm film was blown up to 16mm. The first screening consisted of the two films (copy and original) projected one on top of the other. The projected image of the original encrusts itself within the projected image of the 16mm copy. The two images progressively de-synchronise; when projected in a loop they lose and regain sync with each other, ad infinitum. I taped the screening, creating a digital \"frozen\" version of the double-projection.","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"360","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne-Marie Cornu","original_name":"Anne-Marie Cornu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d40354eb79c2017e43f91f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
