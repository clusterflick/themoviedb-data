Cinema is a lie.\r This is the image of a lie.\r Israel is a lie,\r history is a lie.  These are images of history,\r images of the present,\r a history of images.\r Politics is history in the present tense.  Whatever happened to the Palestinian revolution?\r This is not the description of a combat:\r this is the combat.  This is a pamphlet about our daily suffering,\r this is a history of historical suffering,\r imageless,\r wordless.  This is a pamphlet for self-determination,\r for the rights of the peoples,\r for the right of return.  I must learn that the future is a habitable world.\r I must learn that the future is a habitable world.  This is not a film.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urgent Film for Palestine","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
