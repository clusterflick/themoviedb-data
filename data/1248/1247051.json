A work of atmospheric images and sounds dedicated to the retina, the eardrum and the soul. The young Inuit - the sea seems to have washed him up one day, to some place forgotten by God and time. Time, which is commonly called life, sticks to his fingers. Three steps behind him leaps the parasite of eternal suffering. The story begins in this enraptured sphere, focusing on a series of episodes in which the young man's fate takes its course: in a strange world that knows its own laws.","popularity":0.2046,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1986-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der junge Eskimo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4545439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Schumacher","original_name":"André Schumacher","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"65d3462ca313b8017d70e256","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4545440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Bee","original_name":"Mark Bee","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65d346334d67910149d32cc0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4545441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ive Eiholzer","original_name":"Ive Eiholzer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65d34640e04d8a017c990e4b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4545442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jürg Nutz","original_name":"Jürg Nutz","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65d3465551c01f017cc14829","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4545443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Weidmüller","original_name":"Mark Weidmüller","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65d346591684f70164d0b506","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1594003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Volkart","original_name":"Peter Volkart","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d3466551c01f0148c01b30","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1594003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Volkart","original_name":"Peter Volkart","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d3466ba313b801647006f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4545445,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jo Achermann","original_name":"Jo Achermann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d3467ddc86470162c6c820","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4545446,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anton Kalbshirn","original_name":"Anton Kalbshirn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d3468c28d7fe0149345302","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4545447,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mimmo Dutli","original_name":"Mimmo Dutli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d34698387651018632635b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4545447,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mimmo Dutli","original_name":"Mimmo Dutli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d346b628d7fe017c359839","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":293336,"name":"experimental film"},{"id":305843,"name":"art film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hofer Filmtage 1986","release_date":"1986-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
