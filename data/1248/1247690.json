The result is an ambient and hallucinatory narrative that spreads like a thick fog of dank swamp gas. Multiple logics, systems, and realities are entangled within Swamp Protocol, illustrating the warped mixed-reality paradigm we live in: a pervasive, horizonless swampscape that seems at once ecstatic, dismal and absurd.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swamp Protocol","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4546572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dane Sutherland","original_name":"Dane Sutherland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d4eed6eb79c2017e451813","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
