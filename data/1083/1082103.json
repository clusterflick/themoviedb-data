Sacred land, Philae has continued to develop. Over nearly seven centuries, it has acquired remarkable buildings whose imposing architecture is an offering to the gods of the Nile, as well as a symbol of authority for the pharaohs who reigned over the region. Adorned with the gods and pharaohs who venerated them, the temples of Philae transport us to the last hours of Ancient Egypt.","popularity":0.1252,"poster_path":"/6mVujZqvItfpLUdS05IafbQOyG4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Philae, the Last Temples of Ancient Egypt","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2223755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benoît Poisson","original_name":"Benoît Poisson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dd1b5dddd52d00848284ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8KHN3lCnHu0BfiE4tGzzzEngUMM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/yslgFePQ0UqoOyl0Pd4RpGsLuOW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/6mVujZqvItfpLUdS05IafbQOyG4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/uOPX1m9v7PVHJEeOP87LM0JP31y.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/cBF5HMwvFWmm6eMMpq193l84Lt5.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/ovB0qlv4BCcbTDWjUh64WJeFZl2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"RMC Découverte","release_date":"2023-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
