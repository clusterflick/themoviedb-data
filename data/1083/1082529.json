As the title suggests, the piece gives the spotlight to Finnish water towers, the real eye-catchers of the local constructed environment.

Water Tower Symphony not only documents but also revives this kind of everyday environment typical to Finland.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/thEHPW7wFeG0mf71jPVW1wug0AZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82265,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flatlight Creative House","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2023-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water Tower Symphony","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Panu Johansson","original_name":"Panu Johansson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dec474ce5d8200f3c0f786","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Panu Johansson","original_name":"Panu Johansson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dec4f68741c400c7f1d25c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Panu Johansson","original_name":"Panu Johansson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dec44b6ee3d7007a7dad6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2497934,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ilmari Mannermaa","original_name":"Ilmari Mannermaa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dec4baddd52d00a0bbc268","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2678806,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heikki Illikainen","original_name":"Heikki Illikainen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dec4e06ee3d700bc4aa6af","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Panu Johansson","original_name":"Panu Johansson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dec45f9974ee007f3355c1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Panu Johansson","original_name":"Panu Johansson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dec4a8ce5d8200aa7a2e98","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3906039,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Toni Kauppila","original_name":"Toni Kauppila","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dec491ce5d8200f3c0f794","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3906048,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jussi Rovanperä","original_name":"Jussi Rovanperä","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dec50bddd52d008483253b","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1692931,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maria Gullsten","original_name":"Maria Gullsten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dec4ce8741c400c7f1d24e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3906039,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Toni Kauppila","original_name":"Toni Kauppila","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63dec521ce5d8200aa7a2eb7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"VFX Artist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/thEHPW7wFeG0mf71jPVW1wug0AZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":731}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
