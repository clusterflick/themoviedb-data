The director, Russ Jaquith, has lived the snowboarder lifestyle, photographed six films around the globe and captured the authentic lives of professional snowboarders. This film shares all of it: the danger, the adrenaline, the pursuit of pro rider glory and the consequences.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/t8yn92NwbneZ8HyBGrzS43SGByl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stolen Good","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0438463","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t8yn92NwbneZ8HyBGrzS43SGByl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
