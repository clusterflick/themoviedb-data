What does a dream even mean? Where are the boundaries between dream and reality? If one can distinguish these boundaries, one asks oneself further questions: Is reality in real life or does it also exist in dreams? In this short film, an actor tries to find answers to these questions through his activities. The red and black colours as well as props like scarves or ties play important, meaningful roles as symbols of the dreamy life. The analogue 16 mm film material intensifies the mysterious atmosphere of the film and in its own way emphasises the emotions of the main actor.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3866799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arturo Sayan","original_name":"Arturo Sayan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63df76ca8741c400c7f2408a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
