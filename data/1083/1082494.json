What is a moment in our own perception, a symbiosis of sensory impressions. Which moments do we attach importance to and under which criteria do we do this consciously, under which unconsciously. On which paths do these go on and where to, how well can we control all this. What does a flood of seemingly insignificant impressions do to our subconscious? The title, which is not familiar in this form, is derived from the ancient philosophical research field of metempsychosis.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"metem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3905549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heiner Lüpke","original_name":"Heiner Lüpke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63de7ae5373ac200b5603800","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
