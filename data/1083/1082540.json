Starting from the subversive work of Natalia LL, Radziszewski raises a series of questions on issues such as gender, feminist art, conceptual art, queer and East-West relations and their impact on the art world in the context of the Iron Curtain. America Is Not Ready For This is an open archive in search of parallels between the artistic experiences of Natalia LL and Radziszewski, as well as an attempt to examine the rules of the positioning of artists in the art world, both at that time and today.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/o24nMqHGNSA9In6gJD9HvarpOum.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"America Is Not Ready for This","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2493752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karol Radziszewski","original_name":"Karol Radziszewski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63de9b78373ac200cafd43bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23867412","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/o24nMqHGNSA9In6gJD9HvarpOum.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
