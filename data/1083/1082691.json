Some say he loves music too much. When he hears a beat he must dance, in fact, he can't stop. Jasper's father, Jed, was a musician. He left to go on the road when Jasper was just three years old. Jasper used to dance to his father's music all day long until his feet would bleed. Jed knew he wasn't coming back, so he told Jasper, \"As long as you keep dancing to the music, I'll always be in your heart and you'll always be in mine.\" In Jasper's home, Shinola, West Virginia, the town's people don't know what to think of Jasper's uncontrollable dancing. Some think he's possessed, others have more \"colorful\" explanations. One thing is for sure, his fate awaits him at the Shinola County Fair. This year the fair features Jericho, \"America's number one banjo pickin' sensation\". Jericho plays for one reason - to honor his father's dying wish.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dual","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
