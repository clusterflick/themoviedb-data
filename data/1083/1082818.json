Whereas in the 20th century the 'new' communities are made up of black industrial labour, in the 19th century they began with black colonial seamen. The Tiger Bay community faced official, as well as everyday physical harassment which culminated in the 1919 race riots and a scheme for repatriation. The people of Butetown lived through the Depression in the 1930s and many of them served and died in World War Two. Since the 1950's they have come to share the broader experience of the newer black communities.","popularity":0.0673,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tiger Bay is my Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Struggles for Black Community: Tiger Bay Is My Home","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3902566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Prescod","original_name":"Colin Prescod","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63df7ab1e55937007b77dcfb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115622,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brand Thumim","original_name":"Brand Thumim","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63df7adee55937009ffe7e7a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1030593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Chappell","original_name":"Peter Chappell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63df7ad18741c40099b48e71","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
