Despite the fact that it contains ten percent of Earth’s freshwater, this massive force of nature remains largely unexplored. One group of people, however, is intimately aware of its power. From the surfers who catch its waves to the scientists who study its depths, learn why Lake Superior is a precious resource that should never be taken for granted.","popularity":0.2635,"poster_path":"/xKX4Yx79PdRYnZYY9lLKFfnE1wm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192616,"logo_path":null,"name":"515 Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freshwater","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3905822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Planchon","original_name":"Ian Planchon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63de9e96e5593700d6cb1266","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3905823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynn Melling","original_name":"Lynn Melling","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63de9ea89974ee007c29ecc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3905822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Planchon","original_name":"Ian Planchon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63de9eb4cd20460081e1d3c6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3905823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynn Melling","original_name":"Lynn Melling","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63de9ec0e5593700c745164f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3905829,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bruce James Bales","original_name":"Bruce James Bales","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63de9f476ee3d700bc4a9e45","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3905822,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Planchon","original_name":"Ian Planchon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63de9f586ee3d70093ea9d4e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21071722","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":864,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uMTa5yUH5ajocDvVCpA8t6MWv8a.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1535}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xKX4Yx79PdRYnZYY9lLKFfnE1wm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":541}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1329,"name":"canada"},{"id":5349,"name":"surfing"},{"id":1360,"name":"minnesota"},{"id":14785,"name":"underwater"},{"id":178026,"name":"environmental conservation"},{"id":215859,"name":"lake superior"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"FRESHWATER - Trailer","key":"532422767","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-04-02T19:48:24.000Z","id":"63de9f8e9974ee007f334dba"}]}}}
