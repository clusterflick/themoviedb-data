He takes a train, airplane, ocean liner and gets as far as the Egypitian pyramids before he realizes what she told him and, while Abner doesn't want the delectable Miss Scragg---at least as drawn in the comic strip---he ain't hankerin' fer anybody else to be wooing her, and he returns to Dogpatch to put an end to any hanky-panky that might be going on in them thar hills. But Disgustin', disgusting character that he is, has about a thousand bodyguards hired to keep Abner away.
