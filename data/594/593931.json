To watch Maestro Toscanini conduct this opera is a revelation. This man is a direct link to Verdi, Puccini and other great opera composers. He did the premier performances of many major operas. His tempos, phrasing, etc. must be considered definitive. I was mesmerized from start to finish. One will forget the soft black and white, and sometimes blurred images, the lack of subtitles, and the relatively limited sound frequency range, as the focus will be on what Toscanini is doing on the podium. Richard Tucker -- what can I say about Mr. Tucker? His performance was wonderful, clear, nuanced.","popularity":0.1817,"poster_path":"/p4hhpmwBiAgNqvkQVApfBPFpoDF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7928,"logo_path":"/tsa8zFtAIHlOJjL5G4fe75bBeCP.png","name":"NBC Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1948-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Its like a time machine!","title":"Toscanini Volume Three The Television Concerts (1948-52)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1917506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arturo Toscanini","original_name":"Arturo Toscanini","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/l8JdfzlCanzclA0voLy3o3oKTxX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5cad497dc3a36812a0193f94","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2285189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Tucker","original_name":"Richard Tucker","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Radames","credit_id":"5cad49969251417a82004cb4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herva Nelli","original_name":"Herva Nelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Aida","credit_id":"5cad49b69251417aa1005696","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Gustavson","original_name":"Eva Gustavson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Amneris","credit_id":"5cad49ea0e0a2630eb59998f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1711365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppe Valdengo","original_name":"Giuseppe Valdengo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Amonasro","credit_id":"5cad4a45c3a3681290193d38","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Scott","original_name":"Norman Scott","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ramfis","credit_id":"5cad4a6b9251417aa1005737","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"5cad4a9bc3a3681290193d94","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285193,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Doug Rodgers","original_name":"Doug Rodgers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cad4af20e0a2630fc59916d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":849,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p4hhpmwBiAgNqvkQVApfBPFpoDF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":1160,"name":"egypt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1948-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
