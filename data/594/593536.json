In a quietly progressive, classic film language with often staged reconstructions, the spiritual preconditions of the colleges, the efforts of the time, and the life that unfolded are told about the peasants and girls meeting the paternal, fundamentalist spirit. There are recordings from eg. Vallekilde Højskole and Frederiksborg Højskole, but very many high schools across the country are introduced in short clips.","popularity":0.1129,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":51313,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dansk Kulturfilm","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1944-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Den danske folkehøjskole","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sven Methling","original_name":"Sven Methling","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5caa9fbb0e0a264c88f5965b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0325222","wikidata_id":"Q20756084","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1944-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
