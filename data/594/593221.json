In three insightful conversations with female friends, collaborators and high school students, the director looks for a discourse about fear that is not fearsome, a discourse on violence that is not violent.  Direct cinema, horizontal process, self-criticism and narrative breaks. Mostly, this is a tale of universal sorority.","popularity":0.0781,"poster_path":"/ASbBYqHItSmtFVl7gKtnFKZhHG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116756,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walkie Talkie Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Galician","iso_639_1":"gl","name":"Galego"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All the Women I Know","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282447,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xiana do Teixeiro","original_name":"Xiana do Teixeiro","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca890cb0e0a264c6cf1d912","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282447,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xiana do Teixeiro","original_name":"Xiana do Teixeiro","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca890d8925141565afda68f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282448,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Belén Mendaña","original_name":"Belén Mendaña","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca890f8c3a3683f485f0e74","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282449,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Noemí Chantada","original_name":"Noemí Chantada","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca8910f925141565afda70e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282447,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xiana do Teixeiro","original_name":"Xiana do Teixeiro","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca8911a925141566efdc59b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282447,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xiana do Teixeiro","original_name":"Xiana do Teixeiro","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca891280e0a264c7df1d9ca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282451,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Uxía de Buciños","original_name":"Uxía de Buciños","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca891419251411467fd4789","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282452,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Iria Otero","original_name":"Iria Otero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca8916f0e0a264c80f1d0a0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282453,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leticia Fernández","original_name":"Leticia Fernández","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca89181925141565ffdc3c8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11056380","wikidata_id":"Q107363229","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hj8Pjigt3PJJ3L5ID7pi5CBbCW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wIE3Lyvtvup7L8GeXXcqOOsT4bf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1219,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ASbBYqHItSmtFVl7gKtnFKZhHG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":161316,"name":"social documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival de Málaga de Cine Español","release_date":"2018-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
