SWANS has always been a collection of singular performers, but there's been one constant since its formation in 1982--singer, songwriter Michael Gira. 'Where Does a Body End?' is a SWANS documentary with unfettered access to hundreds of hours of Gira/SWANS archives of never-seen-before recordings, videos, and photographs. An unfiltered story of a life in the arts, frequent difficulty spanning decades without a safety net, creating work because Gira says \"What else am I going to do?\"","popularity":0.761,"poster_path":"/1dqXCynVLkOWaZZ8R17bSuQuXwf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116858,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eyelight Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":161,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Michael is not a fearless person, but he is a fearless artist.\"","title":"Swans: Where Does a Body End?","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Swans: Where Doed A Body End?","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Gira","original_name":"Michael Gira","popularity":0.1378,"profile_path":"/qkqPCEMGOrKZJFbCW8zuvG5umzW.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cabbd860e0a2655f131249c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1193442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jarboe","original_name":"Jarboe","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/llhcuX4SB69kjWMrmvpyDiLik5N.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cabbe2e0e0a2655fa31256c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thurston Moore","original_name":"Thurston Moore","popularity":0.2069,"profile_path":"/5MFuvfhH1S0X6lTrJxq3QywG0Dn.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cabbea6925141699cfe9f4e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Ranaldo","original_name":"Lee Ranaldo","popularity":0.2286,"profile_path":"/c5nKR4iHOmYJBZTTQMNgqC14TFr.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cabbeba9251416990fe9a54","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1031742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Palmer","original_name":"Amanda Palmer","popularity":0.1363,"profile_path":"/gBWnIHJmQfKhUaPscNJQPRUuP1q.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cabbe91c3a3687d19b68535","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":499459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devendra Banhart","original_name":"Devendra Banhart","popularity":0.1492,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cabbede0e0a26560231280a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":996617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blixa Bargeld","original_name":"Blixa Bargeld","popularity":0.3459,"profile_path":"/k2wQ6aYnDCiGAP4s7BfV3ewypDS.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cabbf040e0a2655f13126c7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1486271,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"J.G.
