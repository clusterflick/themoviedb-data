The unedited film is the starting point of a journey across the universe of Pasolini. Non-conventional rebel and provocateur, persecuted by the censorship, praised by the critic and eventually the mainstream: from his very first film \"Accattone\" (1961) to the last scandalous \"Salò\" (1975), Pasolini fearlessly investigates burning social topics such as sexuality and the end of the grand ideologies. Inexhaustible lover of life, in all its forms, poet, philosopher, filmmaker. His revolution scandalous and candid, his sensibility ancient yet modern. A unique voice in the cultural scene of the 20th Century, and one of the most important figures of the Italian \"New Wave.\"","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/lBoqt0O4dDIaTLQovDiWS5tDuV8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pasolini Motore!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2283057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valentino Misino","original_name":"Valentino Misino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca98eed0e0a264c7df38e3a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9789636","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lBoqt0O4dDIaTLQovDiWS5tDuV8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
