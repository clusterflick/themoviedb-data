Mr Haroun was held on remand for 5 months at Elmley Prison. He has since been released and granted asylum but was charged under the Malicious Damage act of 1861 for illegal entry into the UK. The language in this bylaw, when juxtaposed against the physical and emotional feat of traversing 30 miles of the Channel Tunnel supplies the terrain for this film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On a Wing and a Prayer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351126,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alia Syed","original_name":"Alia Syed","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/qd2padqVYuJsNS0iFg0h0TEQgZQ.jpg","credit_id":"5cacd04c0e0a2679e2a272e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
