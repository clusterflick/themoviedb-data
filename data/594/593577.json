She had been due to travel back to France to spend Christmas with her husband, Daniel Toscan du Plantier and her son. Sophie’s murder was a devastating event, sending fear and shock waves across the local community in Cork and back to her family in Paris.  Over 20 years later her family are still looking for answers.  The Du Plantier Case tells the story of one of the most infamous murders in recent Irish history, looking at the case from both sides, a heartbroken family searching for the truth and a man campaigning for his innocence. Two conflicting stories, inextricably bound by one terrible crime.","popularity":0.1832,"poster_path":"/srSHa8Qrzw3wnImV7V8YcKOriYS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116836,"logo_path":"/t9JEYIFvQgjgdcdQPmB0JrJFBaX.png","name":"RTÉ One","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Du Plantier Case","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2283922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Darragh Byrne","original_name":"Darragh Byrne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5caae434c3a3683f4a63475e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2283923,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alex Sapienza","original_name":"Alex Sapienza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5caae48b9251411467013aec","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dJztitFbg3IReURcJY9cx84qhT3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ed8tHkkwrecEb5DSReBvvC3vQTo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rkUXgrnzdn0XNZdbNcar9x6f9Qn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/srSHa8Qrzw3wnImV7V8YcKOriYS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33722,"name":"true crime"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Du Plantier Case | Tonight | RTÉ One | 9.35pm","key":"kVczu-tGJD0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2017-07-24T13:43:32.000Z","id":"5caae78a925141565f01746d"}]}}}
