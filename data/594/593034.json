Mainly due to the resistance of nature, the project failed and was abandoned some 20 years later. Fordlandia is a voyage of (de)colonisation whereby the drifts and detours of modernity in uncertain places are highlighted, turning away from whatever their historical imaginaries were. The tensions between industrial and natural landscape are levelled off in a certain horizontality of hierarchies between form and content, and at the same time the animal resignifies possibilities of the community of the living.","popularity":0.2353,"poster_path":"/sz1WOFvaVRW8hloQWB0oBJAB2ft.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2014-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fordlandia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melanie Smith","original_name":"Melanie Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ca6e89f0e0a266cf7332ea7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27478467","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.651,"height":1934,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sz1WOFvaVRW8hloQWB0oBJAB2ft.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1260}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":210812,"name":"industrialisation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
