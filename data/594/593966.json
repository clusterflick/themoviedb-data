One of the mothers, Jennifer Jean Hart, was determined to have been under the influence when she drove her family off a cliff on the Pacific Coast Highway and into the ocean more than 100 feet below. Now, the documentary Thread of Deceit: The Hart Family Tragedy delves into the story of Jennifer, her wife, Sarah Hart, and their six foster children. Among those immediately identified after the crash were the mothers of the family, both 38, and their foster children -- Martin, 19, Abigail, 14, and Jeremiah, 14. It was determined that Jennifer had a blood alcohol level of .102, while her wife and the three kids found at the time had been dosed with diphenhydramine, the active ingredient in Benadryl. The bodies of Hannah, 16, and Sierra, 12, were found later. Only Devonte, 15, remains missing.","popularity":0.2285,"poster_path":"/rUGXqoziFSOPtPmZHgMl94QzCH8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116921,"logo_path":null,"name":"Align Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":116922,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sharkeye Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":132255,"logo_path":null,"name":"1091 Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Thread of Deceit: The Hart Family Tragedy","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67156,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Kobin","original_name":"Chris Kobin","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cad90569251417a8000b0c4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2602657,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rachel Morgan","original_name":"Rachel Morgan","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e973e6cd1444300144fc32b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67156,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Kobin","original_name":"Chris Kobin","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb2ec92f74f5f001e961e38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2602657,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rachel Morgan","original_name":"Rachel Morgan","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb2eca0edeb430023cb3d49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8234968","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sy4LkbXSk1Di5cY0dKWaT8GJomf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7V313SrUkEcIFKJa8xbrRfCja49.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rUGXqoziFSOPtPmZHgMl94QzCH8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ihTbOqwRqngebg0Fsr79cQndCyg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33722,"name":"true crime"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Thread of Deceit: The Hart Family Tragedy (2020) | Official Trailer HD","key":"im8qJjvfK2Q","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2020-02-19T21:26:07.000Z","id":"5e973f28097c4900190a361c"}]}}}
