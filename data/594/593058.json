During my university days, I volunteered as a ticket seller in order to watch films for free. Many years later, I received the top award at the Taipei Film Festival in an award ceremony held here as well. I have also run a coffeehouse here and often held small screenings of classic films during that time. Last year, I shot my film, Your Face, inside Guangfu Auditorium. The film was composed of thirteen big close-ups. Each of those thirteen faces was filled with the passage of time. Now, I am given a chance to film Zhongshan Hall again. I switched off all the lights and allowed the warm winter sun to shine on her face.\"","popularity":0.1539,"poster_path":"/aB3TAs5IuprxlW1VETMmvsObcxn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2018-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Light","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"Guang","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Tsai Ming-liang's Light","type":"Distro title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tsai Ming-liang","original_name":"蔡明亮","popularity":0.566,"profile_path":"/ceVmDE537vnoxiGmkoNOf5srJWr.jpg","credit_id":"5ca718b1c3a3683b3baaeb7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1055,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mBIcLPmzJFojtIs4H42jGqTL3b2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1878}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aB3TAs5IuprxlW1VETMmvsObcxn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Taiwan Film Festival","release_date":"2019-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"HKIFF ","release_date":"2019-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Singapore International Festival of Arts","release_date":"2019-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
