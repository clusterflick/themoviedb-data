It’s 1972, not long after the ‘summer of love’, the Age of Aquarius is maybe coming to an end but “freedom” is still the byword of existence. Chris, Liam, &. Manny are floating aimlessly only peripherally aware that there is “more” out there. Equally lovable as they are inept, they decide to open a bar without any previous ability or concept of what it takes.  Through the trials and tribulations of their journey, they come to discover who they are as individuals and what they really want in life.","popularity":0.1748,"poster_path":"/tG8NUJGWhVI3LlTa8MRug3c4WrJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Across The Rails","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1942230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Courtney Dlugos","original_name":"Courtney Dlugos","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/yLeiTXdYnS4BcOEn8JrBsY16HoW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lena","credit_id":"6759eb8930336932a563843c","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15391262","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"AcrossTheRailsMovie","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tG8NUJGWhVI3LlTa8MRug3c4WrJ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1944},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2667,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1PKrOAWKbFRYTnvtpY3oqq0gM4g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Across The Rails - Official Trailer","key":"284255847","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-08-09T22:43:29.000Z","id":"5caa405e925141566e00b20c"}]}}}
