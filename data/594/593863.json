Linking places as far flung as the Canadian Northwest Passage and a cellular prison in the Andaman Islands, the three Missives create an extended narrative recited by the female captain of a ship returning to the Thames from the Canadian Arctic. Meta Incognita: Missive II is based on the exploits of the Elizabethan privateer turned explorer Martin Frobisher, who repeatedly sailed to the Canadian Arctic in search of the Northwest Passage. Set in a future where global warming has opened up the Northwest Passage to heavy/commercial/trans-continental cargo trade, the narrative follows a renegade shipâ€™s captain who has undertaken a commission to smuggle the last remnants of an unspecified natural resource.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meta Incognita: Missive II","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351126,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alia Syed","original_name":"Alia Syed","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/qd2padqVYuJsNS0iFg0h0TEQgZQ.jpg","credit_id":"5cacd09a0e0a2679e8a27a24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
