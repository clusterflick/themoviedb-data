Focusing on the fishermen and their stories, Tsuchimoto and his crew made their subject matter the “theft of the sea” perpetrated by giant business conglomerates. While the fishermen of Minamata were obvious victims of the mercury­-poisoning tragedy, the fishermen in Shimokita were inadvertently becoming the permanent victims of another announced trag­edy. Tsuchimoto interviews the fishermen, especially focusing on a stage play actor and his boat­-owner family, establishing, as it became his practice, a complex reflection about the threat brought to small communities by the forces of “progress”.","popularity":0.1151,"poster_path":"/lJ8bJx2YmsOHrS0sCpqwMKU9ELv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117934,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seirinsha","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1984-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stolen Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Umitori - Shimokita hanto Hamasekine","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Umitori – The Stolen Sea at the Shimokita Peninsula","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Umitori—Robbing the Sea at Shimokita Peninsula","type":"festival title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":555186,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yoshio Shimizu","original_name":"Yoshio Shimizu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6220f80542bf01001d053def","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4506860,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Torazo Matsuhashi","original_name":"Torazo Matsuhashi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b7edac1089ba0164f91422","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1517986,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yuji Takahashi","original_name":"高橋悠治","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b7edbb9ba86a017bf9f2c6","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1634161,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tetsujirô Yamagami","original_name":"山上徹二郎","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b7edb3a0b690017bcfb850","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noriaki Tsuchimoto","original_name":"土本典昭","popularity":0.1366,"profile_path":"/kcr6g8u1kHHwVx8fT3g5cA2SGWh.jpg","credit_id":"5cacd22e925141425272ed67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1440368","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1434,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lJ8bJx2YmsOHrS0sCpqwMKU9ELv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1014},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1434,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z93CYPoHGKE2J8vfqW0Cdjd5h6A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1014}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
