The different locations include a reservoir, for which Faoro has a particular lineal affection, a cemetery in the Bronx where his ancestors were buried, and a slaughterhouse in upstate New York. Consequently, the film explores themes of family, death and the loss of innocence. In doing so, it creates a concentrated rhythm and familiar cyclical pattern of movement; both of which result in a subconscious pursuit of the inevitable.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hPeQYs591cHesZuCGVJQdtLVo1g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Melody of Decomposition","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2284468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Faoro","original_name":"Alex Faoro","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cabdc44c3a3687d12b6ae08","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":899,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hPeQYs591cHesZuCGVJQdtLVo1g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":599}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vimeo","release_date":"2018-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
