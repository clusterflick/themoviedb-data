De Gaulle famously said: “Old age is a shipwreck”. Although they may be his contemporaries, this statement does not quite apply to those 4 swimmers. At 78, 88 or even 101 years old, they’re still determined to break new records in competitive swimming. In their film, Maya Lussier-Seguin and Pierre-Olivier François have portrayed these four champions of the Masters category across today’s France during the 2014/2015 sporting season. They share a passion for swimming. And that’s how they rise above their old age and the difficulties that a youth-fuelled society would rather forget all about. As they go about their training, they speak about solitude and how to best avoid it, about the hurdles of life and how they overcame them, about our society that neglects or dismisses our elders and how they deal with it all.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/olVsgift4Bg1ehiEK8B7QSd78Ic.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swim for Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maya Lussier-Séguin","original_name":"Maya Lussier-Séguin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cada2539251417a8000c7d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6375386","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/olVsgift4Bg1ehiEK8B7QSd78Ic.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
