In the stunning southern Spanish city of Jaén, olive oil is a way of life. Recently, a revolution broke out in this region sparking a new appreciation for Jaén’s emblematic Picual olive oil that was pivotal in bringing this city to the zenith of olive oil production. This documentary introduces us to the challenges raised by these radical changes as seen through the eyes of the people from the Jaén olive groves, the chefs who experienced the gastronomical transformation, the olive-producers and the all-important consumers. With precision and emotion, the cast describes the life cycle of olive oil, from the tree to the table, allowing the audience to share the vibrant spirit and culture surrounding olive cultivation and oil production in the largest producing region in the world.","popularity":0.2048,"poster_path":"/j7O8aACNiEdKf1xAyJ8D4HGoQm8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Virgin & Extra: The Land of the Olive Oil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Virgin and Extra: Jaén, the Land of the Olive Oil","type":"Spanish Film Festival"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"純淬：橄欖油的原鄉","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":106697,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Luis López-Linares","original_name":"José Luis López-Linares","popularity":0.0851,"profile_path":"/kPP7N79I5Q4ge99yPSgYDfzIFgy.jpg","credit_id":"5cad4dc3c3a36812ae194582","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10374622","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j7O8aACNiEdKf1xAyJ8D4HGoQm8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1772,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/aYHxoGuEOG0vZe7lrbFW7FMNgGd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1241},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1415,"iso_639_1":"lt","file_path":"/dt5Eflm07KeUttXU9qoOs8H4WEO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":324545,"name":"olive oil"},{"id":340616,"name":"southern spanish city of jaén"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Spanish Film Festival","release_date":"2019-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
