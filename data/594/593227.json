On occasion he recorded with a small group from his orchestra or as a piano soloist, but Duke was rarely filmed in that capacity... with a few exceptions. On January 23, 1967, Ellington filmed two programs for Danish television. The first has him jamming with an octet taken from his orchestra, including such greats as altoist Johnny Hodges, tenor-saxophonist Paul Gonsalves, baritonist Harry Carney and trumpeter Cat Anderson. Highlights include \"The Jeep Is Jumpin',\" \"Sophisitcated Lady\" and \"Jam with Sam.\" The second program puts the focus on Ellington's piano, in solo and trio performances that include \"Lotus Blossom,\" \"Mood Indigo,\" and a definitive version of \"Take the 'A' Train.\" Always a modern and distinctive soloist, Ellington is seen creating brilliant improvisations full of strong melodies, subtle surprises and sly wit.","popularity":0.19,"poster_path":"/hD2RI85iiT4a4eoRPGKdC83VaNl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3086,"logo_path":"/iksa7hXQMvPIzfSq0Tuo4WPU8gc.png","name":"Image Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Intimate Duke Ellington","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duke Ellington","original_name":"Duke Ellington","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":"/eeGUhNryUGMWpUupvKE61aFjzAp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ca89ef30e0a264c8bf1bf30","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Hodges","original_name":"Johnny Hodges","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ca89f2dc3a3683f4c5f06a0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2282495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Gonsalves","original_name":"Paul Gonsalves","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ca89f449251415657fddd11","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":852,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hD2RI85iiT4a4eoRPGKdC83VaNl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":599}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1416,"name":"jazz"},{"id":2636,"name":"blues"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
