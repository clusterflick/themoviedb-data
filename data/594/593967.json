A few weeks after this terrible accident, and while there is no time to lose, Yannick Jadot negotiates at the European Parliament for better security for the most nuclearized continent on the planet, whereas the majority political parties try to rationalize this extraordinary event. At the same time, the young deputy is an advisor to Eva Joly, the candidate for the presidential primary in the Ecologist party. They try to make visible and audible the necessity to abandon the atom during the campaign for the French presidential elections. But very soon he finds himself caught up in the spiral of events, strategy, polls and fake alliances.","popularity":0.0891,"poster_path":"/lbgoZbbWTDo4nQZEviCqEhPCHnP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6585,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Du Rat","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amère Victoire","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3497708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yannick Jadot","original_name":"Yannick Jadot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5M64HTumppni9kztUSqC1l3RAAv.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68094022c96e0dcc05ee5e97","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1512848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Joly","original_name":"Eva Joly","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/fedOGl4TkuBFeMnWzLoQkVCEhiT.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6809402eac02d4407bab7621","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1141516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Bové","original_name":"José Bové","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":"/48Ko6hdGRk0ykd65VDLFXvUkrOI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68094037142b09cecf8a1169","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285267,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Verdier-Korbel","original_name":"Luc Verdier-Korbel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cad8e05c3a36812b319a93f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285267,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Verdier-Korbel","original_name":"Luc Verdier-Korbel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68093e57271ecb3ae089fe51","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285267,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Verdier-Korbel","original_name":"Luc Verdier-Korbel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68093e63c3e8e74b6def0893","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2285267,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Verdier-Korbel","original_name":"Luc Verdier-Korbel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68093e70c96e0dcc05ee5e14","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2273596,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cathie Dambel","original_name":"Cathie Dambel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68093e7fc3e8e74b6def089d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6203894","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/JbELdKkP7VdeV8Lo2c3ShFtUxE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kCo7QmxYeC0MBXqJ3pGRRM6Q9kF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lbgoZbbWTDo4nQZEviCqEhPCHnP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":714}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7389,"name":"anti-nuclear activist"},{"id":15174,"name":"ecology"},{"id":215355,"name":"fukushima disaster (2011)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
