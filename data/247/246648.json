The first sequence is a simple demonstration of the canon \"Frere Jacques\" where four cubes dance and combine with one another on a checkerboard. The second sequence show four little human-like figures dancing in space. The third and most elaborate sequence shows a human going through several strange gesticulations. Through multiple printing we realize that the man, as in the previous sequences, is part of a visual canon and is making the gestures to himself. As we hear variations on the canonic theme so too do we witness visual variations: a woman and cat enters the canon. To show the musical technique of inversion, the image of the man is printed upside down.","popularity":0.0824,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1964-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Canon","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065698,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norman McLaren","original_name":"Norman McLaren","popularity":0.0871,"profile_path":"/rD180RxxIcxdCZbI2X5sfSb4lT.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4f18c3a36847f82bd3e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grant Munro","original_name":"Grant Munro","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f18c3a36847f82bd3e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":957757,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eldon Rathburn","original_name":"Eldon Rathburn","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ead09ca66469a001c5cd3ea","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0057912","wikidata_id":"Q2936441","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Montreal","release_date":"1964-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
