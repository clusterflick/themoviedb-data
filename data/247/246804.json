Each bouquet of flowers is also a bouquet of frames mingling the plants to be found in a given place with the activities that happen to be there at the time. Lowder uses the film strip as a canvas with the freedom to film frames on any part of the strip in any order, running the film through the camera as many times as needed.","popularity":0.0491,"poster_path":"/sBSVQgEDICGcupTWKLKQKcec9iO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1995-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bouquets 1-10","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Bouquets 6-10","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1286993,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rose Lowder","original_name":"Rose Lowder","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":"/iRDL93tiLU9Sp5SANiMG8wGug6.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4f1bc3a36847f82bde15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3732164","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/brng5N6M17gnALjrjRONdWITbaN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sBSVQgEDICGcupTWKLKQKcec9iO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":855,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zr0MjCfqHstfTaWhcGUSIpFl95r.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hiyZZMYW29n2EXX9tXqkvPAIJml.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Scratch projection","release_date":"1995-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
