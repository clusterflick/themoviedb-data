In his search for funds, Buck meets Patricia Harper, the fourth-richest girl in the world, but he isn't aware of that and thinks she is penniless. Patricia joins his troupe as a lark, and her father, James Harper, also pretends he is broke. Through some chicanery, Buck gets jobs for the girls as models at the Palace of Feminine Arts at the Paris International Exposition. James Harper borrows the priceless Napoleaon necklace to have a copy made for his daughter, but Buck thinks he stole it.","popularity":1.2357,"poster_path":"/iwAMAprrlrCTNEwHf5ia2GXjhjx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1938-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's an ooh-la-lalapalooza!","title":"Artists and Models Abroad","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Benny","original_name":"Jack Benny","popularity":0.3909,"profile_path":"/nHhy8tF4WjGWvAfv0tM2pyl4D6R.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Buck Boswell","credit_id":"52fe4f15c3a36847f82bc891","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Bennett","original_name":"Joan Bennett","popularity":0.6664,"profile_path":"/3xKU8SKCytMMBeIXzfZXvwaq0oO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Patricia Harper","credit_id":"52fe4f15c3a36847f82bc895","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":88870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Boland","original_name":"Mary Boland","popularity":0.1474,"profile_path":"/mqQFCk1l04bnqs5prmrDkupVy8B.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Isabel Channing","credit_id":"52fe4f15c3a36847f82bc899","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Grapewin","original_name":"Charley Grapewin","popularity":0.4917,"profile_path":"/xROPwMkTUgweYQFhbTsvklIMhlw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"James Harper","credit_id":"52fe4f15c3a36847f82bc89d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Feld","original_name":"Fritz Feld","popularity":0.2544,"profile_path":"/yVT0Gv9O4K9UHU8jBx8D01lZjYZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dubois","credit_id":"52fe4f15c3a36847f82bc8a5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":951894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phyllis Kennedy","original_name":"Phyllis Kennedy","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":"/gnz5jKBvUroBJJbiYNKENObfkuj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"52fe4f16c3a36847f82bc8a9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monty Woolley","original_name":"Monty Woolley","popularity":0.2198,"profile_path":"/a6eZUY568tOA9UfE0Fdgz9iaXSo.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gantvoort","credit_id":"52fe4f16c3a36847f82bc8ad","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"G.P.
