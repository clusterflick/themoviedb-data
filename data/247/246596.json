To add insult-to-injury Willie is also the store's designated 'Fired Man.\"; when a disgruntled customer demands that somebody-must-be-fired, Willie is summoned and summarily fired, only to be rehired when the now-satisfied customer has departed. Willie inadvertently adopts a four-year-old orphan at a cost of ten-dollars a week, and things go from bad to worse since Willie doesn't make ten-dollars a week. But, with the help of Mary, a beautiful young nurse, Willie manages to turn some corners and improve his lot in life, albeit with some skids along the way.","popularity":0.2298,"poster_path":"/dMT5ViBBl4LF6ajNbMpUyvTpX9H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1930-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Work","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Quillan","original_name":"Eddie Quillan","popularity":0.3433,"profile_path":"/p49Q3UZigqHlmrQYWa2RTNh6CGv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Willie Musher","credit_id":"52fe4f17c3a36847f82bce85","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1178567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Starr","original_name":"Sally Starr","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/oPAGSceLceRUVmDkMl91GouvAOU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"52fe4f17c3a36847f82bce89","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1282051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances Upton","original_name":"Frances Upton","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/w6zYii66MDCxNGP3FYTdtqSPFNe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Aggie","credit_id":"52fe4f17c3a36847f82bce8d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Keene","original_name":"Tom Keene","popularity":0.1815,"profile_path":"/y0rkWrIWgTgN1w8FwpsgaIZlZZ0.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Harvey Vanderman","credit_id":"52fe4f17c3a36847f82bce95","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert McWade","original_name":"Robert McWade","popularity":0.143,"profile_path":"/pWD1NyVwpyG2jKAxRidjfk37xHo.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Phil Reisman","credit_id":"52fe4f17c3a36847f82bce9d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Edeson","original_name":"Robert Edeson","popularity":0.1969,"profile_path":"/qWHUMZ3pBUhoDH781Zhnon9xRqu.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Clinton J.
