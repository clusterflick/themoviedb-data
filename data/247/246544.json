Mateusz is an old-timer, a saddler, who finds nothing but hostility when he makes it home after years away. He is not a Jew, though the villagers brand him one and give him a hard time. They feel guilty about the death of his son at the end of the war, and don't want the father around. In the background: beginnings of the Communist regime in Poland.","popularity":0.2626,"poster_path":"/rRxy1RWbo8st1ZjjTu9w0WrgUZZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burial of a Potato","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Burial of Potatos","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franciszek Pieczka","original_name":"Franciszek Pieczka","popularity":0.225,"profile_path":"/evQQVohbQiQoPKKopfJbT9QwUHw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f16c3a36847f82bcbf9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Ferency","original_name":"Adam Ferency","popularity":0.4326,"profile_path":"/fuvRrHSkJcpouCdSWFQdiZIjqEl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f16c3a36847f82bcbfd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariusz Saniternik","original_name":"Mariusz Saniternik","popularity":0.0966,"profile_path":"/mu9J9wu2qEn5cGrp0ulhqSxP94Z.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f16c3a36847f82bcc01","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":587971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Jakub Kolski","original_name":"Jan Jakub Kolski","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f16c3a36847f82bcbf5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0102684","wikidata_id":"Q4375146","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rRxy1RWbo8st1ZjjTu9w0WrgUZZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"15+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
