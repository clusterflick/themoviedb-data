Kimball learned to work hard and love the gospel. Called as an apostle in 1943, Spencer worked unceasingly, despite many severe health problems. After helping troubled Saints overcome grievous sin, Elder Kimball wrote The Miracle of Forgiveness, which is a virtual textbook for those seeking spiritual healing. Called as the 12th President of the Church in 1973, Spencer adopted the mottos of \"Do It\" and \"Lengthen Your Stride.\" His love for all peoples of the earth led to the 1978 revelation allowing all worthy male Church members to receive the Priesthood.","popularity":0.1303,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":66939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trek West, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life and Teachings of the Prophet Spencer W Kimball","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2743463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spencer F.
