Force became a means to wrestle with this tension. As the discourse of a “country torn” finds its way into mainstream political analyses (for many the deep divisions in this country are not a new political reality), we should reflect on the writings of political dissidents and radicals. We should recognize the diversity of political analysis that is very much alive. The histories of armed struggle, if taken seriously, provide us with a means to think more critically about the center, and complicate its claims of moral and political right.","popularity":0.12,"poster_path":"/k80PAMOp0bJMtOzQwg37INLrtGa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114473,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Film Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Urban Crisis and the New Militants: Module 7 - Cicero March","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Urban Crisis and the New Militants: Module 7 - Cicero March","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Cicero March","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Gray","original_name":"Mike Gray","popularity":0.0876,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ba34c4c3a368664d014acd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1769638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Cottle","original_name":"Bill Cottle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ba34db925141609e013915","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491693,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Shea","original_name":"Mike Shea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67904da63479c48ccb28a638","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Gray","original_name":"Mike Gray","popularity":0.0876,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67904dc62a7aff0c3b28a13f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5195350,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jay Litvin","original_name":"Jay Litvin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67904de0ba46990f54dfe79e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3411590","wikidata_id":"Q20001382","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k80PAMOp0bJMtOzQwg37INLrtGa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
