Jamie and Kacie have been dating for four years, and are separately beginning to feel the affects of malaise and disconnect. As they drift apart from one another and struggle to bridge the gaps growing between them, Jamie begins to develop feelings for another woman. After precariously flirting with infidelity, Jamie abandons this new pursuit and attempts to salvage his relationship with Kacie, only to discover that she too has fallen for someone else.","popularity":0.8319,"poster_path":"/edSM7rq2F4DRtGQOtmM7nIWCiaH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Lovers don't break up, they tear themselves apart.","title":"Spaces and Reservations","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zach White","original_name":"Zach White","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jamie","credit_id":"54469a4f0e0a26633600b6be","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1376352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Hastings","original_name":"Taylor Hastings","popularity":0.1594,"profile_path":"/eqfTK2GmUJZzBsUKfHFn5cFzfCb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kacie","credit_id":"54469a7fc3a368216a00097e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Kobelt","original_name":"Jennifer Kobelt","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Cassandra","credit_id":"54469a8ac3a368216a000983","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1376354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arianna McGregor","original_name":"Arianna McGregor","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/5FkGqKc8zBvMAa88r5l0SxG4RdE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Laura","credit_id":"54469a9bc3a3683691002ad8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1376355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dayleigh Nelson","original_name":"Dayleigh Nelson","popularity":0.0953,"profile_path":"/PR6WhEiVGr6IUVosJD36yWm0uk.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Eli","credit_id":"54469aa5c3a36848940053b6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian McAndrew","original_name":"Ian McAndrew","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Alexander","credit_id":"54469aae0e0a26633000b70d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Laverty","original_name":"Teresa Laverty","popularity":0.1618,"profile_path":"/fOZz3cTHTCJ3s6pv6tpMCWZMAlR.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ellen","credit_id":"54469abd0e0a2661c8002ac3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1376358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Turner","original_name":"Aaron Turner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Lonnie","credit_id":"54469ace0e0a26633000b717","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1051482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brendan Prost","original_name":"Brendan Prost","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/wjXi5k4fbwvsW5mjxyDas2kDQpt.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4f13c3a36847f82bbeb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376360,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Drew Redman","original_name":"Drew Redman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54469b110e0a26633a00b7d0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2274100,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeremy Cox","original_name":"Jeremy Cox","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/kt0YbkMMHk8GTf988seJpH1sebO.jpg","credit_id":"66b96a0c806c124c0cf7057c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3383750","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mphQ35OYsZiBzwZcW2zM4D8EY2z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/edSM7rq2F4DRtGQOtmM7nIWCiaH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2487,"name":"naivety"},{"id":14602,"name":"break-up"},{"id":158651,"name":"realism"},{"id":162272,"name":"life relationship"},{"id":207860,"name":"naturalism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SPACES AND RESERVATIONS - Trailer","key":"UkMxxjbX_nA","published_at":"2014-02-15T10:32:03.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"596251cc92514122510b9b5d"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SPACES AND RESERVATIONS - Teaser","key":"a3Bw7vEcDXE","published_at":"2013-05-23T04:34:54.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"596251e69251410a590d7933"}]}}}
