With contributions from Bob Ezrin, Mick Rock, Lenny Kaye, Paul Auster, Moe Tucker, Boy George, Thurston Moore, Andrew Wylie, Victor Bockris, Holly Woodlawn, Mary Woronov and Steve Hunter.","popularity":0.2878,"poster_path":"/6YrT5eCEkjsZAqz9Jmx7CJm1x55.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Film tribute to Lou Reed, who died in October 2013, which looks at the extraordinarily transgressive life and career of one of rock 'n' roll's true originals","title":"Lou Reed - Remembered","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lou Reed","original_name":"Lou Reed","popularity":0.492,"profile_path":"/lWFiXdQtYHqr2EXnk5nhDFm36XF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (Archival footage)","credit_id":"65ccd24ce263bb018669526e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Rodley","original_name":"Chris Rodley","popularity":0.1354,"profile_path":"/68s5Da7VJ8vcoUG3b4WWyq1jRDP.jpg","credit_id":"5c6a6e559251412a74fdcdfa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3617842","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1122,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6YrT5eCEkjsZAqz9Jmx7CJm1x55.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":748},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zua8l9E67OuFywBVMTv72gRbrjM.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
