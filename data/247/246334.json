Amy took to the stage of Saint James's church, capacity 85, and wowed the small, packed crowd with a searing, acoustic set of songs from Back to Black. After leaving the stage, a relaxed and happy Amy spoke about her music and influences - Mahalia Jackson, Sarah Vaughan, Ray Charles and the Shangri-Las to name a few. Arena joined forces with Other Voices and went to Dingle to catch up with some of the people that Amy met on that day, including taxi driver Paddy Kennedy, her bass player Dale Davis and Rev Mairt Hanley of the Other Voices church. This film showcases not only Amy herself, but the musical geniuses that inspired her to forge her own jazz pop style.","popularity":0.4271,"poster_path":"/2bwtOZ0YZg9ISqMt9NfoXKf2ZXH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":17179,"logo_path":null,"name":"BBC Arena","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":214807,"logo_path":null,"name":"South Wind Blows","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amy Winehouse: At the BBC - Arena: The Day She Came to Dingle","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Amy Winehouse: The Day She Came To Dingle","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":558820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Winehouse","original_name":"Amy Winehouse","popularity":0.311,"profile_path":"/7Imqp8eqt1je4kMwJrV7WfhAZnW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f13c3a36847f82bbac3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1240392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Mac","original_name":"Annie Mac","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f13c3a36847f82bbac7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080233,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tina Moran","original_name":"Tina Moran","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65690abe89b561013809fca3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1031235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurice Linnane","original_name":"Maurice Linnane","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65690acd77c01f00eae02063","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1031235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maurice Linnane","original_name":"Maurice Linnane","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65690ad26f6a990206a4358f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1228945,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Wall","original_name":"Anthony Wall","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65690adcea84c700e4d04297","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2630202","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1132,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AaRqnIiKOs6sPhur6cFCdhnTrEo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2013}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2bwtOZ0YZg9ISqMt9NfoXKf2ZXH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":667},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mZCoyTBl5VuEfp4Yhs8x4TuXCBx.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.755,"height":1714,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rD3tZkDjyEIUw48W6vznnfsLGhQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":1294}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":283297,"name":"music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
