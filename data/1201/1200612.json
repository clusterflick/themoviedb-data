Adenomyosis is often described as the \"evil sister\" of Endometriosis - and vice versa. Two personified illnesses, that cause immense suffering and debilitating pain. Since loneliness, shame and a lack of understanding shape the lives of many affected people, the short film aims to raise awareness, break taboos and ultimately show sufferers they're not alone.","popularity":0.3106,"poster_path":"/9IZ3LVPUEjXuGrBeHSHTDHv23LN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A
