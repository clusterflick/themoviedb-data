The metaphoric body constitutes the essence of this artwork. Two narrations are conjugated in the present and in the past : one speaks of the human quest for survival and the threat of man's intervention in nature, while the other evokes a wild nature where characters and animals are emerging. Paintings of Caravagio, Della Francesca, and Douanier Rousseau overlap the two accounts.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/xQE0MAriwxFDuxLQ30OUeVlICI4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1988-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Corps d'oeuvres","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyndra Gaudreau","original_name":"Lyndra Gaudreau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"654570579cc67b00ab464021","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4356106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chantal duPont","original_name":"Chantal duPont","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rHRhFH38UUo4Mf2JAKnVRMEMq0s.jpg","credit_id":"654570669d6e3306cabb7353","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4347321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzan Vachon","original_name":"Suzan Vachon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rmTOBVtigdrQ7Ht4TCYOLL54THD.jpg","credit_id":"6545707a41a561336b771055","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4356106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chantal duPont","original_name":"Chantal duPont","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rHRhFH38UUo4Mf2JAKnVRMEMq0s.jpg","credit_id":"6545708f6beaea010b328207","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4356106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chantal duPont","original_name":"Chantal duPont","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rHRhFH38UUo4Mf2JAKnVRMEMq0s.jpg","credit_id":"6545709cfd4f8000e47ecc06","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyndra Gaudreau","original_name":"Lyndra Gaudreau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654570b19cc67b013a307123","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2956775,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pierre Dostie","original_name":"Pierre Dostie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654570c66beaea00eaf70711","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4347321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzan Vachon","original_name":"Suzan Vachon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rmTOBVtigdrQ7Ht4TCYOLL54THD.jpg","credit_id":"654570d7fd4f8000ae29e0d8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4347321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzan Vachon","original_name":"Suzan Vachon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rmTOBVtigdrQ7Ht4TCYOLL54THD.jpg","credit_id":"654570e3fd4f8000e47ecc14","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":842,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xQE0MAriwxFDuxLQ30OUeVlICI4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":568}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1988-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
