Because Chen's parents passed away, Qin Xianglian came to the capital Kaifeng with their children—Dongge and Chunmei. Chen took the first place in the imperial exam and then married to the princess. Instead of recognizing them, Chen sent his servant Han Qi to kill them for fear of being betrayed his secret. Qin told the truth to Han Qi who was so touched that he let Qin and her children go and committed suicide. Under the help of the Prime Minister Wang Yanling, Qin brought a lawsuit against Chen Shimei at government of Kaifeng. Bao Zheng called Chen Shimei to the court, intending to persuade him but failed. The Emperor's aunt and the Queen Mother came successively to Bao Zheng to prevent the execution. Finally, Bao Zheng executed Chen Shimei according to law.","popularity":0.2259,"poster_path":"/cvlrkzXle1ODMa7cQd2HK9hDqVl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Qin Xianglian","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4364165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guanglu Meng","original_name":"Guanglu Meng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"包拯/Chen Shimei","credit_id":"654b83dbfd4f80013ceb059f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4364166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xiujun Zhao","original_name":"Xiujun Zhao","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"秦香莲/Qin Xianglian","credit_id":"654b843cfd4f80011ed345c6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4364169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jun Li","original_name":"Jun Li","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"陈世美","credit_id":"654b84a029383500c47270da","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4364170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Qiang Zhu","original_name":"Qiang Zhu","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"654b84c71ac2927b2c8262a3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1470076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xiao Lang","original_name":"Xiao Lang","popularity":0.0522,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b84fb2866fa00e1f1138d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3462417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Qiu Lili","original_name":"Qiu Lili","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/2EDJ5rQvVqzEtpLrXwBchFKApnN.jpg","credit_id":"654b85101ac2927b33892360","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1696,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cvlrkzXle1ODMa7cQd2HK9hDqVl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
