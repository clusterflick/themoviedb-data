'The Pirates of Central Park,' a contemporary adaptation of the early Twentieth Century short story, 'The Pirate of the Round Pond' by Lord Dunsany, is such a story. Told through the eyes of three New York City kids whose thirst for power and adventure lead them to pursue a career as modern day pirates in the City's famous Central Park, the story poignantly contemplates the age old lesson of right versus wrong, and teach us all, young and old, that there is a high price to pay for seeking personal triumph in the malicious sinking of other people's hopes, dreams - and ships!","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pirates of Central Park","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0307328","wikidata_id":"Q7757260","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
