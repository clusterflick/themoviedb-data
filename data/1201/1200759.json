He has to assist the ewes in ewing, to control the feeding of the lambs, and to switch orphaned and abandoned lambs to ewes that have lost their lamb. This is still done by the traditional method of skinning: The dead lamb's skin is slipped on the abandoned lamb to deceive the mother ewe. At this time the shepherd must also warm newly-born, supercooled lambs inside the house and feed them artificially.","popularity":0.2109,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":209976,"logo_path":"/r7MbJrLqXWCvdLtkgi15lRDZ7mA.png","name":"Institut für den wissenschaftlichen Film (IWF)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schafzucht im schottischen Hochland - Lammzeit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4357553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Armin Prinz","original_name":"Armin Prinz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6546734e5c071b01439728d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4357563,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ludwig J.
