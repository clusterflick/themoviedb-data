Huge piles of debris and broken household items had accumulated on curbsides throughout the city, awaiting disposal. Then it snowed. These piles, the broken kinks of the comfort machine of consumerism, offer voyeuristic opportunities for incongruous art happenings. The camera collaborates with an old Toyota car, which doubles as a dolly, to photograph these found art installations offered in front yards. These random, quotidian piles transform with monster-like auras and new-found permanence. The Toyota also supplies the musique concrete soundtrack.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winter Collection","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Grenier","original_name":"Vincent Grenier","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/9Pbwc4bS0m40fU5HdQU04Iw5tmB.jpg","credit_id":"654520547719d7011c934ae1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
