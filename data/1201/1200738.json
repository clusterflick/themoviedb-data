He is the father of two sons, each named Muhammad and Abdul Rahman, and he also has a daughter named Al-Salha.  The latter was favored by her father, who brought her close to him, and began to consult her and rely on her on many matters, while Muhammad and Abdul Rahman were marginalized, in contrast to the customs and traditions of the rural world, which give preference to men over women. What distinguishes Al-Salha is that she is a mature woman, very intelligent and persistent, while her two brothers are dominated by lethargy and weak personality.  In the midst of events, the character of Bouchaib, one of the village's sons, emerges. He is a reckless person. He spends most of his time hanging around bars, scattering his father Hajj Al-Muati’s wealth left and right. This young man wants to marry Al-Salha, a request that does not receive the blessing of Hajj Lakbir or Hajj Al-Muati.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"الصالحة","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
