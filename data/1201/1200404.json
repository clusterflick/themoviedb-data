Stories from the director's childhood, together with conversations with his father, that fought in the colonial war in Africa and later was arrested, prepare the scenario for a profound reflexion on today's world. The film spirals like a snake travelling through time, an eternal recurrence, mixing documentary with film essay and autobiographical tones.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/zxosqgaMstmFxQqJaecaBigVQwP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2023-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucefece: Where there is no vision, the people will perish","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134329,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eloy Enciso","original_name":"Eloy Enciso","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656486ee706e560138c4a7ff","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1384314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Neves","original_name":"Pedro Neves","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/IDZ8fSWHojSjJ6AFGfI2N12Rq9.jpg","credit_id":"656486aa244182010cb5e5cd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3808134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricardo Leite","original_name":"Ricardo Leite","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ed72444b672d7709bddcbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21265858","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":763,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zxosqgaMstmFxQqJaecaBigVQwP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":539}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DocLisboa","release_date":"2023-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
