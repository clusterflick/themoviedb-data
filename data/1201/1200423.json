These also extend to non-reproductive life phases and partner combinations. For example, homosexual contacts and sexual contacts between young animals or with adults are frequent, and females are ready to mate throughout the menstrual cycle. Bonobos use sexual contacts not only for reproductive purposes, but also in the context of social conflicts, where they have a clear tension-reducing or peacemaking function.","popularity":0.4818,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":209976,"logo_path":"/r7MbJrLqXWCvdLtkgi15lRDZ7mA.png","name":"Institut f√ºr den wissenschaftlichen Film (IWF)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bonobo Sexual Behaviour and its Social Tension-Reducing Functions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356130,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Schorsch","original_name":"Michael Schorsch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654562327719d700adc5ad8e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356132,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bernd Fietz","original_name":"Bernd Fietz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654562f77719d70139a4ab1c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4356128,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susanne Eickhoff","original_name":"Susanne Eickhoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6545621d9cc67b00ab463c92","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356133,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Klaus Kemner","original_name":"Klaus Kemner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654563079d6e3306cb87e56d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4356128,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susanne Eickhoff","original_name":"Susanne Eickhoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6545621441a56133688300a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356131,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kuno Lechner","original_name":"Kuno Lechner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654562619cc67b00ab463cac","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14759,"name":"ape"},{"id":177280,"name":"primate"},{"id":220108,"name":"sexual behavior"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
