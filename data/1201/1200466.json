The birds speak about the frailty of the balance between culture and nature. Primitive figures which evoke Peruvian history emerge from Chantal duPont's paintings and take part in actual situations. In his flight, the eagle releases aman, only to eventually become his prisoner. From within a blaze where birds are consumed, a human form emerges. It has become both stone and archeological symbol.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/gUjl4Rakos6tJgPGd61FQdur2GA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1988-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paroles d'oiseaux à Toro Muerto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyndra Gaudreau","original_name":"Lyndra Gaudreau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"65457a32d8cc4a00ad2296bf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4356106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chantal duPont","original_name":"Chantal duPont","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rHRhFH38UUo4Mf2JAKnVRMEMq0s.jpg","credit_id":"65457a6c2866fa0138a62d7a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1372743,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bertrand Chénier","original_name":"Bertrand Chénier","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65457a5cfd4f8000c7fb880c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4356106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chantal duPont","original_name":"Chantal duPont","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rHRhFH38UUo4Mf2JAKnVRMEMq0s.jpg","credit_id":"65457a176beaea00eaf7096e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":841,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gUjl4Rakos6tJgPGd61FQdur2GA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1988-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
