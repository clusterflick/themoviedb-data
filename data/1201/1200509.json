Cyberlight, a desk lamp with a mischievous side, tries his best to initiate some connection with Sublime in the only way he can: peddling smut.  Kiffe, a moderator of the community, deals with his dark past by suppressing his most disturbing moments of moderation.  Oh, there's also the looming threat of aliens.  Gosh is a love letter to the films that inspire me and a film about dealing with intrusive thoughts and grappling with change.  A large portion of the dialogue is taken directly from topic titles and posts within lending to the surreal nature of the film.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/ouSdFclJNe5qOSJq7YVYEO8LHby.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gosh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29485488","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ouSdFclJNe5qOSJq7YVYEO8LHby.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tiZZTb6tBANkbW0VfDorHFUR8ev.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
