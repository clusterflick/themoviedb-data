For five days at Easter processions of three \"battalions\" take place symbolizing the storming, defence and conquering of barricades erected by inhabitants or local associations. The three \"battalions\" are the riflemen (responsible for taking the barricade), the farmers (responsible for defending the barricades) and the pioneers (responsible for mopping up). Two of the five processions are shown, men on Whitsun Sunday and women on the following Tuesday.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":209976,"logo_path":"/r7MbJrLqXWCvdLtkgi15lRDZ7mA.png","name":"Institut für den wissenschaftlichen Film (IWF)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schüttenhoff in Förste/Nienstedt 1989","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356159,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gerhard Matzdorf","original_name":"Gerhard Matzdorf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65456b78d8cc4a01005a3314","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356131,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kuno Lechner","original_name":"Kuno Lechner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65456b8641a561336d83cb67","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1503936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Bertram","original_name":"Klaus Bertram","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65456b951ac29200c4960e21","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356161,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hanns Weil","original_name":"Hanns Weil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65456b9e41a561336939c395","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356162,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Uwe Fanelli","original_name":"Uwe Fanelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65456bab9cc67b00fc7f5e47","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356162,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Uwe Fanelli","original_name":"Uwe Fanelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65456bb8fd4f800101b50cdb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356164,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ulrich Roters","original_name":"Ulrich Roters","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65456bc9d8cc4a01005a3331","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4356167,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rolf Wilhelm Brednich","original_name":"Rolf Wilhelm Brednich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65456c2bfd4f80011ed0403f","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Consultant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
