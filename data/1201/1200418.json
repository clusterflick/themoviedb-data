He finds work on a railroad, but soon gives his corrupt foreman Mekakis a savage beating. Making his way west across the country, Andreas eventually comes upon another railroad looking for workers. It turns out Mekakis has gone westward, too. He offers Andreas the only job suitable for him, a \"mountain mover\" on the suicide squad: He must grapple down the face of a cliff, position sticks of dynamite and then climb back up again before the lit fuses reach the explosive.","popularity":1.0544,"poster_path":"/mofmjqPcwOVf4psWlpUj7Lvf994.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":212675,"logo_path":null,"name":"Center for Television in the
