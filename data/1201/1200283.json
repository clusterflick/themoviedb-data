This vast Artemision is mentioned in several ancient texts, which even go so far as to specify the distance that separates the sanctuary from the ancient city of Eretria. But despite the efforts of numerous scientific expeditions since the end of the 19th century, no trace of the sanctuary or its temple has ever been found. In the 1960s, a young archaeologist - Denis Knoepfler - set out in search of the lost temple of Artemis. His investigations soon led him into the hinterland of the island of Euboea, well beyond the limits of previous expeditions. It would take five decades of searching, unshakeable faith and moving tons of earth to finally unravel the mystery. In 2017, a tenacious Swiss-Greek team of archaeologists formally identified the sanctuary of Artemis, where Denis Knoepfler had predicted it lay buried.","popularity":0.1685,"poster_path":"/AFskKngkRGrmTrFbtTMeF3bzwQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21530,"logo_path":"/cEJO4W8D2eXoeaWz16PC9SkjxmN.png","name":"Climage","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":16661,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARTE GEIE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2023-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Artemis - The Lost Temple","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3397714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Tobola","original_name":"Barbara Tobola","popularity":0.1157,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65451d8b1ac292013b61ef97","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Voïta","original_name":"Michel Voïta","popularity":0.1859,"profile_path":"/sSNUp70P6nAInUxR2uXv6otFz4W.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65451da57719d700adc59896","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Knoepfler","original_name":"Denis Knoepfler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65451cb02866fa00fefe5919","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvian Fachard","original_name":"Sylvian Fachard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65451cc17719d700ff8cd785","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamara Saggini","original_name":"Tamara Saggini","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65451cd07719d70139a494d6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chloé Chezeaux","original_name":"Chloé Chezeaux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65451ce4fd4f800101b4f3a4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tobias Krapf","original_name":"Tobias Krapf","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65451cf92866fa00ab1047e0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thierry Theurillat","original_name":"Thierry Theurillat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65451d0d9d6e3306cdc5e051","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angeliki G.
