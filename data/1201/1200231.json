At the intersection of Blackness and disability, the film is an artistic kaleidoscope composed of animation,illustration, poetry, and photography bending genres and flirting with experimentalism. With a colourful soundscape and cinematography to match, Wintâ€™s directorial debut floats off the screen and echos as a defiant, assured visual language. The film also depicts some of the beauty and difficulty of life in the Canadian prairies, as histories of racism and ableism mix with the beauty of the land, and the resolve of racialized communities to create a life that is at once brutal and beautiful, joyful and rugged for Black Canadians.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/UUSSrsHRuUJRN0UzgYw2ELzrRV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Body Is a Poem/The World Makes With Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brandon Wint","original_name":"Brandon Wint","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6544fdb99cc67b00c442bb2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/UUSSrsHRuUJRN0UzgYw2ELzrRV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Indie Memphis Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
