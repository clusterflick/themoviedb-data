His neighbors know him for his naivety, which he tries to hide by asserting that he is knowledgeable about everything and all topics, hence his nickname, “Bul Aqul,” by which he has become known among the neighborhood’s residents.  Hamida does not have a job to spend his day, so you find him most of the time with his friend Othman, who lives from what he gets from the price of renting a place he inherited from his father. It seems that this situation does not please Al-Tahira, Hamida’s mother, who advised her son to look for a stable job and build a family.  Hamida is very excited about the new mission..
