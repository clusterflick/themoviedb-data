This project was called \"The Heritage Initiative.\" Contrary to its name, this plan was going to eliminate the downtown's heritage by displacing 850 people from their homes as well as destroy playgrounds, vegetable gardens, and historic buildings. Moving residents out of the city and improving traffic flow was at the heart of this proposal... It was 1960's Urban Renewal all over again. As tragic as the circumstances were, the threat of a road destroying the neighborhood required residents to rise to the challenge of becoming *community organizers. This movie documents 5 years of development and community organizing in Lewiston. It's an exceptional story about the people of Lewiston, but it's also a universal story about the challenges faced by many urban neighborhoods across the United States.","popularity":0.4501,"poster_path":"/q8aWjCrv6KDxLAAM4EXQPkfVT3d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neighbor by Neighbor: Mobilizing an Invisible Community in Lewiston, Maine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Craig Saddlemire","original_name":"Craig Saddlemire","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654515e99d6e3306cb87d07f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1382306","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q8aWjCrv6KDxLAAM4EXQPkfVT3d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":161662,"name":"urban development"},{"id":163118,"name":"social justice"},{"id":298922,"name":"housing"},{"id":324527,"name":"community organizing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
