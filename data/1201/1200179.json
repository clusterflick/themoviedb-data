In a final goodbye, Sofia finds pieces that remind her of her grandmother, from poems to Super 8 films recorded in Serra da Arrábida. She searches for fragments of her childhood and testimonies of a life in a now uninhabited house. These memories are evoked through the objects and scenarios visited as the film unfolds.  Ultimately, only memories remain, small traces of life, moments.","popularity":0.045,"poster_path":"/qpIciQdd3ryZhQtYUVsUdN5KiUd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Escola Artística António Arroio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2023-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Between longing and memory, a desire to turn you eternal is born.","title":"RECORDANDO","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Braz","original_name":"Sofia Braz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sofia","credit_id":"6544dabf9cc67b00ab460f2f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristina Braz","original_name":"Cristina Braz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Voz adulta","credit_id":"6544dad941a56133693995e3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Braz","original_name":"Sofia Braz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6544dbf12866fa0138a5f52d","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355050,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mário Braz","original_name":"Mário Braz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6544dc107719d700c51f05c7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355050,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mário Braz","original_name":"Mário Braz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6544dbb29d6e3306cb87be3c","department":"Art","job":"Assistant Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4094543,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Escola Artística António Arroio","original_name":"Escola Artística António Arroio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6544db959cc67b013a303e64","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Braz","original_name":"Sofia Braz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6544dbe66beaea00c9fb24d0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Braz","original_name":"Sofia Braz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6544db7e9cc67b00c442ad62","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Braz","original_name":"Sofia Braz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6544dbc26beaea014b66e79a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Braz","original_name":"Sofia Braz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6544db5a9d6e3306c90f62d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355050,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mário Braz","original_name":"Mário Braz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654cb76c1ac2927b2c82d464","department":"Sound","job":"Foley"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4355050,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mário Braz","original_name":"Mário Braz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654cb7931ac2927b302a1b0b","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"sofiasbraz","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aEC3ngud61eQjPl8husOLww16FS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":2812,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/qpIciQdd3ryZhQtYUVsUdN5KiUd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"M/6","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
