Havel allows the filmmakers a glimpse behind the scenes of his life, revealing purely personal moments that present him in previously unrecognised contours. With a sense of humour, he reflects on his political legacy and universal human issues. The central motif is formed by the parallels between Havel's life and the successful play Leaving, which Havel always wanted to direct as a film adaptation.","popularity":0.1853,"poster_path":"/wjw5MFtGdUmzawj5wX23VeoZ3kr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24870,"logo_path":"/blj2QS49YMgKh4SGUGF27uySVRe.png","name":"Endorfilm","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech
