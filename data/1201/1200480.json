From angry missed check-ins to bizarre antics at security, to alternative safety briefings and deafening party flights and of course those near death experiences on flights from hell. What really happened? Why do we do it? And, what do those in charge say and do to try and make us safer? Aviation experts including pilots, cabin crew, psychologists and air designers give us their inside view. Join us on a shocking, surprising and very entertaining journey from check in to touchdown.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gO62iatJwLloFSJS6Ozfetku3L3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Flights From Hell: Caught on Camera explores the extremes of human behaviour in airports and on planes - the good, the bad and the just 'plane crazy'.","title":"Flights from Hell: Caught on Camera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7275166","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gO62iatJwLloFSJS6Ozfetku3L3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
