He is an obese, unattractive, and very lonely man whose only gift is to create beautiful and ironic verses. Each of its scenes is juxtaposed with a poem that adds meaning and depth to the routine act. The power of López-Carrillo's verses is such that the words take control of what unfolds on screen, turning everyday tasks into the portrait of a man abandoned by fortune, alone, and noticing his life slips away. Writing is his only refuge from despair. Through irony, the poet manages to give meaning to existence and fight, always with a bitter smile, against oblivion.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zKSKr7nImfR15s4znoay9JWJEur.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tan Sumamente Ligero","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5515313,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santiago Suárez Baldrís","original_name":"Santiago Suárez Baldrís","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68542cb11426ce9b110cf301","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zKSKr7nImfR15s4znoay9JWJEur.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
