This Bob Clearmountain mix includes three versions: Dolby Atmos, 5.1 (from the Super Audio CD (SACD) released in 2003--also by Bob Clearmountain), and the original 1982 stereo mix.  Avalon was Roxy Music's final studio album and it was released in 1982. It features Roxy Music's final UK top 10 UK single, 'More Than This'. The title track 'Avalon' was a top 20 single a few months later and the final single from the album was 'Take a Chance With Me' which reached #26. Avalon topped the UK album charts for three consecutive weeks and sold a million copies in America.  The new Atmos Mix was overseen by Bryan Ferry and the album's co-producer Rhett Davies and approved by Roxy Music. The blu-ray comes packaged in the same deluxe hardcover mediabook packaging used for the Bryan Ferry Retrospective and Thompson Twins Into The Gap releases. As ever, Avalon ships with a free, collectible SDE Surround Series slipcase.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roxy Music Avalon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
