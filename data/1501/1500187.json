Mortimer Goth, once the town’s respected intellectual, is seen dressed in a tattered Santa suit, talking to shadows, and leaving presents that explode or bleed.  Ever since Bella vanished without a trace, Mortimer’s mind has deteriorated. This Christmas, he decides to \"give back\" to the neighborhood — one corpse at a time.  Armed with a candy cane axe and an endless supply of fire hazards, Mortimer begins a murderous rampage across Pleasantview, targeting everyone from the Calientes to the Brokes. By sunrise, the snow is red.","popularity":0.2214,"poster_path":"/13NtyMszjHBMnYowi1OzwoasBXW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soprano Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Sims 2 Movie Santa's Gone Goth","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5140898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Landon Jackson","original_name":"Aaron Landon Jackson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mortimer Goth","credit_id":"6852c27fb717883dc5066336","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Cassandra Goth","credit_id":"6852c291f6bc914bb5fb5294","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5511253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Blake","original_name":"Matt Blake","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Don Lothario","credit_id":"6852c2a444c266df42066150","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852c219e730af4542efac41","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852c22289f4b76fb3312822","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852c230462b0bbc85312846","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852c23df151f24c5fec978c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852c247b14412abe37a3984","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852c2531e1c838174066154","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4456312,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jakob Chambers","original_name":"Jakob Chambers","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/aWRZimBqe2aNcMbOLJAfGXzEJrR.jpg","credit_id":"6852c26175be389621066248","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/13NtyMszjHBMnYowi1OzwoasBXW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10123,"name":"dark comedy"},{"id":12339,"name":"slasher"},{"id":164022,"name":"machinima"},{"id":186466,"name":"christmas horror"},{"id":341359,"name":"the sims"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
