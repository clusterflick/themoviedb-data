Set in the desolate ruins of the Capital Wasteland, the film explores the descent into madness of a lone survivor trapped in an abandoned metro tunnel â€” cut off from food, light, and hope.  After a supply run gone wrong, a scavenger named Joanna Creek finds herself trapped beneath the city in a collapsed metro tunnel. Her radio is dead, her flashlight battery fading, and all exits are sealed. Days pass. Hunger gnaws. Water runs out. Rats scurry, but offer no salvation.","popularity":0.2286,"poster_path":"/sdrqp8F7CysaMziYWpTJkrdtKqU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soprano Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Starved","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Joanna Creek","credit_id":"6852ad8d981b49013206612b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5512578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corrado Romanov","original_name":"Corrado Romanov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Thin Man","credit_id":"6852add75aa51a655cb6e356","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5512579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Osmund","original_name":"Irene Osmund","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Voice on the Radio","credit_id":"6852ae09fd794f59b36aedef","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852ae188e028a41cb0661bc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852ae2af151f24c5fec9708","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852ae35f59cad3545312797","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852ae4301bccf0da86aeefd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852ae509d5abc61913127ba","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852ae5b8e028a41cb0661bf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4456312,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jakob Chambers","original_name":"Jakob Chambers","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/aWRZimBqe2aNcMbOLJAfGXzEJrR.jpg","credit_id":"6852ae6b01fe91d2b45834aa","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sdrqp8F7CysaMziYWpTJkrdtKqU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1533,"name":"isolation"},{"id":50009,"name":"survival horror"},{"id":164022,"name":"machinima"},{"id":278235,"name":"cannibalism"},{"id":331200,"name":"fallout"},{"id":353736,"name":"survival instinct"},{"id":353737,"name":"psychological deterioration"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
