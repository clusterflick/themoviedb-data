June 1984 is a pivotal moment of contemporary Sikh reality that has shaped the relationship Sikhs have with their patshahi (Guru- bestowed Sikh sovereignty) and the wider world. Following June 1984, the Sikh struggle for Khalistan has impacted the Sikh people deeply and encapsulates the deep desire to embody the Sikhi (lived Sikh embodiment) of the Panth's (Sikh collective) soorme jujharoos (brave warriors). The Battle answers so many of our questions about what it means to be a Sikh of the Guru and how to confront the complex problems we are facing today as a collective.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ujply0Ty9z5zP0vS0uwbeTxyTDp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Battle of Amritsar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21062574","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1412,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ujply0Ty9z5zP0vS0uwbeTxyTDp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
