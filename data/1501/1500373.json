In an old-fashioned bathing establishment, we meet them, soft and bathrobe-clad, wherever they are in life; from the young newly in love from northern Jutland, to the childhood friends from Odsherred and the meeting between two parents with small and adult children. The surroundings encourage self care and Nordic traditions of well-being but also mirror a very old-fashioned healthcare system. In Denmark, access to treatment (such as hormones and surgery) is still limited, and often achieved through exhausting and humiliating processes. The internal sharing of knowledge, humor and care are therefore vital in transgender communities.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/3hQTVUg3qrkGvSCaSLYeHoQDiu4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68380,"logo_path":"/eOjIRK4edfDS1LRlL7KKE5t3eC8.png","name":"Den Danske Filmskole","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2025-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"As a transgender person, is it a political act to step outside your own front door?
