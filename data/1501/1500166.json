Despite warnings in their grandfather’s journal and strange symbols carved into the barn walls, Patrick insists on opening the silo.  What they find inside changes everything.  Inside is not just rot and rust, but something alive — or something pretending to be. A third presence makes itself known: The Watcher, a voice that speaks only in whispers and seems tied to the land itself.  As night falls and strange phenomena begin, the siblings realize the farm wasn’t abandoned — it was quarantined.","popularity":0.2357,"poster_path":"/jqDSxI757NYr6lPFQLwLsK0rxx6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soprano Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Old Silo Farm","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456315,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matthew Gordon","original_name":"Matthew Gordon","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Patrick Alridge","credit_id":"6852b4bbe1f49bfb8592e2fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mae Alridge","credit_id":"6852b4cb1e8943146206616f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anouska Leigh","original_name":"Anouska Leigh","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/mNcCctOA62kTwpkyiAOEyP6eDxu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Watcher","credit_id":"6852b4d9e730af4542efabda","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852b4e7714e05acb906620b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852b4ee7b78e74be192e34e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852b4f6b717883dc50662fe","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852b4fd7b78e74be192e351","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852b509cc716e82f1312797","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852b511e1ce6de412fb5169","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4456312,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jakob Chambers","original_name":"Jakob Chambers","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/aWRZimBqe2aNcMbOLJAfGXzEJrR.jpg","credit_id":"6852b52cd7103d0b7b58346f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harley Coleman","original_name":"Harley Coleman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6852b5445aa8fc392afb525e","department":"Crew","job":"Visual Effects Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jqDSxI757NYr6lPFQLwLsK0rxx6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3335,"name":"halloween"},{"id":164022,"name":"machinima"},{"id":341359,"name":"the sims"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
