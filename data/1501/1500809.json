Flashbacks trace Mora’s rise from reformist coffee planter to national leader, modernizing his family’s plantation with fair wages and new methods. Guided by love, loss, and his cautious brother-in-law, José María Montealegre, Mora builds trade ties with British merchant William Le Lacheur. In 1856, Costa Ricans defeat Walker, but cholera devastates the land. Betrayed by Montealegre, Mora is executed—like Walker—undone by ambition and history’s cruel turns.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":215935,"logo_path":"/jAhE8XYmFiEFhAfau1QcpM7pjkN.png","name":"Gramercy Park Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CR","name":"Costa Rica"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Black Gold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2486147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jose Palma","original_name":"Jose Palma","popularity":0.3595,"profile_path":"/27aw7tXkfZZW2Zdqrf3OSVzOus0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Juan Rafael Mora","credit_id":"685422a8de71c1505c79b08a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5515248,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kim Picado Gutiérrez","original_name":"Kim Picado Gutiérrez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685422075c6142bc005d8b63","department":"Production","job":"Casting Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":938961,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeremy Sheldon","original_name":"Jeremy Sheldon","popularity":2.086,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685422156fe3facb7f79b09c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125550,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Deepak Sikka","original_name":"Deepak Sikka","popularity":0.0832,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6854228d7f4d31d5e9955c82","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2486147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jose Palma","original_name":"Jose Palma","popularity":0.3595,"profile_path":"/27aw7tXkfZZW2Zdqrf3OSVzOus0.jpg","credit_id":"685422b3e9bebe120d955bc2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2439,"name":"coffee"},{"id":9672,"name":"based on true story"},{"id":15060,"name":"period drama"},{"id":192772,"name":"historical drama"},{"id":196564,"name":"costa rica"},{"id":207928,"name":"19th century"},{"id":308216,"name":"1850s"},{"id":328926,"name":"based on real person"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
