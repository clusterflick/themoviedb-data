Eight months in the making with a cast of thousands, this hour-long documentary does not shy from the truth. Staggering images of violence provide gritty realism yet the beauty of resistance shines through. Despite the repression, a multitude of voices were heard in Genoa: Landless Peruvian peasants stood side by side with Sicilian cheese farmers; national boundaries were overturned as a global body of people demanded a world built on social and environmental equality. That flame - it appears - is impossible to extinguish.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":144324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Indymedia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2002-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Genoa Red Zone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Genova: Red Zone","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4108,"name":"protest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
