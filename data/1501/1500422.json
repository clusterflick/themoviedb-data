Blending candid behind-the-scenes footage, brief live performance clips, and the band’s signature offbeat humor, the film captures the chaotic energy and personality that defined Every Time I Die’s early years. More than a traditional concert film, Party Pooper serves as a raw, irreverent snapshot of the band’s touring lifestyle and the metalcore scene of the mid-2000s.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Party Pooper","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5513816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Buckley","original_name":"Jordan Buckley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Sneaky Pete","credit_id":"685336f54dbc8485945b78d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5513819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Buckley","original_name":"Keith Buckley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Professor Wino","credit_id":"6853370e6806b941dcc100aa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5513820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Newton","original_name":"Josh Newton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Lord Huffinton","credit_id":"68533728f3c40203d679ad92","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5513822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Williams","original_name":"Andy Williams","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"The Admiral","credit_id":"68533747bb81c493c20cf00c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5513823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Novak","original_name":"Mike Novak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"The Invisible Man","credit_id":"6853375ca1fabc54641c0af3","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":101595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Doug Spangenberg","original_name":"Doug Spangenberg","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68533619fb033761961c0c86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1435794,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anderson Bradshaw","original_name":"Anderson Bradshaw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685336290461fc648b5d85ce","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5513803,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeff Abarta","original_name":"Jeff Abarta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6853363f15c46c3ae225684f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5513805,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Daley","original_name":"John Daley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68533656c8aacef82e60b52c","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5513806,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick Grimaldi","original_name":"Nick Grimaldi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68533663febac0942b0cf01f","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":101595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Doug Spangenberg","original_name":"Doug Spangenberg","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6853367be5c82ceb785d853a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3357723,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Allan Hessler","original_name":"Allan Hessler","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685336ab4dbc8485945b78cf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5513808,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Steve Evetts","original_name":"Steve Evetts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685336b63681491eb11c0ae0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1419193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick O'Shea","original_name":"Rick O'Shea","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"685336cc0d89251fb35504c6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Every Time I Die \"Party Pooper\" DVD Trailer","key":"4bPzioSHWvY","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2009-08-11T18:45:36.000Z","id":"685335fa29b21c02b4550429"}]}}}
