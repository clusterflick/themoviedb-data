With rare intimacy and nuance, the film offers a raw and emotional portrayal of growing up in the shadow of social exclusion, gang violence, and systemic neglect.  At the heart of the story are Elmedina, a gifted young singer struggling against family pressure and cultural expectations; Adam, a brilliant but restless teen whose hacking spirals into serious consequences; and Alex, a boy drawn into crime while trying to protect his younger sister. Guiding them is Filip, a youth center worker acting as mentor, friend, and lifeline.  More than just a documentary, this is a vital and timely story about vulnerability, choices, and resilience in the face of a society that often looks the other way.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":197762,"logo_path":null,"name":"Docster","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You die when you're young","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1396665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Pontus Hjorthén","original_name":"Carl Pontus Hjorthén","popularity":0.1202,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6852d7d99664a2f1ccefac04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1396665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Pontus Hjorthén","original_name":"Carl Pontus Hjorthén","popularity":0.1202,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6852d7e35e30a755e8fb51f2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1545273,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hjalmar Palmgren","original_name":"Hjalmar Palmgren","popularity":0.044,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6852d7f05e0a818692efab8c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421836,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kalle Gustafsson Jerneholm","original_name":"Kalle Gustafsson Jerneholm","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6852d81220750e25d0b6e5af","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2115753,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ian Person","original_name":"Ian Person","popularity":0.1892,"profile_path":"/yqSkOUk2TB0a6O5232bZEPWWN6t.jpg","credit_id":"6852d82083ea2ff0fc7a39c8","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1545272,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Camilla Skagerström","original_name":"Camilla Skagerström","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6852d82bf94045a65e92e3e9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2546610,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nora Agapi","original_name":"Nora Agapi","popularity":0.1237,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6852d83438a8963ccdfb51fc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2602453,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Frans Hutha-Karlsson","original_name":"Frans Hutha-Karlsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6852d83f83ea2ff0fc7a39cb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2534290,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Henrik Hjort","original_name":"Henrik Hjort","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6852d84abc97992f45b6e499","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
