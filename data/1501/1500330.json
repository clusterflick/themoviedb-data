His melancholic melodies blend with archival audio of Patrice Lumumba, whose words remain strikingly relevant today. Anga’s reflection, “Everything fell apart when Lumumba was gone,” anchors the film, highlighting the enduring impact of neocolonial powers on Africa. Yet, amidst the sorrow, the film offers a message of resilience and hope, captured in the enduring phrase “a luta continua,” the fight continues.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Luta Continua // Ataraxy 44","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2585062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Curtis Essel","original_name":"Curtis Essel","popularity":0.0616,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6852fcfbea66f226b25d8552","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
