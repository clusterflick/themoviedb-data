But the camera catches what he won’t admit — that his obsession isn’t with love, but with the idea of being seen as great.  As Alexander's online persona grows more unhinged, hallucinations blur with reality. He records performative breakdowns, fakes emotional confessions, and eventually spirals into a monologue where his reflection mocks him.","popularity":0.1786,"poster_path":"/aR7MjaF4tgHflY1tHGJJuIdeg0x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soprano Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alexander Not So Great","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5512983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladamir Abramov","original_name":"Vladamir Abramov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Alexander","credit_id":"6852e2f3fb97d5472079ac3c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Voice / Reflection","credit_id":"6852e304cb1e6749e779ac32","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852e3163c8ca5430f550301","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852e31d24545a970c5502b6","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5512983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladamir Abramov","original_name":"Vladamir Abramov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6852e3299b230467c95b7811","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852e337805267315873de30","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852e345f36498f4c860b2cf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852e34c20f62816e25b77f2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5105020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alvin Soprano","original_name":"Alvin Soprano","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/jKdng0cHa2RZcQz5mDGRNW2B6vi.jpg","credit_id":"6852e35a6f32db2c0d5502b3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Gordon","original_name":"Matthew Gordon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6852e3755b0657b317d814ef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456322,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adara Pemberton","original_name":"Adara Pemberton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6852e3895c6142bc005d846b","department":"Art","job":"Location Scout"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harley Coleman","original_name":"Harley Coleman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6852e39be5c82ceb785d845d","department":"Crew","job":"Visual Effects Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aR7MjaF4tgHflY1tHGJJuIdeg0x.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5857,"name":"narcissism"},{"id":14602,"name":"break-up"},{"id":34042,"name":"self-doubt"},{"id":176834,"name":"social media"},{"id":327925,"name":"dissociation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
