Bringing together dance, acrobatics, live video, filmed sequences and animation, the show takes spectators on a fantastic voyage through the history of cinema and its genres, taking them into the heart of the movie-making process. From illustration to animation, black and white to colour, silent films to talkies, fixed shots to swooping camera movements, spectators witness the poetic construction/deconstruction of this art as an object and as a way of transcending reality.","popularity":0.1987,"poster_path":"/hjYFVG6oxTpPeLEpR4A8Bd6tfuW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cirque du Soleil Images","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Journey through the World of Cinema","title":"Cirque du Soleil: IRIS","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1529536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gilkey","original_name":"John Gilkey","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/h2YyqgCcpYPIN9d3EamEnC8Pbvz.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Clown","credit_id":"6035367638e510003e3b620b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2988908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ekaterina Pirogovskaya","original_name":"Ekaterina Pirogovskaya","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/1jS1Iec0IF9xpQIoIE3xGVY9tk.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Praxinoscope / Violet","credit_id":"6035db0f223e200040039bba","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1529510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Pikhienko","original_name":"Olga Pikhienko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Scarlett (Hand Balancing)","credit_id":"603dc2d14d6791002ac7b8f8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raphael Cruz","original_name":"Raphael Cruz","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Buster","credit_id":"64c0745dede1b000e50ccd81","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2988354,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Nathalie Gagné","original_name":"Nathalie Gagné","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c073112f1be000ca269359","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13838,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jean Rabasse","original_name":"Jean Rabasse","popularity":0.0884,"profile_path":"/zeWBST0Oh44hdbwRGKUFIbJ3xCg.jpg","credit_id":"64c0725113a3200139f06ba9","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":531,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Danny Elfman","original_name":"Danny Elfman","popularity":0.8496,"profile_path":"/bcpur9bF56nLxzFzZowipA2wZhy.jpg","credit_id":"5ebb6cd20cb3350020d5f627","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Decouflé","original_name":"Philippe Decouflé","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/45xWeilwtde7PQ7kenOw8WHpIwU.jpg","credit_id":"5ebb6d09c3514c0020626f27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2636644,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Daphné Mauger","original_name":"Daphné Mauger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebb6d6d614c6d001d8ecbbd","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2338211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-François Bouchard","original_name":"Jean-François Bouchard","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebb6d25cc277c001f6c5ba9","department":"Production","job":"Director of Operations"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philippe Decouflé","original_name":"Philippe Decouflé","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/45xWeilwtde7PQ7kenOw8WHpIwU.jpg","credit_id":"6035365ca14e10003ecfb3fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2902501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Rudd","original_name":"David Rudd","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603535eeeec5b5003d19d38c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2358493,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles F.
