Alone in the city of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, with a journalist job at Le Courrier Picard which bores him to death, Thomas tries to get over his depression. Right at this time, he is offered the task of writing a profile piece on Usé, a major local figure, an atypical musician and former candidate at the municipal elections. While cross-crossing the city and exploring Usé's life, and while revelling in a drunken night together, the two men will learn to get to know each other.","popularity":0.1524,"poster_path":"/2Yl1W19gYmU6PkWqFIxb4vxJrld.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48774,"logo_path":"/33pdxuHxbiFGmWPNH6RzJsAHdtL.png","name":"Envie de
