Filomena is only 24 years old and recounts with a lucidity that takes her breath away her journey as a child locked up in boarding school, ran away from home, taken back by her family and treated as a lost woman. She talks about her marriage to a boy who emigrated to Germany, and her inability to adapt to this new situation. She narrates the arrival in Milan, the meeting with Antonio and the one with drugs. A dialogue for two voices traces the ruthless picture of drug addiction, the daily search for the dose and the attempts to get out of it. It is a poignant document, above all for the lucidity, measure, maturity and intelligence of two unforgettable figures.","popularity":0.4986,"poster_path":"/pmVRJXPlla5BzReq0Z6VZfCLqsU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1976-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Storia di Filomena e Antonio: Gli anni '70 e la droga a Milano","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1987771,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alessandro Zanon","original_name":"Alessandro Zanon","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62069385af2da8004239f9cf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1850560,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antonello Branca","original_name":"Antonello Branca","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebb08c90cb335001fcdc779","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1850560,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antonello Branca","original_name":"Antonello Branca","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60056b4b63e6fb003f038888","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1850560,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antonello Branca","original_name":"Antonello Branca","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60056b56f9a3fb003e36674a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1248242","wikidata_id":"Q22078270","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ql5dTEldJa4DKaPRX8otlqxACC7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1094,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pmVRJXPlla5BzReq0Z6VZfCLqsU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":730}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2671,"name":"heroin"},{"id":1803,"name":"drug addiction"},{"id":2375,"name":"junkie"},{"id":6782,"name":"addiction"},{"id":14964,"name":"drugs"},{"id":253885,"name":"milan, italy"},{"id":269726,"name":"cautionary tale"},{"id":295694,"name":"drug addict"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Storia di Filomena e Antonio: gli anni'70 e la droga a Milano\" (1/3) di Antonello Branca (1976)","key":"ywuTPQJigpk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-12-19T03:10:20.000Z","id":"6384ec442e069702a8048213"}]}}}
