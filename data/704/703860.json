His two best friends are Big Bang and Horace. Big Bang is more of a kid scientist, who is always creating new gadgets for Kid to try out. He is very intelligent for his age. Horace is more naive compared to the other two, and has a very bizarre appetite. He's always very supportive of Kid and looks up to him. As is typical for young children, Kid often fights with his sister, Carol, who finds her brother to be a degenerate air-head.","popularity":0.1288,"poster_path":"/z35AKj0MboBLuh6jecRqGKhHMem.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106612,"logo_path":"/ygHUNIBl4C8KjYI25iDVOtdaGwr.png","name":"Superprod","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":20338,"logo_path":"/yCTqaPPzFfjqKU2YAGWce4qQk1S.png","name":"Bidibul Productions","origin_country":"LU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"The game is not over just yet","title":"Kid Paddle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kev Adams","original_name":"Kev Adams","popularity":0.7256,"profile_path":"/jTqAH5n7CfPkolBIe0Bp6AfPYhZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kid Paddle","credit_id":"5ebc93558e2e000021109291","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1719924,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean-Luc Cano","original_name":"Jean-Luc Cano","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebc92f04c259200222a7b90","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2108238,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Soussan","original_name":"David Soussan","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebc93068586780021e1efc6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kev Adams","original_name":"Kev Adams","popularity":0.7256,"profile_path":"/jTqAH5n7CfPkolBIe0Bp6AfPYhZ.jpg","credit_id":"5ebc93248586780020e1c654","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2917608,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Midam","original_name":"Midam","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/uh7asxtxMqGcCTpqmT5S5lvJ7zi.jpg","credit_id":"5fed6c8f9a358d0040248141","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q934530","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.734,"height":896,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z35AKj0MboBLuh6jecRqGKhHMem.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":658}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
