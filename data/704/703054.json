The Burton production was recorded in live performance from 17 camera angles and edited into a film that was shown as a special event for only two days in nearly 1,000 movie houses across the U.S. The idea of bringing a live theater experience to thousands of simultaneous viewers in different cities was trumpeted as a new form called “Theatrofilm,” made possible through “the miracle of Electronovision.” The Wooster Group attempts to reverse the process, reconstructing a hypothetical theater piece from the fragmentary evidence of the edited film.  We channel the ghost of the legendary 1964 performance, descending into a kind of madness, intentionally replacing our own spirit with the spirit of another.","popularity":0.3009,"poster_path":"/o7ux57sA0upoc7y677eVRH4N2pg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118622,"logo_path":"/mgblq6fFxCbZH8DfmdRKro6NToV.png","name":"The Wooster Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hamlet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1475960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Shepherd","original_name":"Scott Shepherd","popularity":0.5094,"profile_path":"/leLuJUpF6uySDWPS7FwHpObAMs4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hamlet","credit_id":"5eba08910cb3350021cf85c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":285917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ari Fliakos","original_name":"Ari Fliakos","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/lQebKFgupSO0isRtrWUz5oEsjuE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Claudius/Osric/Marcellus/Ghost/Gravedigger","credit_id":"5eba08b7c3514c002060099f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Valk","original_name":"Kate Valk","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":"/8LOCLOCyDYq6ubAidVL40Cowv8r.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gertrude/Ophelia","credit_id":"5eba08c7c3514c001f5a00f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koosil-ja","original_name":"Koosil-ja","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nurse","credit_id":"5eba08db511d09001fd56134","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321564,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alessandro Magania","original_name":"Alessandro Magania","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Bernardo/Voltemand","credit_id":"5eba08f4c3514c0020600a0b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Mehrten","original_name":"Greg Mehrten","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Polonius","credit_id":"5eba0913c3514c0020600a42","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":215356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Pettrow","original_name":"Daniel Pettrow","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Horatio/Rosencrantz/Guildenstern/Player Queen","credit_id":"5eba0939bbe1dd002187679e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1333692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Casey Spooner","original_name":"Casey Spooner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Laertes/Rosencrantz/Guildenstern/Player King","credit_id":"5eba094cc3514c0020600acb","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elizabeth LeCompte","original_name":"Elizabeth LeCompte","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":"/m81g4Lv5EIuDtSMLBIPSecdA5YN.jpg","credit_id":"5eba06d9cc277c001f6b2cb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635068,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fischerspooner","original_name":"Fischerspooner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eba0961bbe1dd002085145c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":778,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o7ux57sA0upoc7y677eVRH4N2pg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":515}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"HAMLET - part two","key":"139960690","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-09-21T17:14:32.000Z","id":"5eba0ab7c3514c001e5c8a34"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"HAMLET - part one","key":"139742053","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2015-09-18T19:55:39.000Z","id":"5eba0a87cc277c0021719284"}]}}}
