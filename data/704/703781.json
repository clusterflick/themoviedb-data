Last summer, Illinois was confronting a series of bizarre murders. At each crime scene, police found a sketch of a house which turned out to be the location of the next murder. But detectives couldn't identify the houses in time, and the murders continued, becoming more violent until someone recognizes the latest sketch as the old Wilson farm up in Monroe.
