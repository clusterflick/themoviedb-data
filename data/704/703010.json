While earlier films were devoted to crushing the established hierarchy of surfing, now their crew was the established hierarchy, dominating competition, freesurfing and the media. Kelly Slater was world champ, with Dorian, Machado and Knox all hovering around the top 10 competitive slots. Even the bands involved with the films were riding the wave, and Good Times film release evolved into a full rock-n-roll tour with Pennywise, Sprung Monkey and Blink-182. As the name suggests...it really was a good time.","popularity":0.168,"poster_path":"/dMDqejl5AyijL2pnZVWjKkLHxkg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Times","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taylor Steele","original_name":"Taylor Steele","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":"/8KKuvDu84TEpyUiMcUaTw7WpBP.jpg","credit_id":"60626e52a1a9ba0028741bb4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1332,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dMDqejl5AyijL2pnZVWjKkLHxkg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":884}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
