I play with superimpositions, with drawing and scratching on the film, and layering over the camera images with texture and color. The result is a rather rhythmic, physical, playful event intended simply to happen as you watch it. The actual imagery of objects in a museum gallery, seen frequently throughout, was footage shot in the Colby College Museum of art in the 1960s.\" â€”Abbott Meader","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":"/cf2k6zKc32iEdjgqaO0AJmMLZ1o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gallery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2409926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abbott Meader","original_name":"Abbott Meader","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/6w2FYubuteabfg5UVNDEHraRTve.jpg","credit_id":"5eba598ecc277c0021722d07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cf2k6zKc32iEdjgqaO0AJmMLZ1o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Gallery (16mm silent)","key":"417330626","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-05-11T19:36:39.000Z","id":"5ec1d32ccdf2e600224f370e"}]}}}
