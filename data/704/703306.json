Combining poetic imagery with powerful readings, it evokes Allison's childhood in the poor white American South of the 1950's, her birth as a writer and feminist, and her coming to terms with a family legacy of incest and abuse. A beautifully realized portrait of an artist and survivor, this stirring film provides important insights into the roots of self-renewal and creativity.","popularity":0.0537,"poster_path":"/eRIgXYP2exnHm7UEtNYY3WjlX2o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2 or 3 Things But Nothing for Sure","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Two or Three Things But Nothing for Sure","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2847519,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dorothy Allison","original_name":"Dorothy Allison","popularity":0.0819,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63c46094595a5600865cbfff","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1097159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jane C.
