While he is becoming a lawyer and making his way up the ladder of success with the help of a political boss, the wife he left behind (Eleanor Woodruff) remains destitute and is forced to give up her child to an orphanage. The girl is adopted and grows up (played as an adult by Virginia Pearson) to become the secretary to an honest young lawyer. But the girl has the same quirk that her father had, and it causes her to steal a bracelet at a department store. She is arrested and finds herself before her father, who is now a judge.","popularity":0.2998,"poster_path":"/sR2o3N23o9qiQVKjPVK4PCO6GCX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037891,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward José","original_name":"Edward José","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":"/m32j3Z59YNNRdY2jg2xWNOMdsF3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Stevens (later The Judge)","credit_id":"5eba14c1511d09001fd571dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thurlow Bergen","original_name":"Thurlow Bergen","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":"/9WsNFheX9cUiSImll7gcPN9PJpU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Young Lawyer","credit_id":"5eba14c7c3514c001e5c9c38","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Pearson","original_name":"Virginia Pearson","popularity":0.1038,"profile_path":"/5zNG6IdLbUZzZb1Howmj9W9tM8c.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Stevens' Daughter","credit_id":"5eba14cd0cb335001fccfc6f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1197560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleanor Woodruff","original_name":"Eleanor Woodruff","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/iF5wckJWrVHNj19T0lunDqhzTrL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Stevens' Wife","credit_id":"5eba14d3bbe1dd0022836656","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2133615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam J.
