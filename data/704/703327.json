It is here, in Rojava, in three destroyed cities, that three separate stories tell the story of how savage war destroys not only our cities, but our people, too. Sinjar, Kobanî and Jazaa are three towns that display the most destructive impact of modern war. All three are in the process of being rebuilt at the moment. The people who live here have transformed their tragedies into a determination to leave a better Rojava for future generations.","popularity":0.1158,"poster_path":"/wGunXVL8WuGk7G9H7jZHf9KhUCF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117452,"logo_path":"/s7yaytdu7toSThimkafGIwXbT3b.png","name":"Komîna Fîlm a Rojava","origin_country":"SY"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"},{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"}],"release_date":"2016-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stories of Destroyed Cities","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","title":"Çîroka Bajarên Wêrankirî","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2636173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sîham Silemantanî","original_name":"Sîham Silemantanî","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ebb02040cb3350021d0bce3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2636174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adil Ebu Abdo","original_name":"Adil Ebu Abdo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ebb020ec3514c001e5db8e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2636175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ehmed îbrahim","original_name":"Ehmed îbrahim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ebb0219bbe1dd0020863bd7","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2636176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shêro Hindê","original_name":"Şêro Hindê","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/kCRJxZhonQIKOHBy8YJOJgN5NHV.jpg","credit_id":"5ebb02287d2bc1001e005286","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40028,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Önder Çakar","original_name":"Önder Çakar","popularity":0.0599,"profile_path":"/vCUdpOmp2X1wmW587UawOL7LkXw.jpg","credit_id":"5ebb0234c3514c002061abea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2636177,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mazdek Ararat","original_name":"Mazdek Ararat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebb027a7d2bc1001d032262","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2636178,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Diyar Hesso","original_name":"Diyar Hesso","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/z95ogZDPcUgyozdXzW3zSG3SxJ5.jpg","credit_id":"5ebb0287c3514c002061ac33","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/58lWcw0FspJyOG3QwJpuaEicbGf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wGunXVL8WuGk7G9H7jZHf9KhUCF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":556},{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":854,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zYkjVdJ1qCm8R0vxGiz55xMBas.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
