In the Buenos Aires of 1978, his life is in danger. The threats after one of his articles in the newspaper and his own inner conflicts push him to run away. But crossing the border is impossible. He comes back to a village near the frontier, where he stays at Father Gabriel's, a priest with ideas and attitudes of mind far from the traditional church. There he will meet Marina and Margarita, who will complete this human group with strong convictions. His stay there will be a definitive experience.","popularity":0.245,"poster_path":"/d6zztqcGhZmJ8IYy0YzSIOouXhJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Close to the Border","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulises Dumont","original_name":"Ulises Dumont","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":"/naaU4sKdEmYPv192AGkfe5PIjaj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Padre Gabriel","credit_id":"5ebb40eb1dbc88001bda2784","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1017581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Víctor Laplace","original_name":"Víctor Laplace","popularity":0.2241,"profile_path":"/pqo3Jq4S1TMt0qLXL82EiD9iQnJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mario","credit_id":"5ebb40ffaad9c2002122c98d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Gallardou","original_name":"Claudio Gallardou","popularity":0.5705,"profile_path":"/1FbD8WozWQv8VTlW0cEVyk606lv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Esteban","credit_id":"5ebb4110614c6d001d8e5873","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonor Manso","original_name":"Leonor Manso","popularity":0.173,"profile_path":"/9yf4r5tXZNLssehxIeoD0HwWhO4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Margarita","credit_id":"5ebb411f1dbc88001ad9f6ed","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2431165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santiago Beltrán","original_name":"Santiago Beltrán","popularity":0.1952,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebb4169aad9c2001f22f5ed","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266617,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gabriel E.
