The media warn that a dangerous meteorite will soon sweep near the Earth at great speed. But the wealthy restaurateur Vadim does not care, so he does not change his plans and hurries to celebrate the purchase of a new establishment. On the way to the restaurant, Vadim calls his friend Nina to invite her to a banquet.
