Long ago, a handsome young Prince lived in a magnificent castle. Though he enjoyed a life of riches, he was rude and unkind to his subjects. One fateful day, an old beggar woman approached him. Because his heart was cold, the selfish Prince turned the poor woman away. To the Prince’s surprise, the woman then transformed into a beautiful enchantress. She put a curse on the Prince for his ugly behavior, turning him into an equally ugly beast. The Enchantress’ curse could only be broken by one thing – a true love’s kiss.","popularity":0.0542,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beauty & the Beast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1869682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amelia Fischer","original_name":"Amelia Fischer","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5eba2096bbe1dd002283722f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Remi Nakano","original_name":"Remi Nakano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Belle","credit_id":"5eba20bfc3514c001e5cad4a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Cruz Alvarez","original_name":"Adrian Cruz Alvarez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Beast/Prince","credit_id":"5eba20d7bbe1dd002085369e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armando Luna","original_name":"Armando Luna","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Merchant","credit_id":"5eba20e5cc277c002171c7c3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadyne Bispo","original_name":"Nadyne Bispo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Enchantress","credit_id":"5eba20f6c3514c00206040ec","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spencer Wetherington","original_name":"Spencer Wetherington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Gaston","credit_id":"5eba2114cc277c002171c84b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635136,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gennadi Nedvigin","original_name":"Gennadi Nedvigin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eba1ff50cb3350020d3a94a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365810,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Léo Delibes","original_name":"Léo Delibes","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/hRByHwU8X7PxpN5AotVpYYkJalt.jpg","credit_id":"5eba200e0cb335001fcd078d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635138,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bruce Wells","original_name":"Bruce Wells","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eba202e7d2bc1001d01a578","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635138,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Bruce Wells","original_name":"Bruce Wells","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eba2046511d090021d54bd5","department":"Art","job":"Conceptual Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635139,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ryan Sbaratta","original_name":"Ryan Sbaratta","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eba2060cc277c00206df73d","department":"Crew","job":"Scenic Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2635140,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Joseph R.
