It's the story of an 'average gay male's' panic-stricken run through the city streets after learning that he is HIV-positive. It's also a comedy. Really. Shot in just two days with a budget of just two thousand dollars, 600 feet of b&w 16mm film on a Russian hand-crank camera, with no filming permit and a skeleton crew. Ed Wood would have been proud.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/7MepbBRyqfmjp0fjqiAi2pGcGXI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Run, Johnny","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom E.
