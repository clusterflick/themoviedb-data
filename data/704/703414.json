Trenches, emplacements and underground caverns along the Isonzo give us a mere taste of the vehemence and cruelty with which the war was conducted here. Its common history has made the region a transnational place of remembrance for many European peoples.This fascinating documentary searches for the traces and asks to what extent the events of the First World War, now almost 100 years ago, still shape the identity of the region and its people today.","popularity":0.0393,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Isonzo: The War In The Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
