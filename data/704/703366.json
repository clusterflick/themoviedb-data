The mothers turn to a group of doulas for support through pregnancy, labor and separation from their newborns; and they help each other cope with loss and guilt. This rare, intimate look behind the walls of a women's prison raises questions about how our nation is handling the growing crisis of incarcerated mothers-and the children who must start their lives without them.","popularity":0.1228,"poster_path":"/bJrYtcC0sd9E9dAlWEp3ViJ8Wgo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133799,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Marshall
