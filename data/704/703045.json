Months after winning his gold medal, Rulon's toe was amputated from severe frostbite after a near-death wilderness stranding in sub-zero temperatures. Then with 9 toes - and after surviving a near-fatal motorcycle accident, Rulon won another medal at the next Olympics, only to survive a plane crash by swimming two miles in a freezing lake. Finally, after ballooning to 500 lbs., Rulon won America's heart competing on a season of The Biggest Loser only to lose his life savings and retreat into obscurity after getting swindled in a real estate deal that cost him his Olympic medals.","popularity":1.1872,"poster_path":"/bmU4DuFbrkYhSgHxxZgZe8B3PPf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52242,"logo_path":"/fZK0w7ghcoqMlLa28LNCoZLCnj5.png","name":"Mandalay Sports
