Unbeknownst to him while he is at sea, a bitter rival kidnaps her and makes it look as though she left him willingly. When he returns and discovers their home abandoned, he all but goes mad with bitterness and rage, destroying their home. In the years that follow, Larson becomes a sadistic, drunken reprobate of the sea, working for smugglers carrying all kinds of illegal cargo, including drugs -- and human cargo.","popularity":0.165,"poster_path":"/yu0cT43fQXQJAxoO99MRy4IXPzX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47676,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emory Johnson Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Non-Stop Flight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Knute Erickson","original_name":"Knute Erickson","popularity":0.1317,"profile_path":"/oxz1kvBuAvFUuedCjmQx1nc8Iii.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lars Larson","credit_id":"5ebae506c3514c001e5d9ec2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1351812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcella Daly","original_name":"Marcella Daly","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Anna Larson","credit_id":"5ebae50c0cb3350020d4fbe4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2636017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Fry","original_name":"Virginia Fry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Marie Larson","credit_id":"5ebae5127d2bc1001e002d27","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Dunbar","original_name":"David Dunbar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Captain Karl Kruger","credit_id":"5ebae518c3514c001e5d9f0a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Hemphill","original_name":"Frank Hemphill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jan Johnson","credit_id":"5ebae5200cb335001fcdb2f4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1429397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harlan Hilton","original_name":"Harlan Hilton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Commander Roger Davis","credit_id":"6196752ebc2cb30090ca2575","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3315032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecil Ogden","original_name":"Cecil Ogden","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Lt.
