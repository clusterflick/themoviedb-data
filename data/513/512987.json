Living with injustice and oppression, many African-Americans advocated a non-violent resistance. Williams took a different tack, urging the oppressed to take up arms. Williams was stripped of his rank as leader of the local NAACP chapter, but he continued to encourage local African-Americans to carry weapons as a means of self-defense. Wanted on a kidnapping charge, Williams and his wife fled to Cuba. His radio show Radio Free Dixie could be heard in some parts of the United States.","popularity":0.4146,"poster_path":"/6IevkfPCW031fid14kJ6cu9AHpa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102366,"logo_path":null,"name":"California Newsreel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Negroes with Guns: Rob Williams and Black Power","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2003150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert F.
