Through a diverse mix of film styles, the director combines the personal and the political through a gentle first-person narration. Relating the experience of globalised and marginalised identities the world over, Shapeshifters beautifully portrays the yearning for a fixed and stable identity, while wholeheartedly embracing the internationalist spirit that transcends the borders implicit in such an identity. Always on the cusp of two or more cultures, Vuković examines the lasting effects of one generation’s choice to migrate on the next.","popularity":0.0503,"poster_path":"/6UYOH6aZLU4umKkB4sHi3ElXCTH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shapeshifters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2002645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Vukovic","original_name":"Sophie Vukovic","popularity":0.0632,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab034d19251416af70004ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2002645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Vukovic","original_name":"Sophie Vukovic","popularity":0.0632,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab034da9251416b06000488","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6875152","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4mV2bO1SQfsDL334yntPPYWtGeM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/6UYOH6aZLU4umKkB4sHi3ElXCTH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/9XVib5wjvsNePk1IlRbIPsB7ihw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Shapeshifters - trailer","key":"-38xQj6hyUo","published_at":"2017-10-20T10:28:20.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"5ab035fac3a36835f3000607"}]}}}
