Patella infuses the work of the artists from the arte povera movement with touches of surrealism, as tinted monochromatic footage of these exhibitions/actions lends them a silent film aesthetic. The title refers to the last names of the main players: gallery owner Fabio Sargentini and artists Jannis Kounellis, Eliseo Mattiacci, Pino Pascali and Luca Maria Patella himself. Kounellis is shown using the gallery as a studio, dying bits of cloth among live animals; Mattiacci engages passerby in a happening on the city streets; Patella and Rosa Foschi are shown in a similar scenario to Terra Animata, with a flag performance in a landscape; and Pascali executes a bizarre ritual on the beach, covered to his neck in sand and later planting whole loaves of bread.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/6Z2ojmYdN6qcgkqWjKckfIFtqz7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1968-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SKMP2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2851632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabio Sargentini","original_name":"Fabio Sargentini","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"644c72d8726fb127a20641b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2734033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jannis Kounellis","original_name":"Jannis Kounellis","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"644c72e9336e0102fb73b3b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2734041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eliseo Mattiacci","original_name":"Eliseo Mattiacci","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"644c72f6336e01283a73b354","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2734044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pino Pascali","original_name":"Pino Pascali","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"644c730551a64e088adda2e0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2000440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Maria Patella","original_name":"Luca Maria Patella","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"644c730f2d37210549010aa7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2420117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosa Foschi","original_name":"Rosa Foschi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65daca6c05b549017b16f21e","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2420117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosa Foschi","original_name":"Rosa Foschi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dacaf6ae281101634bf979","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2000440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Maria Patella","original_name":"Luca Maria Patella","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dacad39b6e47018600222a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203211,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aldo Raparelli","original_name":"Aldo Raparelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dacb101750510187f9217b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2000440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Maria Patella","original_name":"Luca Maria Patella","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aad481ec3a36846c9014e26","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1411,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Z2ojmYdN6qcgkqWjKckfIFtqz7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":940}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"L’Attico in via Cesare Beccaria 22","release_date":"1968-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
