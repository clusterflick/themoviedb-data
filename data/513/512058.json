What's missing is their own child, so they decide to work on it. How? They ask Louis' sister Svenja for being their surrogate mother. The film tells the meeting of the three to do the insemination between Robert and Svenja during a warm summer night in 1999 - but surprisingly Svenja brings her new boyfriend Ulf along, who does not know anything. An explosive mixture, even more since Svenja seems not to be the most reliable person and nothing turns out to be as Louis' had planned.","popularity":0.1178,"poster_path":"/A4IFuaNElO6RcEU3dFCJEcxCUb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":211897,"logo_path":null,"name":"Connor Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sorry Guys","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":33682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Borgmann","original_name":"Sandra Borgmann","popularity":0.4392,"profile_path":"/e8cMnQa6eYei6W315PgoLY5W3GK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Svenja","credit_id":"653891b1ae3668014da65166","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1813421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentin Schreyer","original_name":"Valentin Schreyer","popularity":0.0824,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"653891bfe93e9500aedb6e41","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1820965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jörg Westphal","original_name":"Jörg Westphal","popularity":0.1123,"profile_path":"/pgge5GTjat0CAuqPGhG1oISkNKJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ulf","credit_id":"653891ca9c24fc00e33a7be9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1821795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Heinze","original_name":"Christine Heinze","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pharmacist","credit_id":"653891d6c50ad2010ce30c70","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Gebert","original_name":"Chris Gebert","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Louis","credit_id":"653891e541aac400e0409b80","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4338232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deniz Drebing","original_name":"Deniz Drebing","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Noah","credit_id":"653891f7ae366800ea9cae93","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1999255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Aretz","original_name":"Stefan Aretz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6538920341aac400e0409b94","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1999255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stefan Aretz","original_name":"Stefan Aretz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aab402e9251413fe5009801","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3673998","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/70EwnCGeoFIpZ4PBkHazYbmXRqs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4EdWo7Lnr6Xbjx8Icj8LXD13wcc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8ayKVfoeiY3coleOoTyA1XNVMVx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3mGTjBZqOjCVZz7XNOx6ENBLhMG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A4IFuaNElO6RcEU3dFCJEcxCUb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SORRY GUYS - Gay Film - FilmDoo","key":"V0xGG4XVMwE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","published_at":"2018-03-20T10:00:02.000Z","official":false,"id":"5c3742a2c3a3685efe2813d6"}]}}}
