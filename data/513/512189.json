Love and the resulting experience are presented as a metaphor that goes beyond the personal and into a deeper consideration of life’s cycles, ultimately becoming a reflection on life, death and rebirth. Opening with a personal poem and accompanied by fragmented images, the film plunge into Sade’s universe in “120 Days of Sodom” and charts the descent into one’s own, personal hell, revealing the hidden face of society.","popularity":0.1328,"poster_path":"/qi8CD0sVyGeGNZLW4EmXxXhcHH9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frig","video":false,"vote_average":3.1,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1466499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Biño
