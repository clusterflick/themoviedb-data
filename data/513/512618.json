Like other city symphony films, Thatcher’s follows the chronology of a day’s activity, fragments continuous action, and emphasizes quotidian objects (the alarm clock, the toaster, the coffee pot) to present a modernist visual record of Toronto. The film was named one of the Ten Best amateur films of 1934 by Movie Makers magazine.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pO0C2FE6rprecTIOzr075Hjd5ZD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1934-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2001216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie P.
