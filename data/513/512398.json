Bodies, objects and natural features are shown from different perspectives and angles, proposing a sort of visual harmony within the silent film. Through geometry, texture, movement and stasis, Patella animates, creating a sense of communion with nature on a similar wavelength to Ana Mendietaâ€™s actions, and with a stark difference to the comparative coldness and objectivity that the work of land artists of the contemporary era would reflect.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/iwMXO8N9ikqJIGM5QiIGuuZRG2h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1967-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terra animata","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2851631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Meldolesi","original_name":"Claudio Meldolesi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fab1f51278d8a003d09b58f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2420117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosa Foschi","original_name":"Rosa Foschi","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fab1f59bf31f2003fe1966e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2000440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Maria Patella","original_name":"Luca Maria Patella","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aad46aa92514116ae01400a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iwMXO8N9ikqJIGM5QiIGuuZRG2h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1967-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
