The sportswomen chosen for this film compete in one-on-one sports, a metaphorical duality which expresses the two sides of the women’s identity – the dark and the light. This film is a visualisation of human duality, of the internal personal struggle, constant in both art and life. The documentary paints a portrait of each woman as a contemporary heroine fighting against adversity while at the same time tenaciously working towards their dreams and personal legends.","popularity":0.0536,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":27193,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fralita Films","origin_country":"LT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2010-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"7 sins","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1599303,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ričardas Matačius","original_name":"Ričardas Matačius","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8fxu8rVeh0hZT5tcazSPeXofEiZ.jpg","credit_id":"6266aba07caa472d78690353","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598490,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Algimantas Apanavičius","original_name":"Algimantas Apanavičius","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/6ALd9FZ56DcUmNH710exAft49GW.jpg","credit_id":"5af44f32925141787c00b0d0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1416760,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rolandas Leonavičius","original_name":"Rolandas Leonavičius","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af446d10e0a26395000a721","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1398227,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Živilė Gallego","original_name":"Živilė Gallego","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/66bc1m63pA5WM3yQHAteZCUnWZc.jpg","credit_id":"5af446e80e0a26396400a17e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2039983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristina Inčiūraitė","original_name":"Kristina Inčiūraitė","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/fu3Y8uLjZMdy6dYcuUnoAufe5lP.jpg","credit_id":"5af44840925141790f008974","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1330399,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Titas Petrikis","original_name":"Titas Petrikis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/kUQrXp2UlWSgsWFntTps0DnTD6v.jpg","credit_id":"5af44856c3a3682151005f97","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2039983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristina Inčiūraitė","original_name":"Kristina Inčiūraitė","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/fu3Y8uLjZMdy6dYcuUnoAufe5lP.jpg","credit_id":"5af44698c3a368214800e89a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1238920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darius Vaiciulis","original_name":"Darius Vaiciulis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af44f010e0a26397100adff","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2034704,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Arvydas Norkeliūnas","original_name":"Arvydas Norkeliūnas","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5af447a8925141791c00aae6","department":"Lighting","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2039983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristina Inčiūraitė","original_name":"Kristina Inčiūraitė","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/fu3Y8uLjZMdy6dYcuUnoAufe5lP.jpg","credit_id":"5af448c492514178f7008cf8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1696172","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lt","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
