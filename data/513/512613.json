He is well known for his majestic buildings in Europe and Asia that rise with nature inspired geometry and complex shapes that could belong in a fantasy. Nobody knew how to build this project until a team of Mexican constructors accepted the challenge after two years of nobody stepping up to it. But there was a catch. They only had 27 weeks to build something comparable to the Guggenheim in NYC. This is the story of that team who tested the Mexican genius to solve a complex puzzle told by the men and women who made it. On time. On a budget. Against all odds.","popularity":0.2394,"poster_path":"/7OLxZB0z6zHePwvZ7tZ5CHW0qVx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumática Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2016-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mexican genious deserves a museum.","title":"No Further Instructions","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2557336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toyo Ito","original_name":"Toyo Ito","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"60a2df9f6332f7003fe6642f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3092644,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juan Morales","original_name":"Juan Morales","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a2e039590086002924383e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2404578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francisco Gonzalez Piña","original_name":"Francisco Gonzalez Piña","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a2dfdbb0ba7e0029400979","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537695,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Oswaldo Flores","original_name":"Oswaldo Flores","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a2dff6d4cc8e0058114666","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537695,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Oswaldo Flores","original_name":"Oswaldo Flores","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a2e01cb0ba7e0079423ebb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2537695,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Oswaldo Flores","original_name":"Oswaldo Flores","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a2e00e8072980029ab1dbe","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2404578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francisco Gonzalez Piña","original_name":"Francisco Gonzalez Piña","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a2dfd065686e004191c383","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9099288","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1547,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5HcMxQ78dnBB5AFSu172EE2F8f3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2749}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2700,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7OLxZB0z6zHePwvZ7tZ5CHW0qVx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1800},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/jNdxcFmtGHixV2miP1criw5m8kQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/vujFYuzEFy1HK2C6ZPXY6Bfaq0s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2551,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i5qSpKtFjDKO2l3AKAgiBnpFDzn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1701}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2598,"name":"museum"},{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"},{"id":33496,"name":"construction"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul International Architecture Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer \"No Further Instructions\" Documentary Film","key":"260488344","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-03-16T20:58:17.000Z","id":"60a2e1a9da9ef200291b2e00"}]}}}
