Originally from the provinces, he arrives in Paris to find work and settle down. He hasn't seen his father in over ten years. His father left the family home, leaving his mother to raise him alone. Leo was able to trace his father via the Internet. He was living alone in Paris. Leo informed his father of his arrival and asked him to take him in while he found an apartment and a job. When Leo arrived at his father's house, he discovered how precarious his life was. He has taken up residence in a small two-room apartment in a working-class district of Paris, and has been unemployed for a long time. As Leo reconnects with his father, he unwittingly discovers his father's hidden life.","popularity":0.0381,"poster_path":"/48KNF2FFBdk8xov1R7W34BHDsUO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pas comme lui","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2000225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theo Galvalisi","original_name":"Theo Galvalisi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5aad1cbc0e0a267833011f1d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1916240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Imberdis","original_name":"Chris Imberdis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/u2CK3Y4BEnHtGosDcrWtwn82oC9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5aad1cc40e0a267830011885","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2000226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nourit Teboul","original_name":"Nourit Teboul","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/xzgyR9zq8u8m7fwjKq4nfarmA6J.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5aad1ccc0e0a267830011895","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1978637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Etienne Audibert","original_name":"Etienne Audibert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"652c2181358da700ad357a63","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1978641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitri Bagot","original_name":"Dimitri Bagot","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/nv64cg1rynkpx4VfV9EUgv4H51n.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"652c218872c13e0120cf2946","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4319565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Fontenaud","original_name":"Nina Fontenaud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"652c2198358da700c6f1b19b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4321852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikael de Sousa Goncalves","original_name":"Mikael de Sousa Goncalves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"652c219cea84c700ca1124c0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2459417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Axel Rodriguez-Allibert","original_name":"Axel Rodriguez-Allibert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"652c21a7f2883802a25eb0c4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4321853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexia Saint-Jones","original_name":"Alexia Saint-Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"652c21ae1f3e60011c4b146d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2124370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexia Sanchis","original_name":"Alexia Sanchis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"652c21b6024ec8010152453b","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franck Llopis","original_name":"Franck Llopis","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/pPUH1FrJ9p3TTSIH9rAAkZAbfLE.jpg","credit_id":"5aad1cb20e0a267824011604","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7585504","wikidata_id":"Q55598934","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ovGkSJDm3XBxWmNC3UcF7rh9Xt7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/48KNF2FFBdk8xov1R7W34BHDsUO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":763}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
