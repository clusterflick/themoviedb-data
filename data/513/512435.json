It is a live animation film shot on location which incorporates both pixilation (stop motion) and time-lapse photography. Every single shot opens up a hidden layer of the house and exposes it to the passing light. Within the accelerated time of the film the house gradually breaks down piece by piece and frame by frame. Once the house is completely dismantled it is reconstructed in a different location.","popularity":0.0465,"poster_path":"/6T54ff2oGVqiyqIVdTlxMVIb5nv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1480462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Inger Lise Hansen","original_name":"Inger Lise Hansen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aad751b0e0a2678330185b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10801456","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6T54ff2oGVqiyqIVdTlxMVIb5nv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
