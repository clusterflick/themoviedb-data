Made using voicemails the Kuchar brothers left on her home answering machine, the artist reveals George and Mike in all their candid honesty leading up to and following Georgeâ€™s untimely death in 2011. McGuire floats their voices along a river of digital scribbles and her own voice in singer/songwriter mode. The beauty of the piece lies partly in how the voicemails, used as-is and chronologically, contain an entire narrative about love and loss in a DIY style reminiscent of the Kuchars.","popularity":0.2196,"poster_path":"/6QRXzAOSPVtUPLXWs4MnP3es5jE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh Hi Anne","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b54e9d89251416dc20059a9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120941,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Kuchar","original_name":"Mike Kuchar","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":"/lw5oEJtwfHwxEV6zfeE05EMqeB7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5b54e9eac3a3685c8b005de2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1650380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne McGuire","original_name":"Anne McGuire","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aab05049251413fe80063f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6QRXzAOSPVtUPLXWs4MnP3es5jE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":725}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1947,"name":"answering machine"},{"id":255665,"name":"death of friend"},{"id":259361,"name":"loss of a friend"},{"id":269798,"name":"voicemail"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
