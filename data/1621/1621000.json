Active as a jazz drummer, composer, poet and visual artist, Johansson has spent decades challenging artistic conventions and genre boundaries.  Born in 1943, he moved to Berlin in the late 1960s and became involved in the city’s experimental scene, including the Zodiak Free Arts Lab. During the 1970s and 1980s he played an important role in the West Berlin free jazz movement around the FMP/SÅJ label, collaborating with musicians such as Alexander von Schlippenbach and Rüdiger Carl.  Influenced by Fluxus and modernist traditions, Johansson developed a distinctive approach based on noise, reduction and the use of everyday materials, anticipating the Echtzeitmusik scene that emerged in Berlin after 1990. The film explores his creative process, artistic philosophy and lasting impact on contemporary experimental music.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8N8KCBjuOaqVcf6Kg0QmTYVVvLZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92442,"logo_path":null,"name":"NI-VU-NI-CONNU","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"2017-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sven-Åke
