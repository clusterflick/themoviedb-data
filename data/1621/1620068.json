The energy-charged New York Marathon follows, suggesting the rush of locations and pace about to unfold. The sense of traveling is persistent, we are taken from the marathon in New York, to breakfast in Maine, back to busy city streets, to the Grand Canyon, sky, the dancer Dana Reitz working out in the woods, poets posing, and the journey goes on. There is hardly a breather. Lines of David Shapiro's poem 'When a Man loves a Woman' are printed occasionally across the screen In one segment we hear Alice Notley read her poem 'A Woman comes into the Room.' Essentially a collage of images and sound, the precise order of events is unimportant. Overlays of time, season and location become fulfilling and cumulative experience, the particular sequences like cuts on a diamond.\" – Joe Giordano","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/oX2xAcrUynAsU9j4fN8Jf0l5Ik.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mobile Homes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2244509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Notley","original_name":"Alice Notley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"696fb07552a6709be7fe1270","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154537,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudy Burckhardt","original_name":"Rudy Burckhardt","popularity":0.1287,"profile_path":"/i8sIbuaK3f667J0I0PhYpssdzb8.jpg","credit_id":"696fafbf52a6709be7fe126a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oX2xAcrUynAsU9j4fN8Jf0l5Ik.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
