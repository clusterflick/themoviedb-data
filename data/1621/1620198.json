It was the only remake to consult John Cleese, the writer and title role of the original series. Apart from the pilot, no other episode was ever aired and it's reported that John Cleese made a cameo in one of the unaired episodes.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4jLiwCD6ziSKDSt1LW28NG2Icu2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42272,"logo_path":"/2bAuO4EvS59O1uXZQAKXG0HIXQg.png","name":"RTL","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2001-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zum letzten Kliff","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jochen Busse","original_name":"Jochen Busse","popularity":0.4216,"profile_path":"/1oCy5wBFDQLTCYvZeSEDmORHxif.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Viktor Stein","credit_id":"696fecde2aade342f8fe13ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1682840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitri Alexandrov","original_name":"Dmitri Alexandrov","popularity":0.2122,"profile_path":"/hJ6tfGoq9YKq1F8XgcamKgfWLbi.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Igor","credit_id":"696fed03a505329e13e0ad09","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1286833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Jarczyk","original_name":"Robert Jarczyk","popularity":0.1959,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Meyerhoff","credit_id":"696fed20927588fd8f962361","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":50221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Rieschel","original_name":"Claudia Rieschel","popularity":0.5122,"profile_path":"/ptt7uNE00Y6wq0AcQ8QdgphTCT2.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Helga Stein","credit_id":"696fed33ddfa392ea0caf14c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1245168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Trischan","original_name":"Michael Trischan","popularity":0.3789,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Werning","credit_id":"696fed46455206d16e7abfc2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1963576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saskia von Winterfeld","original_name":"Saskia von Winterfeld","popularity":0.0243,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Polly","credit_id":"696fed602aea77c3e17abfaf","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cleese","original_name":"John Cleese","popularity":1.8026,"profile_path":"/dhDw43v7EY52GG3Z4H8B9mr2s9p.jpg","credit_id":"696febe10a06a35c9f442b46","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1317205,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Titus Selge","original_name":"Titus Selge","popularity":0.1579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696fec0fb397353bbdcaf282","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4600607,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Ehrhardt","original_name":"Christian Ehrhardt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696fec1f3253051bd6f2ba47","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1624955,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Gebhart","original_name":"Michael Gebhart","popularity":0.1117,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696fec2da31390fe09f2bb18","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458441,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Thorsten Knatz","original_name":"Thorsten Knatz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696fec6b54ff853823caf1c3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5952323,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rolf W.
