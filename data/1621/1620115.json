Far from a traditional documentary, the film serves as a personal exploration of the filmmaker’s own relationship with the city, navigated through a lens of irony and farce. Baldazzi engages in a playful, dialectical game with the concept of stardom; her stated objective is to \"destroy the myth\" of the diva, yet she achieves a striking paradox. By maintaining the total absence of Greta Garbo for the entire duration of the film, the legend is not erased, but rather powerfully re-established through its own void.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greta Garbo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5951860,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anna Baldazzi","original_name":"Anna Baldazzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696fc367a8d1d4e097fe1372","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5951860,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anna Baldazzi","original_name":"Anna Baldazzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696fc37c1f37420d4dabd24c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1128170,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alberto Marrama","original_name":"Alberto Marrama","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696fc3a354ff853823caf0b8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1673411,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pier Farri","original_name":"Pier Farri","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696fc3b5adc32fc4d1f2b9f1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
