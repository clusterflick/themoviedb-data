Produced at the height of the oil boom, this 34-minute documentary examines Venezuelan lifestyles in the 1970s and early 1980s, questioning the consumerist fantasies fueled by petro-wealth. Through interviews with merchants, bankers, U.S. academics, and the testimonies of Venezuelans themselves, the film maps the era’s version of the “American Dream” as lived—and projected—abroad. Winner of national and international awards and directed by Carlos Oteyza, Mayami nuestro offers a sharp, historically grounded critique and an open invitation for new generations to reflect on the legacy of oil and its cultural consequences.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/4olB2ysWG4A9rUBIDDFCCXvXp7n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":240441,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinesa","origin_country":""},{"id":15134,"logo_path":"/rMIs9GyhTaZ5dZEKlw2pgXuPb1G.png","name":"Bolívar Films","origin_country":"VE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mayami nuestro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5953132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Romero","original_name":"Luis Romero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6970b1cb8dd9b794dfa90c0b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5953133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacinto Cabrera","original_name":"Jacinto Cabrera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6970b1d737697e991f03893f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4970477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enrique Benshimol","original_name":"Enrique Benshimol","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6970b1e70035da4f97038905","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Oteyza","original_name":"Carlos Oteyza","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":"/yxZHyPafWOOxICmaBT7Ayz3jG9f.jpg","credit_id":"6970b0cc540889740b26f0cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Oteyza","original_name":"Carlos Oteyza","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":"/yxZHyPafWOOxICmaBT7Ayz3jG9f.jpg","credit_id":"6970b0d526abf5d5a4a90b47","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185624,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hector Gonzalez","original_name":"Hector Gonzalez","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6970b1033bf3d88a0375745d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185626,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Steven Ferrari","original_name":"Steven Ferrari","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6970b117cd38deb598ceb667","department":"Crew","job":"Second Unit"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1537092,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Josué Saavedra","original_name":"Josué Saavedra","popularity":0.08,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6970b12a46564bb6aaa90b3d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1662857,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Freddy Véliz","original_name":"Freddy Véliz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6970b13a68b90dd9fd26f0d5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185634,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chuchito Sanoja","original_name":"Chuchito Sanoja","popularity":0.1754,"profile_path":"/1nm7yTX4WeCkRJSJeg80HtT3Ri7.jpg","credit_id":"6970b14e8f9a1bb45c55279d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1662859,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jorge Jacko","original_name":"Jorge Jacko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6970b2078ba15eb85b038814","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4olB2ysWG4A9rUBIDDFCCXvXp7n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":214745,"name":"venezuelan history"},{"id":251170,"name":"oil boom"},{"id":360507,"name":"miami"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
