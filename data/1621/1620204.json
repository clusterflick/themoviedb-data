The main character of Dear Mr/Mrs is in search of his/her true identity. This quest served as a metaphor for \"today’s fashion\" (2011), in which the boundaries between masculine and feminine had begun to fade. It’s a spooky story surrounded by delicate movements and passionate tension, showcasing 2 fashion pieces per graduating student.  Many years later this short film has garnered some attention, due to the involvement of musician and composer Sophie Xeon, with the short featuring an early version of 'Elle' and the infamous 'Get Stupid'.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xZN2ti9vQxxyyYH3nMVvstH5BeL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9048,"logo_path":"/8PwAiqOvu57EUlPeZDeTsW7IRuB.png","name":"Hazazah
