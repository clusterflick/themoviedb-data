The film is adapted from the book by S.E. Hinton (also the author of \"The Outsiders\" upon which that film was based) and follows the story of a kid named Rusty James (Matt Dillon). All his life he looked up to his older brother (Mickey Rourke), known only as \"The Motorcycle Boy,\" and strove to be like him in every way.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Location in Tulsa: The Making of 'Rumble Fish'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0495875","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
