Recently divorced, Sam worries about the direction of her life until she receives glowing fan mail from William Corwyn, a stratospherically successful author known for his female-centric novels. When Sam and William meet, their mutual literary admiration sparks an intense chemistry, and both believe they have found The One. But as in their own novels, things between Sam and William are not what they seem. William has multiple stalkers, including a persistent one known as The Rabbit. He lives on a remote Maine island, where his writing life mirrors The Shining. When writers connected to William’s Darlings support group start turning up dead, Sam must ask: Is it The Rabbit—William’s primary stalker? Another woman scorned? Or does it lie somewhere in William’s identity?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murder Your Darlings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39382937","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
