Set in a run-down Wellington villa in 2003, CATERPILLAR follows three women living separate lives under one leaky roof. Sixteen-year-old Cassie is all bravado and vulnerability, drifting into risky territory as she searches for belonging. Her mother Maxine, 52, is a formidable single parent and filmmaker on the brink of a long-awaited breakthrough, finally offered a greenlight—if she can land a star. Holding everything together is Huia, Cassie’s grandmother, 80, whose life has been defined by quiet service to family and a private obsession with raising monarch caterpillars, dreaming of one day witnessing the legendary butterfly migration in Mexico.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When memory begins to fade, love is put to the test.","title":"Catepillar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":152523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marta Dusseldorp","original_name":"Marta Dusseldorp","popularity":0.7656,"profile_path":"/rDjED0RKwd9UTnEobjl2CjNrV5S.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Maxine","credit_id":"69717f3c874c8a09e76e6c65","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":66612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Harrow","original_name":"Lisa Harrow","popularity":0.9853,"profile_path":"/xkSAsTcQIQXJCSPalIaVTHDEMTS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Huia","credit_id":"69717f5684f86733f4daa22a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2418659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anais Shand","original_name":"Anais Shand","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/3onfoksDZWt9GDzJbvVRuDmAGww.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Cassie","credit_id":"69717f736b6a002ef50938b6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1211193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chelsie Preston Crayford","original_name":"Chelsie Preston Crayford","popularity":1.1729,"profile_path":"/kJBvjYTn9wDhFT51z8dHPDDHnHc.jpg","credit_id":"69717f924b14f15f54eba85e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1211193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chelsie Preston Crayford","original_name":"Chelsie Preston Crayford","popularity":1.1729,"profile_path":"/kJBvjYTn9wDhFT51z8dHPDDHnHc.jpg","credit_id":"69717fa641597353a291a5fb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1356763,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Georgina Allison Conder","original_name":"Georgina Allison Conder","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69717fcc4fcff548d7daa23c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3133115,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Marshall","original_name":"Andrew Marshall","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69718048e5d5b83026820284","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":568264,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maria Ines Manchego","original_name":"Maria Ines Manchego","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6971806484f86733f4daa244","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128841,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jonathan Woodford-Robinson","original_name":"Jonathan Woodford-Robinson","popularity":0.1234,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69718085715f37f935eba84f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1360000,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Crayford","original_name":"Jonathan Crayford","popularity":0.0817,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697180b11f3d8e3d3291a62d","department":"Crew","job":"Score Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5954783,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Heather Hayward","original_name":"Heather Hayward","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6971813435982b7e648202df","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5954786,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Briar Vivian","original_name":"Briar Vivian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6971815bfbbc85916a6e6cb0","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1609177,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Michele Perry","original_name":"Michele Perry","popularity":0.1388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69718226b794efb98deba86b","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup & Hair"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2296003,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Anna Houghton","original_name":"Anna Houghton","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69718243fed7b7f560daa261","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34356684","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
