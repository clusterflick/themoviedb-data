The film follows a communal choreography; a cinematic moveable feast where a diverse group of people add colour, nuance and shape to their community identity through the vivid, visceral nature of memory and its connection to dramatic experience. Shot on 16mm film in the Dublin suburb where the director grew up and inspired by the ritual of Beating The Bounds, Parish is a film work that utilizes documentary, fiction, biography, myth, and memoir.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/12ogO8UGxPbr8MFD9FsCPxKtAaf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3440873,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eóin Heaney","original_name":"Eóin Heaney","popularity":0.0462,"profile_path":"/4HC5cyOfSOehJ2S3ZbygL0Vthpz.jpg","credit_id":"6971600298b5f91182996f2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/12ogO8UGxPbr8MFD9FsCPxKtAaf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
