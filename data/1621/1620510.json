He is not only an outstanding guitarist, but also a virtuoso on the oud, the Arabic lute. His decades of engagement with Arabic music have made Bunka a mediator between the Orient and the Occident. In \"City of Sounds,\" he embarks on a journey through the diverse musical scene of the Egyptian capital. He meets promising young talents who are currently only known to insiders, as well as established music greats such as Grammy Award winner Fathy Salama and Egyptian megastar Mohamed Mounir, whom Bunka has accompanied several times on his tours.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"City of Sounds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5600138,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Janek Romero","original_name":"Janek Romero","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6970cf1af22836c641fd101b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Max-Ophüls-Preis","release_date":"2015-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
