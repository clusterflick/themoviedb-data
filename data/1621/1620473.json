This elder from the Amazonian forest articulates two powerful and prophetic warnings: first, a demand for respect toward the sovereignty of Indigenous beliefs and culture; second, a grave denunciation of the threat posed by “criollo” presence and its economically irrational logic to the natural balance of the Amazon. Through Yavarí’s voice, the film contrasts modern exploitation with a millennia-old Indigenous worldview grounded in harmony with nature, turning the documentary into an early and resonant plea for cultural dignity and ecological consciousness.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/5RGZxEUjUAa6f6300BW2u7XGF1Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":240425,"logo_path":null,"name":"Concejo Municipal de Caracas","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yo hablo a Caracas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5953194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barné Yavarí","original_name":"Barné Yavarí","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6970b7dacda3e69814ceb62c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1471244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julio Mota","original_name":"Julio Mota","popularity":0.1179,"profile_path":"/trz0Qb2Kdj1fCmk9BXZZY0eLKyb.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6970b8e1c0c7bc0bba8b0373","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":987000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Azpúrua","original_name":"Carlos Azpúrua","popularity":0.0663,"profile_path":"/dBwMYxG7GysMx0n2P91hRThXPcT.jpg","credit_id":"6970b7f50426589e19270483","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":987000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Azpúrua","original_name":"Carlos Azpúrua","popularity":0.0663,"profile_path":"/dBwMYxG7GysMx0n2P91hRThXPcT.jpg","credit_id":"6970b801dd2f325c66ceb567","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1781579,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alfredo Chamanare","original_name":"Alfredo Chamanare","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6970b88d1ad4cc0ff5ceb5d6","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1820824,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Freddy Siso","original_name":"Freddy Siso","popularity":0.1292,"profile_path":"/wVhRPqqIyKAQPlW4aZdx77ru3df.jpg","credit_id":"6970b89e0465357fc65526e2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1471254,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Héctor Moreno","original_name":"Héctor Moreno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/pcTHaLfXzkvH1QbclFuEQB2xQkq.jpg","credit_id":"6970b8b729520c7f23038934","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5953204,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bernardo Sequera","original_name":"Bernardo Sequera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6970b8ccc0c7bc0bba8b0370","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2352849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael New","original_name":"Michael New","popularity":0.0916,"profile_path":"/6u0Po8TxMsA4OSLMJG711vg77OA.jpg","credit_id":"6970b8fb7eeda78b8f757485","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5RGZxEUjUAa6f6300BW2u7XGF1Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5968,"name":"amazon rainforest"},{"id":347374,"name":"yekuana"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
