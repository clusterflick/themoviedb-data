Far from being merely a film about music, it delves into the social roots and collective identity of the barrio, using rhythm and everyday life as a lens to reveal the bonds, struggles, and shared histories of its inhabitants. Through its intimate portrayal of people, sounds, and spaces, the film becomes a vivid testament to popular culture as a living expression of community and belonging.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/wYpDKG7xy90bVhuOypFmCSZQQIc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":240425,"logo_path":null,"name":"Concejo Municipal de Caracas","origin_country":""},{"id":238309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Departamento de Cine de la Universidad de los Andes","origin_country":"VE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El afinque de Marín","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5213227,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Grupo Madera","original_name":"Grupo Madera","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6970b501cd38deb598ceb67c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacobo Penzo","original_name":"Jacobo Penzo","popularity":0.2082,"profile_path":"/aTgvAbH3TmfzpyavZL31KrOOTrA.jpg","credit_id":"6970b54f98e29568c3552738","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacobo Penzo","original_name":"Jacobo Penzo","popularity":0.2082,"profile_path":"/aTgvAbH3TmfzpyavZL31KrOOTrA.jpg","credit_id":"6970b55b6ec55bffae813c6f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":987000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Azpúrua","original_name":"Carlos Azpúrua","popularity":0.0663,"profile_path":"/dBwMYxG7GysMx0n2P91hRThXPcT.jpg","credit_id":"6970b5a0bb120e4aa526f095","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5953169,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hernán Vera","original_name":"Hernán Vera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6970b5b9ef6b30edd4813db5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1302025,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"José Alcalde","original_name":"José Alcalde","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6970b5e9f6484e0176a90acc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1471254,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Héctor Moreno","original_name":"Héctor Moreno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/pcTHaLfXzkvH1QbclFuEQB2xQkq.jpg","credit_id":"6970b60029520c7f2303891b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1468393,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stefano Gramitto","original_name":"Stefano Gramitto","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/pnFJilM5S0WP6r5aV7bubxoNrzJ.jpg","credit_id":"6970b61537697e991f038968","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4966326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Livio Quiroz","original_name":"Livio Quiroz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6970b638d856e2aacfa90b1e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Solveig Hoogesteijn","original_name":"Solveig Hoogesteijn","popularity":0.1811,"profile_path":"/5rSMLl4UeCDib2zZ264li5OE5Oz.jpg","credit_id":"6970b65a1ad4cc0ff5ceb5b9","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wYpDKG7xy90bVhuOypFmCSZQQIc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181214,"name":"salsa"},{"id":361028,"name":"tambor"},{"id":366180,"name":"afro-venezuelans"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
