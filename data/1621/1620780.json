Maybe it is a reminder of our future. We always look back on our life, asking what if I did not make that decision? What would happen? The protagonist in the play, Elder Hana, finds that she has the opportunity to return to her own consciousness in the past. She wants to change her decision. That made her realise that the personality shaped by herself is also lovely. The decision made in the past is not a concern anymore.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enter Your Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3047465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hana Tam","original_name":"Hana Tam","popularity":0.0833,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Hana","credit_id":"69715c9698ee66f67b546786","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
