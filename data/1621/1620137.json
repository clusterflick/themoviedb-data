Originally presented within the \"Woman’s Gaze\" section of the Kinomata showcase, Faloja’s lens acts as an analytical tool, peeling back the layers of everyday symbols to reveal the ideologies embedded in domestic life. It is an intellectual and cinematic reflection on language, education, and the subtle ways in which our material world shapes human behavior.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giocattoli","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1704885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paola Faloja","original_name":"Paola Faloja","popularity":0.0812,"profile_path":"/JxvEkGx10UHTLdIDWrM3RBvTa0.jpg","credit_id":"696fd177c5de2ee934442c25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240902,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mario Masini","original_name":"Mario Masini","popularity":0.206,"profile_path":"/ipSoYgsoTW579YC36DiB8wWkmVV.jpg","credit_id":"696fd24532e6f1771cabd333","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
