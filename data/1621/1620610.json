Encounters with a mysterious stranger guide her through subtle shifts in perception, revealing fragments of time, obsession, and the intangible weight of absence. As the journey unfolds across barren towns, shifting dunes, and the endless horizon, the boundaries between inner experience and outward reality blur, culminating in a quiet, cyclical meditation on loss, longing, and the ephemeral traces we carry within us.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"What is lost may never have existed.","title":"The Marge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5953832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Kappen","original_name":"Dominique Kappen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Character #1","credit_id":"69710773c3efdec683de506d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5953833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva de Boer","original_name":"Eva de Boer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Character #2","credit_id":"69710782696be4744414d025","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5953418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cathaleeya van Keulen","original_name":"Cathaleeya van Keulen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/8rM7Dl9iB0WyOnxEpus7oa1IaQm.jpg","credit_id":"6971043bc55300ee7314d054","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5953418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cathaleeya van Keulen","original_name":"Cathaleeya van Keulen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/8rM7Dl9iB0WyOnxEpus7oa1IaQm.jpg","credit_id":"697104439b3ccc3cf314d062","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5953418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cathaleeya van Keulen","original_name":"Cathaleeya van Keulen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/8rM7Dl9iB0WyOnxEpus7oa1IaQm.jpg","credit_id":"6971044dbc58759edc08da40","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5953418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cathaleeya van Keulen","original_name":"Cathaleeya van Keulen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/8rM7Dl9iB0WyOnxEpus7oa1IaQm.jpg","credit_id":"6971045fbff1f8538454659e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5953818,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Milan Hovenier","original_name":"Milan Hovenier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697106379558f5dfc15465ec","department":"Crew","job":"Creative Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5953828,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thibo Meurkens","original_name":"Thibo Meurkens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697106d17efb4177585465aa","department":"Writing","job":"Other"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
