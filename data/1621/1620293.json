This reboot finds the Bard’s young lovers, royalty and mischief-making fairies caught in the wilds of the web. During the summer 2020 when a global pandemic has altered the way humans interact, social distancing has forced our young lovers to maintain their connection via high-tech devices. Trouble-making fairies begin hacking, catfishing and trolling the quartet while fairy royalty Titania and Oberon wage war on one another, causing global anarchy. Amidst all this chaos, an intrepid community theatre troupe tries to mount their humble Zoom play amidst less than stellar conditions. This contemporary spin on \"Midsummer\" – with all original songs - reminds us how the digital world can simultaneously pull us apart and bring us together. \"Midsummer\" won Best Feature Length Comedy at the 2022 Legacy Film Festival.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xDVEI8YI5r0xIrHI9t6kghXTSkM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
