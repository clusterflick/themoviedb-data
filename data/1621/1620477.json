She's mortified... but a natural. Convinced by her best friend, she secretly forms a band called The NunDead. Her newfound confidence leads to a date with the altar boy but also a fight that gets her suspended. Thinking she bailed on their first gig, her bandmates bust her out of the house just in time to win a Battle of the Bands. But when she faces expulsion and her mother's wrath at a disciplinary hearing, footage of her kick-ass performance has an unexpected effect on her mom.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Edie Arnold is a Loser","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5953241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adi Madden Cabrera","original_name":"Adi Madden Cabrera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Edie Arnold","credit_id":"6970bb9b6b2146bb3d552734","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4345220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cherish Rodriguez","original_name":"Cherish Rodriguez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Luanne Arnold","credit_id":"6970bbac8ba15eb85b038858","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5953242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"McKenna Tuckett","original_name":"McKenna Tuckett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Frances","credit_id":"6970bbb92516993f6d813d78","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5953243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niki Rahimi","original_name":"Niki Rahimi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Judith","credit_id":"6970bbc6f1511cc7d57574b3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5953244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexa Paige","original_name":"Alexa Paige","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Ellen","credit_id":"6970bbea565d10d0a6a90bf5","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5953239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Megan Rico","original_name":"Megan Rico","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6970bb5fe34cb5f11b26f14e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3901851,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kade Atwood","original_name":"Kade Atwood","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6970bb8858379bbefffd0f72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36173361","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2026-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
