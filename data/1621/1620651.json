After being uprooted from Farasa of Cappadocia as refugees, the family of young Arsenios settles in Konitsa, Epirus where he grows up with his mother and grandmother, who inherit to him their deep faith in Christ as well as their love for all people. Fast forward to many years later, his time in Mounth Athos and his move to Filotheos monastery play a catalytic role in his religious journey. Eventually, he sends a photograph of himself to his mother, bidding her farewell and telling her that from then on the Virgin Mary will be his mother. He no longer signs using the name Arsenios, but Paisios.","popularity":0.1429,"poster_path":"/6VJsJNr05yFgc8YISMiMN2l9U84.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138013,"logo_path":"/yEjnTczKifm6nzAs1RvX0Z55Mnq.png","name":"Green Olive
