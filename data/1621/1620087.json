Rather than a rigid factual account, the film immerses the audience in an atmosphere of pure euphoria and shared joy. Music serves as the essential thread that weaves the entire work together, while the visual narrative mirrors the fluidity of dance—constantly assembling and dissolving to the beat of the performers' movements. It is a rhythmic and sensory experience that prioritizes feeling and atmosphere, capturing the spirit of a culture through the harmony of sound and motion.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gitani","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Gypsies","type":"English translation"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5951713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Satenig Gugiughian","original_name":"Satenig Gugiughian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"696fb6729ccb7d810bf2b816","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":394,"name":"gypsy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
