We witness Gilbert Horn going into a brothel for the first time to buy a child for his own sexual fantasies. Alongside the story of the addict, is that of the three innocent girls who live in the brothel being subject to the daily hell of their slavery. These interweaving vignettes show both the humanity and depravity of human trafficking and sex addiction, while offering an opportunity of restoration for the addict and freedom for the slave.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/bJGEWhR0qSvidGeflWa2N0cxQ5B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"10
