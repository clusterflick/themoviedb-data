Operating across borders, cultures and political divides, this rare collaboration sees law enforcement agencies from countries including Russia and the United States working side by side. Filmed over several years, this powerful investigation offers unprecedented access to one of the most challenging areas of modern policing. As officers track offenders in digital spaces designed to evade detection, the film reveals not only the scale of the crimes  involved, but the resilience, determination and moral clarity of those committed to bringing perpetrators to justice. The Darkest Web is a sobering yet hopeful portrait of courage confronting cruelty and offers an unparalleled insight into one of the toughest but most important jobs in global policing today.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":50510,"logo_path":"/fNWALeT5F0pOcTtBAeV1No8fB9f.png","name":"BBC Storyville","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/xEjkqz7Ow5tTMUx715YDdvEBAgi.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Darkest Web","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5954751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Squire","original_name":"Greg Squire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"697175bc4b14f15f54eba82a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5954752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Piranty","original_name":"Sam Piranty","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697175d54311f9655beba88f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1441963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mandy Chang","original_name":"Mandy Chang","popularity":0.1197,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697175f035982b7e6482028c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2978804,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucie Kon","original_name":"Lucie Kon","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69717603c8849708dad1d1be","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5732834,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Liz Gibbons","original_name":"Liz Gibbons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6971765ad4b31af0eddaa1eb","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
