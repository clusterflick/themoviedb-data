When she attends a summer camp organized by radical climate activists, she finally becomes part of a group where she is needed and can make a real difference. Together, they will build a world the way they want it to be. But it turns out that the organizers are eco-fascists — racists who believe that in order to save the planet, we must put ourselves first. Chris begins to doubt, but a lust for power grows within her. How far is she willing to go to keep everything she has gained?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/73Rv8meTAz7phSNCL8bj0M6ADn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148461,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carbs Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nipster","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5952535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saga Stenman","original_name":"Saga Stenman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Chris","credit_id":"6970156b46021558f126eeee","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2227881,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sunniva Eir Tangvik Kveum","original_name":"Sunniva Eir Tangvik Kveum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697015994fab7ef2df813a93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5952537,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sarah Olsson","original_name":"Sarah Olsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697015a8ee5dd4aeb6ceb38b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2180642,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jan Bastian Muñoz Marthinsen","original_name":"Jan Bastian Muñoz Marthinsen","popularity":0.0753,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697015d2430e5532bb8b01a9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2176301,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Lunneborg","original_name":"Adam Lunneborg","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697015e5219de1822a813a9c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33444507","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qVRjw2KmBhJ86rji8r3bhKaKGMW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/73Rv8meTAz7phSNCL8bj0M6ADn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cfT7mPrEhStujhBiGarT9GbGfWi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
