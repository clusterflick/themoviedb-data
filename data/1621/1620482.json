Interesting points are made about Godard's use of colors, his references to antiquity, and to Le Mépris as a work of self-reflexive cinema. Godard scholar Alain Bergala explains how Godard had intended to posit Le Mépris at a turning point in film history, \"perhaps the last 'great' film\", with its emphasis on characters as \"instances\" (the young couple, the American producer, the great German director).","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Mépris - Totalement Tendrement Tragiquement","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Gaurichon","original_name":"Julien Gaurichon","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6970bff4e0e7330c4455273e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
