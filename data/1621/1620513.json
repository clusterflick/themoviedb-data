It was supposed to land in Viikki, but strong winds prevented the attempt. The event was a news sensation that mobilized photographers, filmmakers and tens of thousands of viewers. Jäger and Ekebom shot an intense short film, the first part of which follows the gathering of a huge crowd at the landing site. When the landing itself was not successful, the film captured impressive scenes of the airship's massive figure moving in the sky. The slow rhythm and constructivist composition of the final scenes emphasize the external impact of the airship, when, according to the closing text, it \"then disappears among the autumn-gray clouds covering the western horizon.\" The world's long-distance air traffic was to be handled by rigid-hulled airships, \"zeppelins\". The destruction of the airship Hindenburg on 6.5. 1937 at Lakehurst Field in the USA ruined their future.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":58494,"logo_path":null,"name":"Komedia-Filmi","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1930-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ilmalaiva Graf Zeppelinin käynti Helsingissä 24.IX 1930","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1703062","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
