The film is realized not only as a dance document but also as a Cine-Dance, a term made by Iimura, that is meant to be a choreography of film. The filmmaker \"performed\" with a camera on the stage in front of the audience. With the main performers: Tatsumi Hijikata and Kazuo Ohno, the film has the highlights such as Butohs of a soldier by Hijikata & a mad woman by Ohno. There is a story of the mad woman, first outcast and ignored, at the end joins to the community through her dance. Inserted descriptions of Anma (The Masseurs) are made for the film by the filmmaker, but were not in the original Butoh. The film, the only document taken of the performance, must be seen for the understanding of Hijikata Butoh and the foundation of Butoh.","popularity":0.3535,"poster_path":"/3E6xrTPfHYsYQdIT0WStQMSKZMI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1963-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Masseurs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Anma","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatsumi Hijikata","original_name":"土方巽","popularity":0.1091,"profile_path":"/uvDK1WvB0991qGKbvzjlF2vKN4T.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"586a88cc925141212f000557","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuo Ohno","original_name":"大野一雄","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/3xZ760OO9kGDXSwznMPDLJN7muz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"586a88f2925141213100055c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takahiko Iimura","original_name":"飯村隆彦","popularity":0.1918,"profile_path":"/yOQilAdmhPQbSz6hUBDQr1E9dMO.jpg","credit_id":"586a890e925141212d0005d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1305145,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takahiko Iimura","original_name":"飯村隆彦","popularity":0.1918,"profile_path":"/yOQilAdmhPQbSz6hUBDQr1E9dMO.jpg","credit_id":"5e0b7846be6d8800130181be","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21613586","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1499,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3E6xrTPfHYsYQdIT0WStQMSKZMI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":7640,"name":"butoh"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
