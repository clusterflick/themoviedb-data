The music is sub­lime. Not even a pin would dare drop. Sud­denly, a cell­phone rings and the mad­ness starts. The pianist loses his hand, the vio­lin­ist, while tun­ing, falls asleep, and later wakes up in the mid­dle of a motor­way, trans­formed into a “River­dancer”. When the pianist returns, the piano is locked, telling him to insert his credit card. Mean­while, the vio­lin­ist loses his bow to a vac­uum cleaner and his part­ner just talks on the phone while read­ing a paper, eat­ing, and, play­ing the piano upside down all at the same time. These and many other “night­mares” unfold before audi­ences’ eyes and ears.  “A Lit­tle Night­mare Music” is a unique show, full of vir­tu­os­ity, enchant­ing music and zany, out­ra­geous humour. Ideal for audi­ences aged 8 to 88, this show is sure to cap­ti­vate you and crack you up whether you’re a clas­si­cal music enthu­si­ast or the type who runs for cover, at the mere men­tion of Mozart.","popularity":0.3524,"poster_path":"/xmTtcnmeYsAVRKPkBlppzLjIepq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85030,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neonfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2010-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Little Nightmare Music","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1341071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksey Igudesman","original_name":"Aleksey Igudesman","popularity":0.0699,"profile_path":"/y9ONDr4J95LZy3NCimgAS9qi8r1.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"58699fbac3a3680f540121b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1731165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Hyung-Ki Joo","original_name":"Richard Hyung-Ki Joo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/92XoX52hkWRmtI98vcUfBLwENRw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"58699fd39251414e87011a3e","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.687,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xmTtcnmeYsAVRKPkBlppzLjIepq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1031}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3536,"name":"cello"},{"id":207592,"name":"piano"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
