She has important news to share with her best friend, Frances, but how best to make such a grand announcement? This slice-of-life peek into the life of God's little princess reinforces the vital message that each child is royally important to God.  In The Pink Ballerina, Gigi and Frances take their first dance lesson.  With reluctant practice and awkward help from Tiara (her new dog) and Lord Fluffy (her not-so-cooperative cat), Gigi struggles to dance perfectly to make God proud of her.  But she unexpectedly learns that God is most proud when we show love to others.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"God's Little Princess","title":"Gigi, God's Little Princess: Gigi's Hugest Announcement","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1379255","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
