The stories, mainly from the popular 'Bhagvat' and 'Vishnu Purana', also show Krishna vanquishing Keshi (Haribhau), Kamsa's general who arrives in disguise to capture him. Finally, when Kamsa unleashes rain and flood over the city (in a departure from the original legend where Indra caused the natural disaster), Krishna raises the mountain Govardhan over the people to protect them.","popularity":0.0976,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":114427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prabhat Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1938-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Marathi","iso_639_1":"mr","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gopal Krishna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1302366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ram Marathe","original_name":"Ram Marathe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Krishna","credit_id":"5866fa2ec3a3681104002310","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shanta Apte","original_name":"Shanta Apte","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5866fa38c3a368110400231f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parsuram","original_name":"Parsuram","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pendya","credit_id":"5866fa4ac3a36810ea0025bc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ganpatrao Tambat","original_name":"Ganpatrao Tambat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"King Kamsa","credit_id":"5866fa79c3a36810f80024e9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haribhau","original_name":"Haribhau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Keshi","credit_id":"5866fa8ac3a36810f80024fc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manajirao","original_name":"Manajirao","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5866fa94c3a36810e8002633","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1114584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophia","original_name":"Sophia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5866fa9f9251413e41002481","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365885,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sheikh Fattelal","original_name":"Sheikh Fattelal","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5866f9919251413e3f00220f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1135632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vishnupant Govind Damle","original_name":"Vishnupant Govind Damle","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5866f983c3a36810ea0024e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660702,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Master Krishnarao","original_name":"Master Krishnarao","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60416a03af6e94005930959b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1678039,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shivram Vashikar","original_name":"Shivram Vashikar","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604169dfd1ca2a005973d1ca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1632313,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"V.
