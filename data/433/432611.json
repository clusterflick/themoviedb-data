In a notebook he finds in his flat, he crosses out a list of things he should do or pay attention to if he wants to become part of the French elite. In a painful dialogue with Martin, his alleged son, Hector notices himself in Martin; a young man full of dreams and ideals that turn out not to be matched by reality.  Metropole is a film about migration, about assimilation, about the haunting of one’s past. It is a film about identity; lost, assumed, false. Metropole tells the story of millions of people out there who leave their homes behind in order to find a new one.","popularity":0.3969,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metropole","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Descas","original_name":"Alex Descas","popularity":0.2798,"profile_path":"/1FUMJTbVflnDR8vZL3J1Hv8f7tV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"589f1f5bc3a3684bb400e69d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1186112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoli Fuller","original_name":"Yoli Fuller","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/iYAaposeFivaPaGW1rREoNoqxSW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"589f1f629251415762005284","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730993,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ozal Emier","original_name":"Ozal Emier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586961b89251414e8200f201","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730994,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Virginie Le Borgne","original_name":"Virginie Le Borgne","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589f1ff1c3a3684bc400e83f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1284,"name":"identity"},{"id":1526,"name":"home"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":219896,"name":"assimilation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
