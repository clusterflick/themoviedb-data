She created a cathedral-like space out of twelve thousand white silk dresses in which visitors, as in a ritual, roamed around and fell silent. And where people confessed intimate details about children who were or were not born, about sexuality and life-choices. This resulted in a majestic epic about motherhood, miscarriages and menopause. In a visual and poetic way, the film penetrates into what is probably still one of the greatest of taboos, menstruation, and, as a consequence, touches upon universal themes around life and death.","popularity":0.0923,"poster_path":"/gsgxqZziQ3DSbfELtGbHksQthkY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2011-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water Children","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1731349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomoko Mukaiyama","original_name":"Tomoko Mukaiyama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"586a5a039251414e7f018fc1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1295140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aliona van der Horst","original_name":"Aliona van der Horst","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/xheLYA7rGNbmiwXF6T9PBviZI3S.jpg","credit_id":"6076f1fc4d0e8d007b0630ab","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28727,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank van den Engel","original_name":"Frank van den Engel","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6076f1d52faf4d0058deea52","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1666017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maasja Ooms","original_name":"Maasja Ooms","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6076f1f27776f0006dca03cf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1731349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomoko Mukaiyama","original_name":"Tomoko Mukaiyama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6076f1e18ddc340040ae8be7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383312,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jorinde Sorée","original_name":"Jorinde Sorée","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6076f1cb8ddc340079900379","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1666017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maasja Ooms","original_name":"Maasja Ooms","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6076f1ea7776f0002983a7d4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1295140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aliona van der Horst","original_name":"Aliona van der Horst","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/xheLYA7rGNbmiwXF6T9PBviZI3S.jpg","credit_id":"586a5a47c3a3680f58019a93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1295140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aliona van der Horst","original_name":"Aliona van der Horst","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/xheLYA7rGNbmiwXF6T9PBviZI3S.jpg","credit_id":"586a5a5c9251414e870186c2","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3196668","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gsgxqZziQ3DSbfELtGbHksQthkY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"WATER CHILDREN | Women Make Movies | Trailer","key":"YpIIXEYEgnw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-04-17T19:51:18.000Z","id":"6076f22919ab59006ed7fd6a"}]}}}
