Different ports of call are framed by the solitary sojourn of a dockworker, perhaps remembering his own past, or dreaming of another's. Like the hunters in his dream, the film seeks to recover ancient and seldom viewed images from the recesses of our collective memory.","popularity":0.0856,"poster_path":"/978XTPbvrLzBWSCrK3Spufm09fo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45908,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hypnotic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dockworker's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"O Sonho do Estivador","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Morrison","original_name":"Bill Morrison","popularity":0.1188,"profile_path":"/9pwxNAvq6fh2q6aFrp17BdRxtvk.jpg","credit_id":"5866a99fc3a3684f59000026","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730148,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kurt Wagner","original_name":"Kurt Wagner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5866a9dc92514109da000074","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730149,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ryan Norris","original_name":"Ryan Norris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5866a9e492514109df000077","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730147,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Curtas Metragens","original_name":"Curtas Metragens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5866a9bdc3a3684f5300005a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038003,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Morrison","original_name":"Bill Morrison","popularity":0.1188,"profile_path":"/9pwxNAvq6fh2q6aFrp17BdRxtvk.jpg","credit_id":"5866a9a7c3a3684f56000037","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5918984","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1195,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/978XTPbvrLzBWSCrK3Spufm09fo.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":796}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
