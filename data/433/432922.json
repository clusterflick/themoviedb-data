Remarkably determined and self-sufficient, Frank makes his home in the wild bush.","popularity":0.1491,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cree","iso_639_1":"cr","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man Who Chooses the Bush","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25361,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tony Westman","original_name":"Tony Westman","popularity":0.1826,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d0cb25d19a3300426df4de","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3892232,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pete Ladouceur","original_name":"Pete Ladouceur","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f8695a07f50082f3a5a3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1992628,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Patton","original_name":"Richard Patton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f83f5a07f5007b0b59a0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3892230,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frank Ladouceur","original_name":"Frank Ladouceur","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f85ae72fe800b20534c9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3892231,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Modeste Ladouceur","original_name":"Modeste Ladouceur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d2f861e72fe80084916062","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3892229,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Barry P.
