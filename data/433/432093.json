The urgency of having to go to Transylvania as fast as possible to bring back the remains of his own father turns out to be an adventure of a different kind for Martin. What he thought would be a short trip becomes an extended odyssey through the former east block country. Instead of Count Dracula, Martin meets a Romanian couple, Imre and Agi. Involuntarily bound to each other, they start the search. Through Transylvania, through prejudices, mundane worries and emotions, Martin's German bookkeeper sensibilities come face to face with the simplicity of Hungarian-Rumanian life.","popularity":0.2002,"poster_path":"/ojMQ5rp2tA966mchFcMRioECAv1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drum bun - Jó utat!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1515633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felix Theissen","original_name":"Felix Theissen","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/x0uyzmAywgBssGbHErhul4p2jtb.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Martin Schlegel","credit_id":"586429b2c3a36852d20102cc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tibor Pálffy","original_name":"Tibor Pálffy","popularity":0.103,"profile_path":"/hvQxJY9lISyOVTRHwCzZWEP7LOf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Imi","credit_id":"586429d4c3a36852d20102e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1729261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bíró Kriszta","original_name":"Bíró Kriszta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3fN2AmUqWxZv9HRQsCdiGveHAAq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Agi","credit_id":"65c10a625cd16e01499cd2d3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544547,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Ralston","original_name":"Robert Ralston","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":"/bLWxFKd8UBTmPVV1PUoNEYyK2Tc.jpg","credit_id":"58642b029251412b84011ecc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0398030","wikidata_id":"Q106718071","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ojMQ5rp2tA966mchFcMRioECAv1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":167043,"name":"road movie"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hu","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
