It looks at imaginations of homes across four examples of buildings made over the period of a century. These are Lukhshmi Vilas Palace in Baroda – the gigantic home built by a progressive monarch in the late 19th Century; Villa Shodhan in Ahmedabad – a private residence which represents the idea of domesticity within Nehruvian modernity, designed by Le Corbusier; Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad, which epitomises the Gandhian aspirations of the nation-state; and public housing in post-independence Delhi, designed by the Government of India to house refugees from Pakistan and the bureaucrats of the newly independent nation.","popularity":0.0461,"poster_path":"/fjeHDnf3YYVRcDIIeI029sabEYm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nostalgia for the Future","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1729520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Avijit Mukul Kishore","original_name":"Avijit Mukul Kishore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586544499251412b90020503","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1729521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rohan Shivkumar","original_name":"Rohan Shivkumar","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586544589251412b7d01e62b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5dAC7Qfpr6cP8ng8OqnFDNdRnq7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fjeHDnf3YYVRcDIIeI029sabEYm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ab","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
