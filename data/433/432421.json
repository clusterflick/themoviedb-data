Jack, his mother, and his sister are then forced to enter Witness Security Program. Jack becomes \"Zach\" and moves to Elko, Nevada, a town in the middle of nowhere. There he meets Sam, the strangest school custodian he has ever encountered, and Catalin, a girl who might make Zach's uprooting worth the trouble. But just as Zach finally begins to piece together a new life, he finds himself in danger again-and this time his actions could determine the fates of everyone he cares about.","popularity":0.6544,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":84977,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goodinstinct","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Zach's Lie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1653291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaten Matarazzo","original_name":"Gaten Matarazzo","popularity":0.8485,"profile_path":"/sUHpObjk9EkRVfpAY0auTZj3xx5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Darrell Gill","credit_id":"586754069251413e41006650","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1567479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diego Velazquez","original_name":"Diego Velazquez","popularity":1.6888,"profile_path":"/sYfMqj0BO6y5fNB80AAbKOfbMTR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Zach Granger / Jack Osborne","credit_id":"586754069251413e41006652","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1730333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Logan Thompson","original_name":"Logan Thompson","popularity":0.1834,"profile_path":"/83H2f8eRUhqfwSjaBxA9x2jRaVK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Peter","credit_id":"586754079251413e3f0063a9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":999325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Landry Bender","original_name":"Landry Bender","popularity":0.5848,"profile_path":"/oyB2v2GuSkgZZk0cGzpf5Ix43kL.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Catalin Cristobal","credit_id":"5a033bae92514111e401cfe4","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730332,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Erahm Christopher","original_name":"Erahm Christopher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586753ea9251413e45006614","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730331,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Roland Smith","original_name":"Roland Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586753dd9251413e3a006591","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730332,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Erahm Christopher","original_name":"Erahm Christopher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586753f59251413e41006640","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6167880","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
