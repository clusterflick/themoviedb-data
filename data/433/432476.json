Baritone Michael Volle stars as Hans Sachs, the cobbler-poet at the heart of this story of love, art, and youth vs. age. Leading Wagnerian tenor Johan Botha is Walther von Stolzing, the young knight whose new ideas upset the traditional ways of the mastersingers, and Annette Dasch sings Eva, the girl he loves, whose hand has been promised to the winner of a singing contest. Johannes Martin Kränzle as the pedantic town clerk Beckmesser, Hans-Peter König as Pogner, Eva’s father, and Paul Appleby as David, Sachs’s apprentice complete the stellar cast.","popularity":0.2155,"poster_path":"/kn9h9qaWTYTmLGtM1ckNgCvH9GY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":309,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: The Master-Singers of Nuremberg","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Great Performances at the Met: Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg","type":"TV title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Met: Live in HD - Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1304569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Volle","original_name":"Michael Volle","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/mjmUSpJDdnD9qwEUKdpRkVFay8O.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Hans Sachs","credit_id":"5867e0c6c3a3680f480002c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1566680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johan Botha","original_name":"Johan Botha","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Walther von Stolzing","credit_id":"5867e0edc3a3680f5c000294","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1154136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annette Dasch","original_name":"Annette Dasch","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Eva","credit_id":"5867e10bc3a3680f5c0002b1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248678,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Levine","original_name":"James Levine","popularity":0.1985,"profile_path":"/p6ujBSZMKTc2zNCytIvvg9NKL1D.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff94d95bbcae00040af5549","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MET Orchestra","original_name":"MET Orchestra","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff94d9cfcec2e003e1407af","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Schenk","original_name":"Otto Schenk","popularity":0.2738,"profile_path":"/9Xw1Sdl6oIKLHsHT4jyJ1lMeF4g.jpg","credit_id":"64e244a1e19de9013a2908c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71473,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Wagner","original_name":"Richard Wagner","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":"/fHPBxuWgTjRT8dnGBNi8s3lipDI.jpg","credit_id":"64e2445c1d1bf4011eb24279","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248678,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Levine","original_name":"James Levine","popularity":0.1985,"profile_path":"/p6ujBSZMKTc2zNCytIvvg9NKL1D.jpg","credit_id":"64e244b18c0a48013aaff484","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71473,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Wagner","original_name":"Richard Wagner","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":"/fHPBxuWgTjRT8dnGBNi8s3lipDI.jpg","credit_id":"64e2444b8c0a480100cf41cb","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4301100","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kn9h9qaWTYTmLGtM1ckNgCvH9GY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"et","file_path":"/zRrkFBPPpqNmUfJU2SN0jiW69a4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e5rLzFkjugeiKVqOaOzHlXiNPse.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":933}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS - Great Performances at the Met","release_date":"2015-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
