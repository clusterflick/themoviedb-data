And a U.S. Senator, investigating veteran's projects, adds new complications.","popularity":0.5329,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Campus Honeymoon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":976019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyn Wilde","original_name":"Lyn Wilde","popularity":0.2194,"profile_path":"/A3pbi4PAfOShyrbVWb6NFc94hLP.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Skipper Hughes","credit_id":"58690d47c3a3680f4500d0c7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":990654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Wilde","original_name":"Lee Wilde","popularity":0.3149,"profile_path":"/A3pbi4PAfOShyrbVWb6NFc94hLP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Patricia Hughes","credit_id":"58690d57c3a3680f4e00b6eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adele Mara","original_name":"Adele Mara","popularity":0.5853,"profile_path":"/l2qifL9nsEpwKmuy6HxVAYYWnBc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bessie Ormsbee","credit_id":"58690d6e9251414e7a00c159","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Crane","original_name":"Richard Crane","popularity":0.1679,"profile_path":"/kMVfRppKr0KyjO4MPhDcivWZXlg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Robert Watson","credit_id":"58690d80c3a3680f5100cb1c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1647731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Hackett","original_name":"Hal Hackett","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/jLMjHGDYVnoCqgcHBqDp8mo68Ts.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Richard Adams","credit_id":"58690d909251414e8200c39c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilson Wood","original_name":"Wilson Wood","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Busby Ormsbee","credit_id":"58690da29251414e7a00c175","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Bachelor","original_name":"Stephanie Bachelor","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/twYZV4S1M53cpnutNVOgLnMMbOr.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dean Carson","credit_id":"58690db4c3a3680f4500d106","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teddy Infuhr","original_name":"Teddy Infuhr","popularity":0.255,"profile_path":"/8hxdWVjGdLxftA4GgApYnkWeILo.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Junior Ormsbee","credit_id":"58690dc5c3a3680f4800c313","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin Maxwell","original_name":"Edwin Maxwell","popularity":0.1826,"profile_path":"/k31nSbkIkSqWelDQyWvn5zF1g9q.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sen.
