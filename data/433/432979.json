Directed by Seán Ó Cualáin, the film explores Byrne's undeniable talent and rebellious personality, which set him apart on the track but also clashed with the conservative and elite world of Formula 1. Byrne’s story is filled with highs and lows, from his dominance in lower racing categories to his brief, rocky stint in Formula 1 and subsequent struggles. The documentary combines interviews, archival footage, and personal insights to portray the complexities of Byrne’s character and his “what could have been” legacy in motorsport.","popularity":0.8577,"poster_path":"/8HOH6bSzMJnzwHHXvmexI3J54ha.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85672,"logo_path":null,"name":"dot
