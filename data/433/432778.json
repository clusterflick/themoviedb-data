To their shock, they find out that the washing machine has strange powers: their heads are swapped by sticking them in the washing machine. When it turns out their heads can't be swapped back, they must go back home with each other's heads. Because their households have very different habits and traditions, they end up in awkard situations. Through these situations, they learn a lot of new things about each other.","popularity":0.5042,"poster_path":"/lhMlVnjmFLlOlzQinqbrZOIMnSq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44438,"logo_path":"/mnoDqJffaYKJmOQ6plRZYksZPXF.png","name":"Viking
