The installation takes threads from his recent films, Cemetery of Splendor and Fever Room, both of which feature the same actors. Here, he takes them deeper into an imaginary world and ponders the future of shared consciousness. The videos depict a landscape where the protagonists are confined to a room, along with the viewers. With no way out, they infiltrate each other’s dreams.\r Invisibility mirrors the troubled state of Thailand’s politics. It proposes a decayed vision of the future where one needs to constantly evade reality. The viewing experience shifts between seeing and not seeing, fact and fiction, space and void.","popularity":0.0347,"poster_path":"/m3niT3Fsngxq3F6rvjqt251CsYZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invisibility","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Apichatpong Weerasethakul","original_name":"Apichatpong Weerasethakul","popularity":0.6245,"profile_path":"/zZyGqhaPNzeb88bHkYiCQHHXyhY.jpg","credit_id":"5868db989251414e7a00a5b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Apichatpong Weerasethakul","original_name":"Apichatpong Weerasethakul","popularity":0.6245,"profile_path":"/zZyGqhaPNzeb88bHkYiCQHHXyhY.jpg","credit_id":"5868dba1c3a3680f5400a966","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m3niT3Fsngxq3F6rvjqt251CsYZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
