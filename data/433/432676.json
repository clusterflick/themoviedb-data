A teenager has locked himself in - shutting out a helpless father, mother and sister. In Japan, youths like him have already been given a name: Hikikomori (the secluded). The phenomenon is also beginning to spread throughout the Western world. This is all the family has been able to find out. All they can do is stand in front of the locked door and ask, beg, implore, throw tantrums, despair, accuse, ignore and hope. All the while, the door increasingly becomes a mirror of their own lives.","popularity":0.4741,"poster_path":"/evgvK5GH0o7sMTfPVncvdzdUCwk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92062,"logo_path":"/c6y9r3AGLneeHWydhQiE83K7TQG.png","name":"Made In Germany
