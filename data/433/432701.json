Not much happens plotwise: Acuff, playing \"himself,\" is a tenderfoot who somehow manages to come out on top when he heads westward. The villains (who aren't all that villainous) try to promote a phony stock deal, but Roy and his pals foils their plans. The comedy honors go to Guinn \"Big Boy\" Williams as a blowhard sheriff. Smoky Mountain Melody was scripted by Barry Shipman, the son of pioneering female filmmaker Nell Shipman.","popularity":0.9241,"poster_path":"/rFfSAm799MS6XiB0HAsJJgasXHm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"SWING YOUR SWEETIE to the...SMOKY MOUNTAIN MELODY","title":"Smoky Mountain Melody","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1235040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Acuff","original_name":"Roy Acuff","popularity":0.1034,"profile_path":"/mLSQUcW9q9ETzH72ggRVClvmRDv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Roy Acuff","credit_id":"5869ce36c3a3680f54013cdf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guinn \"Big Boy\" Williams","original_name":"Guinn \"Big Boy\" Williams","popularity":0.2441,"profile_path":"/oOJIg1Cnsc9IsT1861kLxyQjkuy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Saddle Grease Williams","credit_id":"5869ce45c3a3680f5c0129bd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Arms","original_name":"Russell Arms","popularity":0.1188,"profile_path":"/wKiLVOnw3VAYlO54T3MmjlNc97a.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bruce 'Kid' Corby","credit_id":"5869ce539251414e7f01385e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":140275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sybil Merritt","original_name":"Sybil Merritt","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mary Files","credit_id":"5869ce60c3a3680f45014f2c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tommy Ivo","original_name":"Tommy Ivo","popularity":0.3088,"profile_path":"/p6TjaHEf7xPpambjR2qauzEEwY2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tommy Durkin","credit_id":"5869ce6d9251414e78013811","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Robards Sr.","original_name":"Jason Robards Sr.","popularity":0.3321,"profile_path":"/bTAO5oYzTCYc62FJ27Ivei0KAAl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Josh Corby","credit_id":"5869ce7d9251414e87013418","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Cheshire","original_name":"Harry Cheshire","popularity":0.1386,"profile_path":"/eYW4TZXfi6Z0sEkfs3iSYfMQAej.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Doc Moffitt","credit_id":"5869ce8b9251414e7501340e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred F.
