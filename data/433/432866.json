One of them dies and comes back to life as a negro. The racists have to tolerate him until they figure out how to lift his curse. Conflict is the essence of comedy, but in this movie racial conflict is the basis for laughter. This is not the tame sort of corny humor that is seen on TV. This is stuff that is going to knock you on your ass. Are you tired of censored comedy? Then look no further. This is as far as we can push the boundaries while still being funny.","popularity":0.0512,"poster_path":"/k7ORMkEXD4Dt5a69cFWZqvJ52Db.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Seeing is Disbelieving","title":"Spooked","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929084,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Glen Baisley","original_name":"Glen Baisley","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Office Worker","credit_id":"5eae28f7cdbaff0021b0ed73","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1302223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Bowkey","original_name":"Ed Bowkey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5eae29031a934f0026e98525","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1289658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyndsey Brown","original_name":"Lyndsey Brown","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5eae290f1a934f0026e9852f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Zebub","original_name":"Bill Zebub","popularity":0.2551,"profile_path":"/bhZNgeH9PbnxFCsKeOZEzBVewQ1.jpg","credit_id":"5eae28dbedeb43001fc69c63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Zebub","original_name":"Bill Zebub","popularity":0.2551,"profile_path":"/bhZNgeH9PbnxFCsKeOZEzBVewQ1.jpg","credit_id":"5eae28e40b7316001c3ef0b4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2438122","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k7ORMkEXD4Dt5a69cFWZqvJ52Db.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
