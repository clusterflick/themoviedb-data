Emily Andersen is a renowned interiors, architecture, landscape, and portrait photographer; Somewhere Else Entirely captures intimate moments with Ruth at home in London: making notes; out walking; and by the sea in her old home- town of Brighton. Each image is framed precisely, a testament to Emily’s expertise as a photographer; reflecting Ruth’s writing, precision is given to each aspect of composition and detail. Throughout Somewhere Else Entirely Ruth’s voice recounts aspects of her life and writing practice. A moment of poignance lies in a moving reading by Ruth of her poem, the titular Somewhere Else Entirely, which was written following the death of her husband, the writer Alan Sillitoe.Somewhere Else Entirely moves gently, a pace that blurs boundaries between moving image, photography, and portraiture.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/7fH0xrrsz1JUhnHJOg5iqUHCUd5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Somewhere Else Entirely","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Fainlight","original_name":"Ruth Fainlight","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"69136311591b1bb437a0d2ed","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5810688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Andersen","original_name":"Emily Andersen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913633414dc73b323d26261","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5810688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Andersen","original_name":"Emily Andersen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69136372dc4f028746a0d29b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5810688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Andersen","original_name":"Emily Andersen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691363931913c5a927dd267e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7fH0xrrsz1JUhnHJOg5iqUHCUd5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":569}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
