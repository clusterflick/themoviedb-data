After the marriage she discovers that her new husband is more interested in talking about being a success than in actually trying to be one, and she is eventually forced to get a job. One day her husband overhears his wife's former suitor's plans for a particular piece of property; in order to purchase the property and impress his wife with his business acumen, he borrows money from a pretty and wealthy woman. When his wife finds out, she resents her husband's relationship with the woman and demands a divorce.
