As the meat—strangely alive and deeply self-aware—forces Joe to confront questions of existence, shame, and meaning, she spirals through a city that continues without noticing.  Haunted but unwilling to accept what’s happening, Jo carries the talking flesh to a friend’s ramen shop, where, under the weight of his own denial, he gives it up.  The meat is chopped and served without protest. A deadpan exploration of guilt, disconnection, and the absurd comfort of pretending nothing’s wrong.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MEAT THING","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
