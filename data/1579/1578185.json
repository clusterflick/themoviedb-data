As a result of the Civil War in Greece, over 28,000 children between age of 2 and 14, with tears in their eyes, were separated from their parents and siblings and transferred to various East European countries, to be saved from the consequences of the war. Growing up in group homes and camps across Eastern Europe, far away from their families, they carried with them the burden of the memories to all those events. With the assistance of Red Cross they searched for their lost ones over the years. The film portrays the testimonials from some of these 28,000 children refugees who were evacuated from their homes in northern Greece between 1948 and 1949 during the Greek Civil War.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/8CwN1FFT5KNz08cqRXMx3wHIvp6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":252006,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Children of 1948 Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Children of 1948","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","title":"Generacija 1948","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzana Dinevski","original_name":"Suzana Dinevski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6911e1a4c00d8cc228ce8d19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzana Dinevski","original_name":"Suzana Dinevski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6911e1b0443c9c2d828754c1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15263102","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8CwN1FFT5KNz08cqRXMx3wHIvp6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
