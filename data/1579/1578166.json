Each film follows a different long-forgotten path, one of many ancient roads and crossroads that once formed a network connecting human settlements and still function today as invisible signposts through the landscape. This work was created between Indemini and Sant'Abbondio. The footage is partly self-referential, showing me and my working process in moments of interaction between body, camera, and terrain, guided by light, weather, and chance. The sound is a composition of collected sounds recorded during the walks, including the voices of a church choir in Indemini. The 16 mm material was hand-processed on site in a hybrid development process using plants, fungi, and water collected at the locations visited. The films become carriers of the landscape itself, living archives of earth, movement, and memory.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/IDEWc1gb7B3GdwDR84TyVa9rIc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"the ground is bleeding light (indemini – sant’abbondio)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2755031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yannick Mosimann","original_name":"Yannick Mosimann","popularity":0.0744,"profile_path":"/zdvNJoIBHFAVqM76iq8AruG4ZP5.jpg","credit_id":"6911d8198c84b2cc9c3a31bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"yannick.mosimann","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/IDEWc1gb7B3GdwDR84TyVa9rIc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":298901,"name":"analog photography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
