Who cares for whom, and under what conditions? How can we think of care beyond normative role models, structural isolation, and exploitation? In light of the climate crisis, wars, growing social inequality, and the profound experiences during the pandemic, one thing is clear: without radically rethinking care work, a more just future cannot be achieved. The group screening brings together three video works that deal with practices of care. Starting from the private sphere, the works develop perspectives on care beyond the neoliberal burden of personal responsibility and examine how solidarity can be conceived and lived.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Rethinking care as a collective act.","title":"Hope Road","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
