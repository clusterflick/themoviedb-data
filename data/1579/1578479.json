In this documentary, Fany de la Chica returns to her roots in Jaén to capture the lives of olive growers in a small Andalusian village, both a decade ago and today. As the only female filmmaker from her region, she felt a responsibility to reflect on a way of life that is fading under the growing instability of the countryside. Through an immersive rhythm, the simplicity and beauty of the landscapes, and Dorantes' piano music, the film reveals some of Europe's most pressing challenges: climate change, the agricultural crisis, immigration, and depopulation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/eBNsoqO5u0qrPyyK0YREZMlJAcs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tiempo entre olivos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fany de la Chica","original_name":"Fany de la Chica","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6912593b2d43dd68d6d25e23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fany de la Chica","original_name":"Fany de la Chica","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69125943f1aaf2deb2ce8cd9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fany de la Chica","original_name":"Fany de la Chica","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6912594f9e0edb599f87561e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fany de la Chica","original_name":"Fany de la Chica","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6912595a9e0edb599f875621","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fany de la Chica","original_name":"Fany de la Chica","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6912596647d1fab49c31b7b9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2442551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Phillips","original_name":"Andrew Phillips","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6912598227297f2e379ac90c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2567430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federico Torrado Tobón","original_name":"Federico Torrado Tobón","popularity":0.0339,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69125999119eef2e209ac99a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2724509,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Blanca","original_name":"Antonio Blanca","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691259b29e0edb599f875624","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4508297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Carrera","original_name":"Marco Carrera","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691259bc1bfc2ab5fdce8e19","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5809122,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alba Torremocha","original_name":"Alba Torremocha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691259d8b82cc8c707dd289c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3330127,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Peña Dorantes","original_name":"David Peña Dorantes","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691259f995143dfa46a0cdb8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1200,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eBNsoqO5u0qrPyyK0YREZMlJAcs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
