But when Danish invaders attack again, his world collapses as his home burns and his loved ones are killed. Captured and sold into slavery, Einar holds onto his mother’s final words to survive. He is bought by Ketil, a landowner who offers him freedom in exchange for hard work. On Ketil’s farm, Einar meets Thorfinn—a broken, remorseful warrior haunted by his violent past. Together, they toil in the fields, driven by the hope of redemption and a future without chains. As their bond deepens, both men struggle against the cruelty and injustice of their world, searching for meaning and peace amid endless suffering.
