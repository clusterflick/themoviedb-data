He encounters Fang Jiang, a single mother, yet both carry their own unresolved family burdens. Fang Jiang is pursued by the married Wen Sheng, while Shi Ming's wife, Yuan Yuan, though sensing something amiss, feels sympathy for Fang Jiang. The desires, guilt, and realities of married men and women tear at every sensitive heart. This film piles up melodramatic tropes to a breaking point, its devastating impact is astonishing.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"恨妳恨妳又愛妳","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
