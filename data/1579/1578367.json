These were scanned into the Atari and manipulated through the programme in various ways. The music is generated by the same programme and is intended to evoke an atmosphere of a jazz/punk night club. In the original computer version I played part of the sound live from a keyboard into the computer (though the MIDI port). This input slightly modified, interactively, the development of the programme. The tape version was edited from one of the ‘performances’.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4xQ57w7MFf5V8o0dBASyISiDITj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1986-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heads I Win Tails You Lose","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1278000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Malcolm Le Grice","original_name":"Malcolm Le Grice","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":"/dXry25TyoLUpViu8Paqf6RMkDv7.jpg","credit_id":"69122be23a7b019fa89ac8b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4xQ57w7MFf5V8o0dBASyISiDITj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
