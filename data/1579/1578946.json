While sailing to his home in New York, Quaigg treats Tiare roughly and throws Captain Croft overboard when he comes to her defense. Quaigg attempts to tame Tiare by exploiting her superstitions and threatening her with the same whip he uses on his pet leopard. Later, Tiare awaits her husband's return from a hunting trip with a gun and fires as a man enters, only to discover that it is Captain Croft, who was saved from drowning. Quaigg finds them together and releases the leopard. However, the beast kills its master before being shot by Croft. Afterward, Tiare and Croft return to the South Seas together.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5Qv1WH959ZKR1Ev7uwTB7h739OG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Players-Lasky Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1923-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Leopardess","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"豹の叫び","type":"Japanese title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Brady","original_name":"Alice Brady","popularity":0.6206,"profile_path":"/v9XVx9jV7ntUKog525jrYkSnq3n.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tiare","credit_id":"691364f7c1daa774efc06844","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2356809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Langford","original_name":"Edward Langford","popularity":0.0944,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Captain Croft","credit_id":"69136517c91fc053addd2a5c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Montagu Love","original_name":"Montagu Love","popularity":0.2584,"profile_path":"/aCOahFpYdCKMOg8RO9jMsFOA5xx.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Scott Quaigg","credit_id":"6913652a595b54d1ff31be6e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Kent","original_name":"Charles Kent","popularity":0.1243,"profile_path":"/aizKDALV8TFVBL3e1vV1UkcVHE7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Angus McKenzie","credit_id":"6913bb0bf4e946c1c43a38ce","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Beranger","original_name":"George Beranger","popularity":0.2335,"profile_path":"/ila7m49FIrwRvaEn8LK6riEY4ox.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Pepe","credit_id":"6913bb5e95aa21afb7a0d3fc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3428402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite Forrest","original_name":"Marguerite Forrest","popularity":0.126,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Evoa","credit_id":"6913bbe22075737f024c8d33","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5811384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glorie Eller","original_name":"Glorie Eller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mamoe","credit_id":"6913bc050d1d06c2f031bc2f","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Kolker","original_name":"Henry Kolker","popularity":0.494,"profile_path":"/mZ5QUU0Sm8h5x4YdSO6ekiRGswU.jpg","credit_id":"691364e2a473cfb67d31bdb0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1405332,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Katharine Newlin Burt","original_name":"Katharine Newlin Burt","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6913bc22d60b32fd17c0699a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362935,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"J.
