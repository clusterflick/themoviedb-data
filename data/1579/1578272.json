When she does find out, she seeks a divorce, with the understanding that Bartley will marry Peggy. But Peggy, who toys with many men's hearts, marries Ralph Demarest, thereby cutting off Ralph from his disapproving father's fortune. Peggy accepts money from Horace Demarest to leave Ralph but then flings it in Ralph's face and urges him to make a man of himself. Peggy stands by Ralph, wins Horace's affection, and reunites the Claybournes.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/vjsRZlJZdjXB4SftqSNjeCNqtQU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103523,"logo_path":"/s5Ltmj9KgQKV4tbNnQXIiI4DrW0.png","name":"Pyramid Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Pleasure is the watchword- studio parties in Greenwich Village, expensive restaurant dinners, dancing till the wee small hours, and CLOTHES!","title":"What Fools Men Are","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Modärna äktenskap","type":"Swedish title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Flapper Love","type":"Working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1949239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Faire Binney","original_name":"Faire Binney","popularity":0.0917,"profile_path":"/kmHR2ENi0sjvkFI8JgnrQYnsgr2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Peggy Kendricks","credit_id":"69120392540af423d04c8716","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1459998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Fox","original_name":"Lucy Fox","popularity":0.2053,"profile_path":"/iT6IPns3KiJmmy4ZNm6ppbsrFmq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ola","credit_id":"691203a964a32b21624c8450","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Striker","original_name":"Joseph Striker","popularity":0.1122,"profile_path":"/sueQvtYnpp2Ybg2IZFyQhEPcRQ8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ralph Demarest","credit_id":"691203ba9913d3c4f9876201","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Huntley Gordon","original_name":"Huntley Gordon","popularity":0.0787,"profile_path":"/dlZO1dnpaVuiJyZ3BitziRgolXB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bartley Claybourne","credit_id":"691203cd583f19f6ae9ac4fb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1456112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Billings","original_name":"Florence Billings","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Kate Claybourne","credit_id":"691203e1583f19f6ae9ac4ff","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
