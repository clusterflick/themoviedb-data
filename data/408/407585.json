The opera's arrival at Covent Garden in 2013 was eagerly anticipated, and provided audiences with the opportunity to experience the work of two of Britain's greatest living artists. Benjamin previously collaborated with playwright Martin Crimp on Into the Little Hill, a magical retelling of the Pied Piper fairytale, and for this new work they joined forces with acclaimed stage director Katie Mitchell. For all three, the production marked their main-stage debut at the Royal Opera House.  The tale, inspired by a medieval legend, tells of an ill-fated troubadour, drawn into a liaison with an innocent maiden. But they are observed by the jealous eye of her protector, who wreaks a shocking revenge on the young couple.  Written on Skin draws on a 12th-century Occitan legend about the troubadour Guillaume de Cabestanh.","popularity":0.0799,"poster_path":"/op3ISfeMsloANgvvuijbtCS0PBD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Written On Skin","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":121790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Purves","original_name":"Christopher Purves","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/6PGFBH7jI63b7lFhfzBsLzdpPvp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"57920aa4c3a3683014007260","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1654456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Hannigan","original_name":"Barbara Hannigan","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/cxXsoVoXnt8W81mnibjgN3Ds89r.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"57920ab29251411ff80015d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1466272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bejun Mehta","original_name":"Bejun Mehta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xwgKSgcwok0pPNyiA4bpiIwi8AF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"57920ac09251411f0d00147c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1654457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Simmonds","original_name":"Victoria Simmonds","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/7tU5M50JPl5Jr8NTlXkeuix1h0Y.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"57920acfc3a3685925001413","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Clayton","original_name":"Allan Clayton","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/3PPEaKGboufusJyJoJj6pM1H1uP.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"57920ade9251411fcb0015c6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654455,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Benjamin","original_name":"George Benjamin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"57920b28c3a368577d001784","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orchestra of the Royal Opera House","original_name":"Orchestra of the Royal Opera House","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff9501591f0ea003f95805f","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":155884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katie Mitchell","original_name":"Katie Mitchell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57920a0b9251411f7100141a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654454,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martin Crimp","original_name":"Martin Crimp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57920a55c3a36859610018d9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654455,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Benjamin","original_name":"George Benjamin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586a24ce9251414e7a016b57","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11171574","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1267,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/op3ISfeMsloANgvvuijbtCS0PBD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
