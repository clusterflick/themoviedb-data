Yi Wen's script is full of lively and humorous details, his direction affectionate, while the young stars are charming. The film also paints a picture of a bourgeois lifestyle that was yet to occur in the ex-colony. It has also been aptly compared to the genre of hollywood \"bedroom\" comedy made famous by Rock Hudson and Doris Day in the 1950s.","popularity":0.221,"poster_path":"/lfymjhxfSQV7AX2eMTgk7tCkRM6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1959-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Dream Car","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1158403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Chang","original_name":"Grace Chang","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":"/qR2lesM3uVyfLmJn7efzPCbfbMl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Li Jiaying","credit_id":"587b3a249251413f4600c336","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chang Yang","original_name":"Chang Yang","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":"/4lFvdfacEaqwv9eE1OH5e40WDtY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Zhang Daming","credit_id":"587b3a3c9251413eec00c43e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154735,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evan Yang","original_name":"Evan Yang","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/1emXqbzGX2g05DEVEa6P2w1nc99.jpg","credit_id":"5bf1f11c0e0a26265e073108","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154735,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evan Yang","original_name":"Evan Yang","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/1emXqbzGX2g05DEVEa6P2w1nc99.jpg","credit_id":"5bf1f1349251412f350024c4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0211750","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lfymjhxfSQV7AX2eMTgk7tCkRM6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":645}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
