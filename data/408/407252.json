The film begins in a sacral space, where Randi, a figure that references Ayn Rand, transforms a parapsychological medium into two digital clouds and sends them on a journey through a megalopolis in full growth. There they materialize as two bodies, which go by the names of Mr. Freedom and Ms. Independence.","popularity":0.1271,"poster_path":"/z5Y7RqzhRCgNAor80QOua7R5nCZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79458,"logo_path":null,"name":"Limboland Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freedom & Independence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1332011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bjørn Melhus","original_name":"Bjørn Melhus","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"593df69bc3a3680f33022fc4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1653195,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Max Schneider","original_name":"Max Schneider","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"578e518c925141086400f2e9","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1653195,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Max Schneider","original_name":"Max Schneider","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"578e5198925141183f004dee","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1653196,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eike Zuleeg","original_name":"Eike Zuleeg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"578e51b09251413fa4013d71","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1332011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bjørn Melhus","original_name":"Bjørn Melhus","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593df6a2925141058f028003","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1332011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bjørn Melhus","original_name":"Bjørn Melhus","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"593df6a8c3a3680f33022fd0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16383242","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/z5Y7RqzhRCgNAor80QOua7R5nCZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":592,"name":"capitalism"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kino der Kunst","release_date":"2015-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
