This particular production emerged from the Opernhaus Zürich in 2004. It stars Rodney Gilfry as Pelléas, Isabel Rey as Mélisande and Michael Volle as Golaud. Franz Welser-Möst conducts the Zurich Opera Orchestra; Sven-Eric Bectholf directs for the stage.","popularity":0.2392,"poster_path":"/A4JHsQ9k7CYtGi2ZOsu16iNDNeP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72207,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opernhaus Zürich","origin_country":""},{"id":79627,"logo_path":null,"name":"TDK","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2004-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":161,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pelléas et Mélisande","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Welser-Möst","original_name":"Franz Welser-Möst","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"57948d9bc3a3683f87000e2a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1115341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodney Gilfry","original_name":"Rodney Gilfry","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":"/jPQJ6OkMQYYhKqdZrgcLoTJlq7R.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pelléas","credit_id":"57948da8925141136a00349e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1351648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel Rey","original_name":"Isabel Rey","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/fHy9BzD2LBkenGgKqsRn0I1rspU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mélisande","credit_id":"57948db3925141797e000d0e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1304569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Volle","original_name":"Michael Volle","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/mjmUSpJDdnD9qwEUKdpRkVFay8O.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Golaud","credit_id":"57948dbd92514143020021e1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"László Polgár","original_name":"László Polgár","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":"/pGGeeJVNRAO77YCDxSOfeMultmt.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Arkel","credit_id":"57948dcf925141134f0035bd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1655399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cornelia Kallisch","original_name":"Cornelia Kallisch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/kIgrnxqrYlp5SyRDLk9f3IUfZcE.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Geneviève","credit_id":"57948dd892514142040021b5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1610768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Liebau","original_name":"Eva Liebau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Yniold","credit_id":"57948de292514179a5000e37","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guido Götzen","original_name":"Guido Götzen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"un médecin / un berger","credit_id":"57948dec92514143020021f5","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116773,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felix Breisach","original_name":"Felix Breisach","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":"/cg2Htu3AOmFp61XSKBOcycoXgIr.jpg","credit_id":"57948d55c3a36876c2002117","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193756,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Claude Debussy","original_name":"Claude Debussy","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":"/fHvTJeeUDg4yKih5NBrXKgqajvH.jpg","credit_id":"5c07f540c3a36865bc115348","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201804,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maurice Maeterlinck","original_name":"Maurice Maeterlinck","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c07f570c3a3686370114e5e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4334666","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A4JHsQ9k7CYtGi2ZOsu16iNDNeP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yif8tj60Frzd4BdxdHMbEPBMl5K.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
