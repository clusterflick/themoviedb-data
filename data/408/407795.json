He journeys to Singapore, and tracks down a rogue trader (Kenny Bee), who brought down a large international bank with his illicit activities. Since he has nothing to lose, the reporter volunteers to become the trader's hostage, and uses their journey to find insight into his captor's offbeat criminal methods.
