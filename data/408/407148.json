It is not a film about madness, but about the passing of time in a certain place, which is reflected in simple things, in faces, in objects, nature, places, details, the humanity of the people portrayed. It is a film where every subtle visual and sound element becomes relevant.","popularity":0.0698,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2007-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Time that Rests","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Luis Torres Leiva","original_name":"José Luis Torres Leiva","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/uEP5Q2x66Uqvr9frq5DWe6jnxHI.jpg","credit_id":"578d5af292514108640083c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Luis Torres Leiva","original_name":"José Luis Torres Leiva","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/uEP5Q2x66Uqvr9frq5DWe6jnxHI.jpg","credit_id":"599c5cff925141143b00010c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Luis Torres Leiva","original_name":"José Luis Torres Leiva","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/uEP5Q2x66Uqvr9frq5DWe6jnxHI.jpg","credit_id":"599c5d059251411424000102","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1874661,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Daniela Podcaminsky","original_name":"Daniela Podcaminsky","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"599c5d2cc3a3681b29000102","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Luis Torres Leiva","original_name":"José Luis Torres Leiva","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/uEP5Q2x66Uqvr9frq5DWe6jnxHI.jpg","credit_id":"599c5d1dc3a3681ae2000108","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Luis Torres Leiva","original_name":"José Luis Torres Leiva","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/uEP5Q2x66Uqvr9frq5DWe6jnxHI.jpg","credit_id":"599c5d22c3a3681b290000ec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":577,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fred Frith","original_name":"Fred Frith","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/ldqW8zj9lCakZYsy4Zd1qTJVjkF.jpg","credit_id":"599c5d179251411424000125","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1018944","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
