The DVD picture has great clarity, despite the darkness of Hans Schavernoch’s set design. Other than the cliché of a huge statue head, toppled on its side, the set manages to be suitably representative of a decaying palace as well as an imposing, theatrical space, dominated by the mammoth body of the statue from which the head apparently dropped, draped with the ropes that seem to have enabled the decapitation. Sooner or later most of the characters cling to and twist around those ropes, an apt stage metaphor for the remorseless repercussions from the murder of Agammenon by his unfaithful wife Klytämnestra and her paramour, Aegisthus. Reinhard Heinrich’s costumes capture a distant era while sustaining a creepily modern look — part Goth, part homeless, part Spa-wear.","popularity":0.2097,"poster_path":"/wmVxVPXzH5Ebj97Z3bBa2K8vfHn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vienna State Opera","origin_country":""},{"id":79568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthaus Musik","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":79632,"logo_path":null,"name":"RM Associates","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elektra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1019838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Abbado","original_name":"Claudio Abbado","popularity":0.332,"profile_path":"/v6zf1YHJ3gMAvQ5xmrTYkd4A12.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"57950766925141136a00791a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1045487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Éva Marton","original_name":"Éva Marton","popularity":0.1421,"profile_path":"/5KvVYcoNhvzI9qD1T7U7WmaClsD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Elektra","credit_id":"57950770c3a3683fcf00511a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1116822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Fassbaender","original_name":"Brigitte Fassbaender","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Klytemnästra","credit_id":"5795077a9251412c1f0009d9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1521065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheryl Studer","original_name":"Cheryl Studer","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/c4eYeQanwvL0eI0rB7tMjG3by7b.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Chrysothemis","credit_id":"5795078492514142a4003ae0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James King","original_name":"James King","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/ipxYNujS82tnSr4leJ1jpY0jqV7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Aegisth","credit_id":"57950796925141797e004e70","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Grundheber","original_name":"Franz Grundheber","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Orest","credit_id":"579507a092514142a4003ae8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orchester der Wiener Staatsoper","original_name":"Orchester der Wiener Staatsoper","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self - Orchestra","credit_id":"5ff9218891f0ea003e94c2f9","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Large","original_name":"Brian Large","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/fwMu0qHur53enoBapRcjpKw7Ydq.jpg","credit_id":"579506eb925141136a0078d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553665,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Kupfer","original_name":"Harry Kupfer","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57950727925141426900375f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116875,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hugo von Hofmannsthal","original_name":"Hugo von Hofmannsthal","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/7rWtID3q3d2y2EMysEjNW8dq3JH.jpg","credit_id":"57950749c3a368760500625b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1116795,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Strauss","original_name":"Richard Strauss","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/yMUgur4kSGUAkMV1ujDKZoJNDri.jpg","credit_id":"57dc2d249251414a15000046","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0255136","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wmVxVPXzH5Ebj97Z3bBa2K8vfHn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
