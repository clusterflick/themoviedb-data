Hilarious presents a stand up monologue of a female comedian performing live in front of a studio audience. If humor is a mechanism set to cope in particular ways with disturbing, sometimes forbidden topics, this performance not only offsets these structures through their failure, but also offers a different manifestation of these topics, left exposed without the guise of laughter.","popularity":0.2904,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hilarious","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":657997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hani Furstenberg","original_name":"Hani Furstenberg","popularity":0.1725,"profile_path":"/iAMfKbyQzUyfdUwHjTLTTEIfV4O.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Roee Rosen","credit_id":"578fc9c39251411da7001725","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1504652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roee Rosen","original_name":"Roee Rosen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/iafIF5mGOs4PY970AiU1d9E5vZ.jpg","credit_id":"61f32b5f4fd141009e653ba8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1504652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roee Rosen","original_name":"Roee Rosen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/iafIF5mGOs4PY970AiU1d9E5vZ.jpg","credit_id":"578fc6f8c3a368669e00154d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3747120","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
