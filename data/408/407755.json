With a libretto by Metastasio (edited slightly by Caterino Mazzolà), the work dramatizes the palace intrigues surrounding emperor Titus's attempts to coronate a new bride and the envious Vitellia's attempts to have Titus assassinated (with the help of Titus's friend Sextus) following the deposition of Vitellia's emperor father. Stage director Martin Kušej mounted Tito in August 2003, at the Felsenreitschule in Salzburg; a film of that live performance now appears in this home video release. The cast includes Michael Schade as Titus, Vesselina Kasarova as Sextus and Dorothea Roschmann as Vitellia. The Wiener Staatsopernchor, under the baton of Nikolaus Harnoncourt, provides musical accompaniment; Jens Kilian designed the sets.","popularity":0.1419,"poster_path":"/oe8fySdfoifa1FNvZS50wu5Ucna.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2006-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Clemenza di Tito","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225552,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nikolaus Harnoncourt","original_name":"Nikolaus Harnoncourt","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/tkitTZcuAjS98Ogz59BjYnLcovm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5793df5c9251410d1200eae2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Schade","original_name":"Michael Schade","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Tito Vespasiano","credit_id":"5793df6b92514156800022d4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1352069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vesselina Kasarova","original_name":"Vesselina Kasarova","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/rkyOqckwAYW3rHVGBj92jwxuhCd.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sesto","credit_id":"5793df7692514169c500bd37","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1004025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothea Röschmann","original_name":"Dorothea Röschmann","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":"/xrVdPsmL4rVDnKNgAF4XMaOcMrU.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Vitellia","credit_id":"5793df8092514169c500bd3f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":471356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elina Garanca","original_name":"Elina Garanca","popularity":0.2021,"profile_path":"/2xLi7RtxE1j2FQMuaXvVXkRjIr2.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Annio","credit_id":"5793df8c925141690f00c6fe","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":576103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Bonney","original_name":"Barbara Bonney","popularity":0.1696,"profile_path":"/aO45ClAPTCz0GdQ6b4YFElxMq45.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Servilia","credit_id":"5793df94c3a368403d0024e6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Pisaroni","original_name":"Luca Pisaroni","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":"/56uiFd7X9xJmPPJLFvaulZz6kV5.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Publio","credit_id":"5793df9f92514156b700228b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655135,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pietro Metastasio","original_name":"Pietro Metastasio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5793df42c3a3683fb0002417","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655134,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Caterino Mazzolà","original_name":"Caterino Mazzolà","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5793df36c3a36862cd00b4f2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Large","original_name":"Brian Large","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/fwMu0qHur53enoBapRcjpKw7Ydq.jpg","credit_id":"5793df0cc3a3683ffb0020b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"57dc277b9251412ee1000496","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2278468","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1428,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oe8fySdfoifa1FNvZS50wu5Ucna.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
