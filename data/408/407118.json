The six stories compiled here are indicative of the new version's competent but uneventful nature; scripting, performances, and direction (all hampered by the program's low budget) rarely live up to the plots' potential or the drama and suspense of the original series. Amanda Plummer's Emmy-winning turn as a scientist who travels 50 years into the past to commit a murder in the Season Two episode \"A Stitch in Time\" is the highlight of the disc; the rest (culled from the series' seven-season run) offer well-worn variations on time travel themes. The full-frame disc includes \"The Outer Limits Story,\" which offers talking-head interviews with executive producers Pen Densham and Mark Stern, as well as featurettes on each episode.","popularity":0.6503,"poster_path":"/nka1e3sEaMQ4jCaRQ4dLcPgn2Z3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Outer Limits: The New Series - Time Travel and Infinity","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Diakun","original_name":"Alex Diakun","popularity":0.2389,"profile_path":"/miWLKODjrAYpU2eKfanJcKESi97.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nicholas Prentice","credit_id":"5e8d4298ce997a0017b88889","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Rooker","original_name":"Michael Rooker","popularity":2.6371,"profile_path":"/dq3xFKDWJsQjPffm1bmB3TbMilq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Colonel Beckett","credit_id":"5e8d42c43434307604d4e34f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Plummer","original_name":"Amanda Plummer","popularity":1.1358,"profile_path":"/wEwyajjePFVVn2wFdH1NH7z9Qn5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Theresa Givens","credit_id":"5e8d42efce997a0013b88b9b","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nka1e3sEaMQ4jCaRQ4dLcPgn2Z3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
