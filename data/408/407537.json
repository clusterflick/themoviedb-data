In analogy to the representation function of architecture, Self contemplates the human skin through its potential to design one’s own representation. Yet, once the human body is understood as an architectural envelope, its picture can be expanded arbitrarily and freely modulated. Methodologically, this allows Self to scrutinise the interplay of function and representation in different ways. Self-perception and the others’ awareness of oneself are thereby examined against backdrop of identity, gender and perfection.\" - Claudia Larcher","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589023,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Larcher","original_name":"Claudia Larcher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57919a4bc3a368352d003f6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589024,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Constantin Popp","original_name":"Constantin Popp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57919a5c9251416bad003f6a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
