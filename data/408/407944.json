As Boris, the renowned Yevgeni Neterenko is as justifiably identified with the role in his generation as Chaliapin, London and Kipness were in theirs. Nesterenko gives a remarkably vivid, human portrait of the tormented half-crazed Tsar, and is supported by a first rate ensemble in a richly designed and costumed production that represents opera at its grandest. Particularly outstanding are Vladislav Piavko as the Pretender, Valery Yaroslavtsev as Pimen, Irina Arkhipova as Marina (a role generally associated with Vishnevskaya), Galina Kalinina as Xenia, and Alexsei Maslennikov as the Simpleton.","popularity":0.2701,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":174,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boris Godunov","video":true,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Boris Godunov","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Boris Godunov","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1655679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evgeny Nesterenko","original_name":"Евгений Нестеренко","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/xH6gaMXTJB2B3SHzV74fpFE0Mj2.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Boris Godunov","credit_id":"677558483fc76ea58892c715","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1655761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Arkhipova","original_name":"Ирина Архипова","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/nSpMOK6IvuKNxQXyNOmjqr8cLGB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marina Mnichek","credit_id":"5795165a925141136a007f99","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Galina Kalinina","original_name":"Galina Kalinina","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Xenia","credit_id":"579516649251414239004034","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glafira Korolyova","original_name":"Glafira Korolyova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Fyodor","credit_id":"579516719251412ba3001039","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksei Maslennikov","original_name":"Aleksei Maslennikov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Simpleton","credit_id":"57951679925141797e0054a2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladislav Piavko","original_name":"Vladislav Piavko","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"The pretender","credit_id":"5795168d925141797e0054ac","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valery Yaroslavtsev","original_name":"Valery Yaroslavtsev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Pimen","credit_id":"579516989251412ba3001052","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Grigorieva","original_name":"Nina Grigorieva","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Xenia's mother","credit_id":"5cb4ba69c3a3683c20b26a48","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70650,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Modeste Moussorgsky","original_name":"Modeste Moussorgsky","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":"/80ysKl0MqarVD8G3gEEujncqIii.jpg","credit_id":"579515d792514142a4004134","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590449,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexander Pushkin","original_name":"Александр Пушкин","popularity":0.3141,"profile_path":"/r8w28abqC0gK252vFO2ggS7ByvS.jpg","credit_id":"5795161392514142a4004149","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2289075,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Boris Khaikin","original_name":"Boris Khaikin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb4af69c3a3685a14a9df2b","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2289080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonid Baratov","original_name":"Leonid Baratov","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/nlV4sNZpzfmNUxuguyIVptv8zMC.jpg","credit_id":"5cb4b0070e0a2677d1c1e4ac","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3978552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elena Macheret","original_name":"Елена Мачерет","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677558a863f90f8f6692bab6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0934394","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
