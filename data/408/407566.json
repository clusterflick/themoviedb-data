Staged by Marco Arturo Marelli, who sets it in a modern-day mining village, with the feel of a gritty modern drama, during the American gold rush of 1849. An unlikely setting for an Italian opera, but one that has a happy ending. It tells the tale of Minnie, the bartender in the saloon whom all the local men adore, and Dick Johnson alias Ramerrez, a notorious bandit. Dick and Minnie fall in love on first meeting, so much so that he vows to change his life as a bandit, sung by two contemporary great singers: Nina Stemme and Jonas Kaufmann. A new production from Marco Arturo Marelli brought one of Puccini’s rarely performed works to the Vienna State Opera stage in September 2013. Jonas Kaufmann in his role debut as the wanted and notorious bandit Ramerrez proves ideally cast, full of power, with his breathtakingly beautiful baritone timbre.","popularity":0.1295,"poster_path":"/vXcMSW8D7bVrgfrmfaRernJ4Uex.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unitel Classics","origin_country":""},{"id":4375,"logo_path":"/eo8fJbkpiz9Wdsl1qDSEX4GXeZH.png","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl of the Golden West","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Welser-Möst","original_name":"Franz Welser-Möst","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5791e6479251411e670000de","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Kaufmann","original_name":"Jonas Kaufmann","popularity":0.1606,"profile_path":"/phtOzy9kcTClC9mU7N6Mr2q1yFV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5791e658c3a368588900008c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1654371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Maria Stemme","original_name":"Nina Maria Stemme","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/xPONA1pC62I8c1lFeFTQh5huzgR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5791e667c3a368592500006e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomasz Konieczny","original_name":"Tomasz Konieczny","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":"/nUxtpbvwGZCbxrFhkj1Kuhw8dFm.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5791e6809251411f220000b7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orchester der Wiener Staatsoper","original_name":"Orchester der Wiener Staatsoper","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff94ec60cd32a003e4b3c8d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":958346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giacomo Puccini","original_name":"Giacomo Puccini","popularity":0.119,"profile_path":"/mAVi1Op8QWvu6QC63nb6tn1MXDm.jpg","credit_id":"5791e6119251411ff800003c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Felis Breisac","original_name":"Felis Breisac","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5791e5eac3a36858df00004d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Arturo Marelli","original_name":"Marco Arturo Marelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5791e5dc9251411e670000b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katherina Strommer","original_name":"Katherina Strommer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5791e5fd9251411f9e00004f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5647612","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vXcMSW8D7bVrgfrmfaRernJ4Uex.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1050}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
