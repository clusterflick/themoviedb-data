He takes the letter to the commanding officer with a request for a \"leave of absence,\" but Col. Colfax refuses emphatically. Paul determines to visit his mother at any cost, however, realizing the gravity of his offense at the time of war. He leaves the camp, does his filial duty, and while at home General Buchner and his aides from the Confederate side use the lower part of the house for a consultation as it is in the war zone. Paul manages to overhear an important plan to trap General Grant. He memorizes, gets through the lines, warns the great Commander in time, and is pardoned for his loyal desertion.","popularity":0.4292,"poster_path":"/gTImj74j0VL9RVMUW6fgLKmJ2jx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Loyal Deserter","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1059719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Nelson","original_name":"Jack Nelson","popularity":0.1447,"profile_path":"/287tmZiqPIXmMr1p88x2wBenWf2.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Paul Worthington","credit_id":"578ccb02c3a3685b44009916","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lafe McKee","original_name":"Lafe McKee","popularity":0.1904,"profile_path":"/iDR6BFkx3vJY9dN3LA3bNTAK24J.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Col.
