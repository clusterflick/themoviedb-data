Kaganof merely projected the old 1992 16mm footage onto a screen and recorded it with a digital camera in 2002.  For some reason, he opted to not use a tripod, so the camera constantly moves around throughout the short.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pale Blue Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aryan Kaganof","original_name":"Aryan Kaganof","popularity":0.0484,"profile_path":"/rUElkeHdGyUXje2Sl0ubwWNRKOj.jpg","credit_id":"5793ce7992514156e60019d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34584046","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2002-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
