A. R. veteran living with them. Dora makes up as well as she can to her grandfather for his loneliness and the two spend the greater part of their time together. On Decoration Day, Dora's parents want her to go with them to see the parade, but as they do not wish to take her granddad with them, she refuses to go and stays at home with him. After a while she coaxes the old gentleman with her into a field of daisies, where .she wreathes a crown of flowers and places it on his head. Seated thus in state, he is found by a delegation of citizens, who, having learned that he is a war veteran, bring a message that the town desires to honor him.","popularity":0.1038,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1913-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Only Veteran in Town","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Kent","original_name":"Charles Kent","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":"/aizKDALV8TFVBL3e1vV1UkcVHE7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"James Arnold, a G.A.R.
