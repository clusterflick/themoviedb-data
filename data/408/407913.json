Modest Mussorgsky's opera in prologue and four acts is performed by the Kirov Opera with performances from Olga Borodina, Alexei Steblianko and Sergei Leiferkust. Boris Godunov has obtained the throne of Russia by murdering the rightful heir Dmitry. An old monk, Pimen, witnessed this, and convinces his apprentice Grigory to avenge Dmitry's death. In the following years Grigory poses as Dmitry, raising an army against Boris, who is now convinced that he is being punished for the murder.  Filmed in Russia during the collapse of the Soviet Union, this particular production of Mussorgsky's 1872 tale of political upheaval is considered a highly unique and historical moment in opera. Robert Lloyd stars in the title role of Boris Godunov.","popularity":0.2282,"poster_path":"/3SfJI6OQ0NQRiQyzCrrO2ClaJkA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":13463,"logo_path":null,"name":"Philips","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":221,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boris Godunov","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","title":"Բորիս Գոդունով","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315310,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Valery Gergiev","original_name":"Valery Gergiev","popularity":0.0864,"profile_path":"/gn4dLa8vF0fdONol4hiHstSfK40.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self -
