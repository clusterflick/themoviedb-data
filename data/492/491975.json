Covering a vast area of coast, caves, mountains and forest, the park is inhabited by a massive concrete factory that branches through the landscape. Documenting the various layers of the sourced material, the factory body and the constructed landscape, the film looks at how time is physically embedded in the matter and how the molecular particles act in a circular re-shaping of the whole. The film merges 16mm footage shot in the area of Arrábida with 3D animation of the topographic landscape as an equal analogue layer. Há só uma terra. There is only one earth.","popularity":0.0927,"poster_path":"/ep7UGvVz3siulxNE8WUUn3VTNVy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2017-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arrábida","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1938630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tinne Zenner","original_name":"Tinne Zenner","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/upKFw4PxfmHQNlKx08Tg2DOqmB5.jpg","credit_id":"5a2d85db0e0a264cc114da25","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ep7UGvVz3siulxNE8WUUn3VTNVy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i49IGXGskguJaTriMSLvBhF73fU.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CPH:DOX","release_date":"2017-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Arrábida Trailer","key":"212095601","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-04-06T14:59:23.000Z","id":"5d6ca05befcea900149b01ae"}]}}}
