The film combines elements of horizontal and vertical montage in the soundtrack, using white noise, and radio static as a fragmentation device. The visually striking black and white photography weaves lyrical, pastoral nature with the de- and re- construction of civilization. No. 5 Reversal ends with a filmic signature, an image of its maker framed in front of a window against a backdrop of ruins.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/sHJyqk0zcSIGjRlH7NVGPAPxAdl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No. 5 Reversal","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2312532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorna Boschman","original_name":"Lorna Boschman","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/1StGwIRmAD3cWp3d7ZpeKxHDz7Q.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6600a95b3780620149389672","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4612965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Stanley","original_name":"Karen Stanley","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6600a9cf62f335017d52b960","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1650315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josephine Massarella","original_name":"Josephine Massarella","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/tRnFmpf2CSBbRXCy6bVCgkO0Q2S.jpg","credit_id":"6600a9e21b1f3c014996a9c0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1650315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josephine Massarella","original_name":"Josephine Massarella","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/tRnFmpf2CSBbRXCy6bVCgkO0Q2S.jpg","credit_id":"6600a9f03520e8017ed8d751","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1650315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josephine Massarella","original_name":"Josephine Massarella","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/tRnFmpf2CSBbRXCy6bVCgkO0Q2S.jpg","credit_id":"6600a9f8770700017c0e2a6d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1650315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josephine Massarella","original_name":"Josephine Massarella","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/tRnFmpf2CSBbRXCy6bVCgkO0Q2S.jpg","credit_id":"5a28b9aa0e0a264cc8116bc4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3561450","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lCebR8H6guy5wIeN8jxT8qEeBaR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sHJyqk0zcSIGjRlH7NVGPAPxAdl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
