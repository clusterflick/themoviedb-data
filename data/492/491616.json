Coaches shouldn't have to spend their first few weeks getting their athletes in shape; that's your job and that's where this DVD comes in! You have the choice of two different 30 minute workouts. Both are geared toward getting you stronger and faster. Workout one is a cardio workout that's tough but very doable. Once you press play, don't give up. Pay attention to Kelly's form tips and try to keep your energy at the same level as the other athletes on the workout. This workout is only 30 minutes so do your best...not more, not less! Workout two is a 30 minute athletic stretch session that is crucial to your speed and to ward off sports related injuries.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7bppEb3ROjgndgUWl2iHvZTYJfR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"30 Minutes to Fitness Athletic Conditioning Volume 1","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":777,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7bppEb3ROjgndgUWl2iHvZTYJfR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":542}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
