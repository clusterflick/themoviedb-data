He marries at 19 and enters the service of the local nobility. At 32, he becomes tutor to the Prince of Lu's children, eventually becoming a politician at 51. His career peaks are the roles of Lu's justice minister and eventually prime minister. The land prospers for four years, but Confucius grows disenchanted with court intrigues. For the following 12 years, he wanders the neighboring states, offering advice to their rulers.","popularity":0.9228,"poster_path":"/6wStLJE5RAeEuayBNveKZELJs31.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1996-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Heroic Elegy of Confucius","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Eiyuu Banka Koushi-den","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morio Kazama","original_name":"風間 杜夫","popularity":0.8834,"profile_path":"/x0DzJzdivusbFzNs0KNPXqhiH3M.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Confucius (voice)","credit_id":"5f692c2ca6e2d2003a5b6c48","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tessyo Genda","original_name":"玄田哲章","popularity":0.9741,"profile_path":"/7eJeYv2OCHKAadeFVdabVkpWldo.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Zigong (voice)","credit_id":"5f692c391b1f3c0039b1189e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masashi Ebara","original_name":"江原正士","popularity":0.8602,"profile_path":"/xJPCatQLQi75zc9YfWZo0gSpynq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Zengzi (voice)","credit_id":"5f692c551b1f3c0039b1194a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akio Otsuka","original_name":"大塚明夫","popularity":1.5694,"profile_path":"/uH9oiqOOgrsz2zNnouVZ1qPzDyb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Zilu (voice)","credit_id":"5f692c68cee2f600372dcab0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masako Ikeda","original_name":"池田昌子","popularity":0.5371,"profile_path":"/rwTLLiCs6xvX7RFLDsoQhgixLnd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nanzi (voice)","credit_id":"5f692c741b1f3c0039b11989","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Osamu Dezaki","original_name":"出崎統","popularity":0.5842,"profile_path":"/tvdC8XPko6xKME4ckNP1YsBUNZJ.jpg","credit_id":"5a29a7d40e0a264cc4112f9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.597,"height":851,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6wStLJE5RAeEuayBNveKZELJs31.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":508}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
