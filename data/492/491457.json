The water tank is a space that is frequented by the so-called ‘no-gooders’ of the locality, a place where they play cricket, play cards, drink and smoke up. When she enters the space with her camera, the boys are curious and at the same time wary of it and her. They sometimes resist, sometimes protest, and at times, open up. As the film unfolds we get a hint of the lives the boys lead and the fragile world they create for themselves at the water tank.","popularity":0.2264,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Turn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1724110,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Asheesh Pandya","original_name":"Asheesh Pandya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2a67a792514103291295e4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1937148,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pushpa Rawat","original_name":"Pushpa Rawat","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2a673f0e0a264cca1212d3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1937149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anupama Srinivasan","original_name":"Anupama Srinivasan","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2a677c0e0a264cc1120148","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1937148,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pushpa Rawat","original_name":"Pushpa Rawat","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6003e696cb3084003eddc724","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":34221,"name":"gender roles"},{"id":194226,"name":"masculinity"},{"id":204233,"name":"ethnographical"},{"id":226086,"name":"caste politics"},{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
