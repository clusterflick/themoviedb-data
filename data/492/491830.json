At the time, my son was 4 months old and I was spending a significant amount of time at home. Working under this circumstance, which I viewed as a convenience and a constraint, I made work that utilized and reconsidered the manufactured purpose of objects that I found in or near our apartment. In this case: a light bulb, microwave, mason jar, and a bath towel. I brought these objects together in an attempt to create a sense of self-entertainment through the production of a homemade magic show or no-frills special effect.\"","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Domestic Trick #4","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Lye","original_name":"Brian Lye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2c804592514103301396cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
