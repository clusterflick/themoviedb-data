A pyschedelic pioneer, author of Be Here Now, beloved spiritual teacher, and outspoken advocate for death-and-dying awareness, Ram Dass is now himself approaching the end of life.  Since suffering a life-changing stroke twenty years ago, he has been living at his home on Maui and deepening his spiritual practice — which is centered on love and his idea of merging with his surroundings and all living things.  Shot in a nuanced cinematic style, the film is an intimate summary of his life learning and awareness, and is ultimately a poetic meditation on life, death, and the soul’s journey home.","popularity":0.5292,"poster_path":"/ug7DAbB5k6HCah4LlFqPysBR8qA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103100,"logo_path":null,"name":"Further Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":22532,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tree Tree Tree Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ram Dass, Going Home","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":36,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Ram Dass -
