And then suddenly there is the vision of many whales rolling, breeching, twisting and turning in various play with eachother, a mother and baby slapping fins together, soforth. This film is about the identification with the world of the whale and the experience of the seeing, then (at the distance of being human), many killer whales in glimpses of our given sights of them.","popularity":0.0536,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moilsome Toilsome","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","credit_id":"5a2ce34c92514103331432f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0277900","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
