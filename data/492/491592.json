We go inside the peloton, we’re pushed up impossible climbs and forced down rapid descents, we lie alongside him in his hotel room in post-race agony. We ride in the support car, the source of comfort, supplies and fleeting relief from the cold. And we know that every mile traveled is a mile closer to the end.","popularity":0.0782,"poster_path":"/osITztQ0YR1ItZ6vzt4WNF4UKZ8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Race To The End","title":"Time Trial","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287995,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Kieran Gosney","original_name":"Kieran Gosney","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63624f34e18e3f007c1e67bc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486261,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Finlay Pretsell","original_name":"Finlay Pretsell","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2b3794925141032c133a57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4095988","wikidata_id":"Q55116600","facebook_id":"davidmillarfilm","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"TimeTrialFilm"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":2813,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/osITztQ0YR1ItZ6vzt4WNF4UKZ8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7EdmhM3ECsXAXcswtX5YgJ4cWdM.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":714},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"ca","file_path":"/3WDm5Ei31go9fhUrUqmqVxFxfKp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1452}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":180491,"name":"cycling"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IDFA","release_date":"2017-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Göteborg Film Festival","release_date":"2018-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"South by Southwest Film Festival","release_date":"2018-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
