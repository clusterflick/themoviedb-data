The girl and the younger brother were childhood sweethearts. His elder brother was considered the bad man and dead shot of the hills. The younger brother has been living in the valley for a long time and returns home to his family. He is now refined, educated, and, of course, a revelation to the little girl, who, though betrothed to the elder brother, is strongly attracted by him. Hence there is a renewal of childhood affection which the elder brother does not take kindly to.","popularity":0.895,"poster_path":"/6SsC45LfKNkv1vtVcjXUjmCEfli.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Feud in the Kentucky Hills","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Pickford","original_name":"Mary Pickford","popularity":0.6455,"profile_path":"/y0FHoj9AjmVveKkdeFuqhuVYaTf.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"The Daughter","credit_id":"5a27145292514103300eef54","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Hill Mailes","original_name":"Charles Hill Mailes","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/At3GtUXi9WLKero09JGxxVCY6Ph.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Father","credit_id":"5a27146492514103390f4c97","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Bruce","original_name":"Kate Bruce","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/oLC99DsB0gkPdsZJRi0d1D1B4hD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Mother","credit_id":"5a271476c3a3680b9a101f43","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Miller","original_name":"Walter Miller","popularity":0.264,"profile_path":"/sg0Ruah5XQ4UhBAIMeEISqSwlQJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"A Brother","credit_id":"5a27149292514103330f1e85","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Pickford","original_name":"Jack Pickford","popularity":0.1327,"profile_path":"/iSCajrPZY0pVD4gFrl1PsZyE2kr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"A Brother","credit_id":"5a2714a60e0a264cc10f28fa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Harron","original_name":"Robert Harron","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/8uqveFAwItcd5Ty2OEMPM37bbZb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"A Brother","credit_id":"5a2714cfc3a3680b9a101f9e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry B.
