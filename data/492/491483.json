The rumours circulated throughout the following year, but the Fourth Estate was less inclined in those days to disturb the privacy of those at the top of the tree. Eventually, the story made the papers, and Profumo made a statement to the Commons, denying impropriety over his relationship with Keeler. Three months later he was back, confessing that he had misled the House, and he resigned as an MP. But that was only the start of it.","popularity":0.3051,"poster_path":"/rGiv0FQjGqyN492fOtiSp1AjImK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1989-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Scandal Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1708627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Keeler","original_name":"Christine Keeler","popularity":0.227,"profile_path":"/6PWkUgColW8Wt1qFC03wCRr8x0N.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2a9eea925141033011ec1d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1937203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muriel Gray","original_name":"Muriel Gray","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/wijYgkLHHqFYmVn3h8RVo46bJbn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5a2a9eff9251410336128539","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1937204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Denning","original_name":"Alfred Denning","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2a9f0bc3a3680b8f125eed","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1937206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Edgecombe","original_name":"Johnny Edgecombe","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2a9f1d0e0a264cbe1235d9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":162414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Llewellyn","original_name":"Robert Llewellyn","popularity":0.2426,"profile_path":"/h5JPeWgRabledCjy0Wh61vAX3a0.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2aa02ac3a3680b8812ae07","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":136851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mandy Rice-Davies","original_name":"Mandy Rice-Davies","popularity":0.1118,"profile_path":"/q6mlPAFmQnSeaA06QS5kZFMjQ7u.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2aa03d0e0a264ccd12affb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73184,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Ward","original_name":"Stephen Ward","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/oFWoKhcOnJKiarOdx11hRqWTGtM.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"5a2aa04cc3a3680b9a136558","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1937211,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jon Silverside","original_name":"Jon Silverside","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2aa00c9251410336128628","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Orton","original_name":"Peter Orton","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2a9f51925141033011ec78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1937210,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andy Lipman","original_name":"Andy Lipman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2a9f6a0e0a264cbc12ccab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Orton","original_name":"Peter Orton","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a2a9fbf9251410333122589","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1448857,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Richard Gibb","original_name":"Richard Gibb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcf124cb34409003e3c480f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1557540,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chris Morphet","original_name":"Chris Morphet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcf1254b34409003d3ccecf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7250774","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.685,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rGiv0FQjGqyN492fOtiSp1AjImK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":240348,"name":"profumo"},{"id":240349,"name":"keeler"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
