But Nikolai Leskov’s short novel, which portrays Katherina as a monster, was only the starting point for Shostakovich to elicit understanding for an oppressed woman whose pursuit for self-determination is suppressed by society. Through combining satiric, grotesque and tragic elements in his music, Shostakovich succeeds in striking the balance between repulsion at Katherina’s immoral acts and sympathy for her. Violence, eroticism and the paralysing boredom of Russian society in the 19th century are the founding elements of this composition. The choir and orchestra of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino conducted by James Conlon accompany tremendous soloists such as Jeanne-Michèle Charbonnet, Vladimir Vaneev and Vsevolod Grivnov in the original language in this live recording.","popularity":0.0883,"poster_path":"/cNMxbaAxus4BLIUKCuvoCYKi2vz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthaus Musik","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":169,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Opera in 4 Acts","title":"Shostakovich: Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Vaneev","original_name":"Vladimir Vaneev","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Boris Izmailov","credit_id":"5dfcf5c6d236e600128aa627","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2154672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne-Michèle Charbonnet","original_name":"Jeanne-Michèle Charbonnet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Katerina Izmailova","credit_id":"5dfcf5ded236e600128aa65c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vsevolod Grivnov","original_name":"Vsevolod Grivnov","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sergei","credit_id":"5dfcf5ed8c7b0f0015fcc75f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Conlon","original_name":"James Conlon","popularity":0.0944,"profile_path":"/mQYnpol3yV53snbqy7ZMVn8qfcW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5dfcf627d1a89300148576ea","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lev Dodin","original_name":"Lev Dodin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfcf51026dac100175e3082","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":957523,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dmitri Shostakovich","original_name":"Дмитрий Шостакович","popularity":0.0876,"profile_path":"/oIut0fO6gtrf6jdEIqWMlbvgKsG.jpg","credit_id":"5dfcf524d1a8930012852be9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":957523,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dmitri Shostakovich","original_name":"Дмитрий Шостакович","popularity":0.0876,"profile_path":"/oIut0fO6gtrf6jdEIqWMlbvgKsG.jpg","credit_id":"5dfcf53426dac100145e59fd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1680558,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexander Preis","original_name":"Alexander Preis","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfcf5428c7b0f0018fcd953","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cNMxbaAxus4BLIUKCuvoCYKi2vz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
