These were military grounds and training camps, govern- ment buildings, natural parks where speculators have constructed illegal apartment blocks, nudist beaches... in Spain, Colombia, Ecuador, Russia and Australia. The catalogue of land- scapes which, for various reasons, Google Earth glosses over is endless and often very surprising. The project therefore confronts this unrealistic and yet supposedly objective view of Google Earth from a realistic (yet nevertheless subjective) point of view of the ground-level images we have of these places which, in spite of eve- rything, do exist.","popularity":0.0531,"poster_path":"/uxOy21TRwjtyBaGSaefccBTF83f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Places That Do Not Exist (Goggle Earth 1.0)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaki Lacuesta","original_name":"Isaki Lacuesta","popularity":0.1568,"profile_path":"/dmJkmADTUF00IQwZpJlYGH5BPdL.jpg","credit_id":"5df7e62a60975000212eb22b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1179639,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Isa Campo","original_name":"Isa Campo","popularity":0.203,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df7e63360975000152eb1ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uxOy21TRwjtyBaGSaefccBTF83f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
