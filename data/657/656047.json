The stories of Chris Hedges, a former New York Times war correspondent, and Riccardo Privitera, arms and equipment dealer for the now-defunct Talisman Europe Ltd, provide an unusual and disturbing context for shocking revelations about the industry of war. While interviewing Privitera and Hedges for Grimonprez’s recently released feature Shadow World (2016), it became clear that the two men were describing the same anguish and trauma, but from paradoxical perspectives. One has dedicated his life to unmasking lies, while the other has built his life on them. Both their personal and political histories gradually reveal the depths of suffering and duplicity, showing that the arms trade is a symptom of a profound illness: greed.","popularity":0.2901,"poster_path":"/gcvmh3RMVKiDQNkPVAWISEryfrS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6725,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zap-O-Matik","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2017-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Orchids","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Grimonprez","original_name":"Johan Grimonprez","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":"/8bsRdGhi7KcpHF8DKUG8Xa0AlRp.jpg","credit_id":"5df74ee5a6d9310017db90aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606317,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nicole Mackinlay Hahn","original_name":"Nicole Mackinlay Hahn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df74f0e26dac1001253f9ef","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2483473,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Torsten Goddon","original_name":"Torsten Goddon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df74f3426dac10014542cff","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Grimonprez","original_name":"Johan Grimonprez","popularity":0.0608,"profile_path":"/8bsRdGhi7KcpHF8DKUG8Xa0AlRp.jpg","credit_id":"5df74ef365686e001387268d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2483472,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alex Szombath","original_name":"Alex Szombath","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df74f0326dac10014542ca8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2032573,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarah d'Hanens","original_name":"Sarah d'Hanens","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df74f2965686e00138727a7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120546,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dieter Diependaele","original_name":"Dieter Diependaele","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df74f1cd1a89300127b687b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":71166,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karsten Fundal","original_name":"Karsten Fundal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5df74f3ea6d9310014db72a7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6556354","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gcvmh3RMVKiDQNkPVAWISEryfrS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
