A man of stark contradictions, Thevis by the 1970s commandeers a sprawling empire of smut from his base in the puritanical Deep South, while simultaneously running a plethora of legitimate businesses with a nearly all-female executive team. Craving respectability, he sinks millions into the arts, music, movies and charities but ultimately is bought down in a noxious web of murder, blackmail, arson and extortion.","popularity":0.0727,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Rumored","tagline":"","title":"Peachtree","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1484509,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anthony Maras","original_name":"Anthony Maras","popularity":0.0866,"profile_path":"/lTuavfsrkm0mJv2FNzJhe9UEukv.jpg","credit_id":"5dfcbc0765686e0015905f19","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1484509,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anthony Maras","original_name":"Anthony Maras","popularity":0.0866,"profile_path":"/lTuavfsrkm0mJv2FNzJhe9UEukv.jpg","credit_id":"5dfcbc1526dac100175dd41d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11570278","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
