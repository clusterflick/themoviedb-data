By 2050, at least one in four will live in a country suffering from water shortages - creating ideal conditions for a new market. Goldman Sachs, HSBC, UBS, Allianz, Deutsche Bank, BNP. Banks, investment funds and hedge funds are all rushing to invest billions of euros in anything related to water. A real monopoly of water has begun. From California to Australia, from New York to London via Marseille, we investigate the financialization of water. New power relations are being established and access to water is being threatened. It’s a battle taking place on many fronts: ideological, political, environmental, and of course, economic. The fate of nearly 10 billion inhabitants around the world depends on its outcome.","popularity":0.3245,"poster_path":"/oaN0AukqBBumfzO2cX8YK8p54YF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105852,"logo_path":"/8496jx3PA1EABhAO33sRy7zN49P.png","name":"Magnéto
