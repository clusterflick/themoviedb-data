But, the whip became a terror tool for Suro to control the village. Because his father left him, who died in the final fight, Kasan was advised by his mother to be a farmer. Kasan's effort to fertilize the land was considered a challenge by Suro, because Kasan succeeded in convincing other villagers. They even managed to make a waterwheel to drain water on their barren land. Another problem arises, Marni who loves and is loved by Kasan, disapproved of her father, Suro. Marni is set up with Karnen, Suro's subordinate. After being tortured by Karnen, Kasan learned to play the tip.
