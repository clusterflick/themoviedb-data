The picture plane is divided into a left and a right half.  A changing background is formed by colorful, highly graphic patterns reminiscent of TV test signals and various monochrome surfaces.  Two smaller rectangles appear on the surface, in which video sequences are running.  The two image strands show landscapes, interiors, objects, graphical images and text that are sometimes used in contrast, and on other occasions the same image can be seen mirrored in each rectangle.  They are accompanied by Hillâ€™s recitation of a long text, whose syllabic sequence determines the rhythm of the images (the screen changes with each uttered syllable).  His voice comes alternately out of the left and right stereo channels functioning like a dialogue.  This is broken into sections by a singing, but electronically altered, voice.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Primarily Speaking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1608281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gary Hill","original_name":"Gary Hill","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfcc279d1a893001284e651","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
