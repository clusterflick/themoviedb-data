When Polo, who claims to be his cousin, shows up with a backpack full of CVs, Gaspard's life is turned upside down. A few blocks away, Bob yells insults and je t'aime at Josianne's window to get her to open the door. Pierre-Henri Brahim spots him and thinks he's found a friend. Fred wanders the streets with his crazy leg. They all end up at Josianne's house, where they learn that she is to be evicted. On the bangs of society, each of the characters is a world unto himself. Extravagant and endearing, they are the protagonists of a social comedy that tackles the issue of social marginalization with caustic humor and a great deal of tenderness.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/4KfIpbEzDj9TfpSUDX0aYyxX1r1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Epi d'or","origin_country":""},{"id":128281,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cie Ophélia Théâtre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Des gens passent et j'en oublie","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2509720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salim Benayeche","original_name":"Salim Benayeche","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1dd74ae194b00012b9f095","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2509722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martina Coblentz","original_name":"Martina Coblentz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1dd76ba24c5000130c2984","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2509724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Delachaux","original_name":"Christophe Delachaux","popularity":0.1276,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1dd77f4df2910013c0753c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2509726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Christine Delhomme","original_name":"Marie-Christine Delhomme","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1dd7b695c0af0015126068","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2509727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frédéric Montfort","original_name":"Frédéric Montfort","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1dd7cd4df2910015c0ae13","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2509728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jérôme Plantevin","original_name":"Jérôme Plantevin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1dd7e2d5dbc20013f60439","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4318933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Thomas","original_name":"Henri Thomas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"65295bc8ea84c7014e0437a1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2509730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvia Tourlan","original_name":"Sylvia Tourlan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1dd7fae194b00014b998d1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2509731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascal Zeller","original_name":"Pascal Zeller","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1dd80495c0af00151260c2","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2485496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Poncelet","original_name":"Laurent Poncelet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfa6106d1a893001280a479","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11687506","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/4KfIpbEzDj9TfpSUDX0aYyxX1r1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b9W6wIjMCj7MdoGnAPp52fPbY3Y.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":774}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
