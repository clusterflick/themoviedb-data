Tensions mount as the guests exchange makeovers and hurl accusations. Tears in the bathroom lead to a ghostly kiss. In a circle around the Ouija board, they invoke a spirit. Their faces float in blackness. Five pairs of painted nails caress the planchette as it moves, swirling pale arms behind it. Our host becomes possessed. The characters overlap. Which of these women is not herself? Uzi's Party is a short experimental narrative written, directed and edited by Lyra Hill. All five characters are played by her sister Johanna Hill. Uzi's Party was filmed entirely in-camera on 16mm film, by means of intricately plotted multiple exposures and a cast of thirteen body doubles.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/s7XyQZ25gJYlOYWZuGA7Dw8Yx5f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uzi's Party","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2530604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Hill","original_name":"Johanna Hill","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e832137cb6db50012b1aadb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1778607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyra Hill","original_name":"Lyra Hill","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e83204104b596001792f2c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3838924","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8zcNKpmoAP4QuOYaqSHZCOMHXqt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wLk8PuWIUaxBSo8zBRtQAoL94xB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fmOXusFjbUpTC3o9wykimoV3Eoy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rmtEf8CEWxuOYwMrovBMvKE85P7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2940,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/s7XyQZ25gJYlOYWZuGA7Dw8Yx5f.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2940,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fbKotz8cnipuH4uasvMv3iF6PqJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263999,"name":"multiple exposures"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Chicago Underground Film Festival","release_date":"2015-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
