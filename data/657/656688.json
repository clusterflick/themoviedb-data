This film was shot in my mother's village in Southern Sri Lanka—shortly after the civil war in 2010. Collaboratively developed with members of my family there, a narrative was improvised around an investigation into my mother's interactions with spirits in the community during her childhood. Landing somewhere between horror fiction and “spectral” ethnography, the film describes a population reeling from devastations of the past, where distinctions between the living and the dead are thinning, and foreign influences loom over Sri Lanka’s commercial, economic, and media infrastructure.","popularity":0.047,"poster_path":"/p8y6GgwWdHGrf5KJrdpdVW4a41z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131815,"logo_path":null,"name":"Envy the
