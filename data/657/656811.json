He is also the main character in André Delvaux’s film, played by Gian Maria Volonte, for the movie adaptation of the same book in 1988. But what does Zénon represent for us today, and what has become of him? How can this entirely fictional philosopher, doctor, alchemist and inventor from the Renaissance help us understand the era in which he lived as well as our own in these uncertain times? This is what this documentary sets out to do.","popularity":0.191,"poster_path":"/vWV7F6Ti4noRsUTWTlaZaRpnJbL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2019-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zénon the Rebel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johan Leysen","original_name":"Johan Leysen","popularity":0.3145,"profile_path":"/pCBvrMKTNo6cqC63qDSipbtt2Rs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e3c60a60c2710001a788fae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Christine Barrault","original_name":"Marie-Christine Barrault","popularity":0.314,"profile_path":"/uKaE6e4u3IuhhYslqtmICc2GssY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"5e3c60e60c2710001a788fee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":239139,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marguerite Yourcenar","original_name":"Marguerite Yourcenar","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/nkS2dRZrY9JQ1z7vdAUdTAxW4sw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e3c61083dd1260013125f71","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Delvaux","original_name":"André Delvaux","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/tAaZAg4XmPnGICwWZF6c6Rj1nx1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e3c611bac8e6b001acb9ddf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gian Maria Volonté","original_name":"Gian Maria Volonté","popularity":0.4797,"profile_path":"/8SFKKlHsNZyfWzF5OVWVqP0dTEJ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5e3c61930c2710001377e651","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":592950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelica Ippolito","original_name":"Angelica Ippolito","popularity":0.1348,"profile_path":"/uTzZCxSZ5A1udkqQ7ztZOq6tHoi.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e3c61a90c271000157843c6","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1314024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Françoise Levie","original_name":"Françoise Levie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3c5ffe3dd1260015126275","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1314024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Françoise Levie","original_name":"Françoise Levie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3c60440c2710001377e366","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2251346,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anne Christophe","original_name":"Anne Christophe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3313a83d4d960036273e7c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338607,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Antoine-Marie Meert","original_name":"Antoine-Marie Meert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3313573d4d960037275ad0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11020328","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.741,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vWV7F6Ti4noRsUTWTlaZaRpnJbL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":227302,"name":"portrait of an artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
