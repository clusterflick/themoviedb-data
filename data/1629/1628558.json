After being denied a job they desperately need, the women form an unlikely alliance and take control by entering the city’s underground economy.  What starts as small hustles quickly escalates into calculated heists, risky alliances, and confrontations with powerful figures who control the streets. As their confidence grows, so does the danger. Loyalty is tested, past mistakes resurface, and every move carries real consequences.  Driven by ambition and survival, the women must decide how far they’re willing to go to secure power in a world that never offered them a fair chance. Gritty, cinematic, and unapologetic, Denied But Dangerous explores sisterhood, betrayal, and the cost of rewriting the rules when the system says no.","popularity":0.1286,"poster_path":"/6eA3jwepiqe4cERUn6r0n7jllms.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249899,"logo_path":null,"name":"On Point Entertainment Moguls","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"Denied opportunity.
