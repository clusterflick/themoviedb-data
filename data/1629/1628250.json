The episode comprises three independent stories of families returning home and facing major challenges in the process. All homecoming stories are different: some return due to success, some due to failure. Some set off alone and returned with a family. Some were homesick, some saw an opportunity coming home. The question in each and every case remains the same: will the ones who come back find their home again?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Will the ones who come back find their home again?","title":"Menjek/Maradjak: Édes otthon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7786596","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
