While neighboring Pasadena enforced redlining policies that kept Black families from owning homes, Altadena welcomed them with open arms. Here, African American families could finally put down roots, build equity, and pass something meaningful to the next generation. That legacy-decades in the making-now hangs in the balance. Beneath the Ashes shares the voices of those who lived it: homeowners who lost everything, renters searching for stability, business owners rebuilding from scratch, and community leaders fighting to preserve what took generations to create. Through intimate conversations and powerful storytelling, the film reveals both the pain of loss and an inspiring vision for what comes next.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beneath the Ashes: The Past Reimagined","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36286603","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
