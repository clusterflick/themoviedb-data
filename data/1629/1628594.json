Filmed in 1971, the film contrasts two Cuiva groups—one maintaining a traditional nomadic lifestyle, the other drawn into the Colombian economy—illustrating cultural and economic change brought about through contact with settlers and the pressures this contact places on their way of life.  (Note: Produced as an episode of the Disappearing World television series, the film is structured as a self-contained ethnographic documentary with its own title, subject focus, and production context, supporting its treatment as a distinct film.)","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/nSXqiXtrVnH0pF3PUQXub55ylcr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disappearing World: The Last of the Cuiva","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Last of the Cuiva","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1301100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Arcand","original_name":"Bernard Arcand","popularity":0.1178,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"698259826e86a1486970598c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1256905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Moser","original_name":"Brian Moser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69825999474a5eb270383211","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1256905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Moser","original_name":"Brian Moser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698259a1571c12d0b4383182","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1256905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Moser","original_name":"Brian Moser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698259aa9d861f09ad4c9b3e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5984169,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dai Vaughan","original_name":"Dai Vaughan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698259b59464c10d514c99b5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4801530,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruce White","original_name":"Bruce White","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698259c0d99852e77d4195a0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178977,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ernest Vincze","original_name":"Ernest Vincze","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698259c8ac93d85119e920d1","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2574982","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":855,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nSXqiXtrVnH0pF3PUQXub55ylcr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":570}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1971-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
