Work on this film began with the question of the feasibility of returning from West to East. The participants are our family and my father's friends. Some, like him, went to the West in 1956, while others remained in Hungary after the revolution. \"East... West... Home's Best\" deals with Central European life stories, belonging, rootlessness, homesickness, and dreams in the context of my personal respect for my own family and friends.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"East...
