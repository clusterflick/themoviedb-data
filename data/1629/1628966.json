Assigned this special mission, the “Dragon of Minami” uses his speed honed in buu mahjong and his teamwork with his wife, Ritsuko, to defeat one Kanto-based professional after another.  Meanwhile, Shoichi Sakurai, visiting the grave of a mahjong player he killed in retaliation for an underground match, encounters former opponent Hiromitsu Nishimura.
