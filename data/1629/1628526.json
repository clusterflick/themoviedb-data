He idolises the teachings of Don Bosco, whose legacy shows how one person's actions can catalyse meaningful change. Inspired, the boy begins to realise that waiting for \"someone else\" to fix things is a form of surrender - true power lies in personal initiative. Through symbolic imagery, he moves from paralysis to momentum: planting a sapling, clearing litter, rallying peers. The film underscores the message that even small acts-taken consciously and collectively-can scale into greater impact. In the end, the boy's transformation becomes a microcosm of global hope: change doesn't require perfection or grand gestures, just the courage to act to achieve.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Act To Achieve your dreams","title":"Act To Achieve","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5983860,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Mario Pimenta","original_name":"Mario Pimenta","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The boy who had a dream","credit_id":"69824160032eae1b93e0680f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5983860,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Mario Pimenta","original_name":"Mario Pimenta","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69823ab4d6c96710dee0680d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Director of Previsualization"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5983860,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Mario Pimenta","original_name":"Mario Pimenta","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69823b68d69e256bb0e06579","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38809577","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
