Led by a living person holding a cross, they look for the next naive victim that'll cross their path, to pass down the curse of leading the dead. In a small town in Galicia, a young delivery man comes across them on his way to drop off a mysterious package. Nevertheless, he continues, and once at the village where he must deliver the package, he'll find that nothing around these areas is usual.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":287643,"logo_path":null,"name":"SunriseCinema","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Galician","iso_639_1":"gl","name":"Galego"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The One Who Saw the Procession","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5978166,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hugo González","original_name":"Hugo González","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"69824eea2107fcfaaf3145db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5978163,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Carmen Saiz","original_name":"Carmen Saiz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"69824ef359bf2aef5d6cd39e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5976684,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miriam Kloub","original_name":"Miriam Kloub","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/odpOVFouSEGj3u6LTUhnXdOE4u3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"69824efac5a14d6cf5705859","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5976684,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miriam Kloub","original_name":"Miriam Kloub","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/odpOVFouSEGj3u6LTUhnXdOE4u3.jpg","credit_id":"69824f09eed2111f887059db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5976684,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miriam Kloub","original_name":"Miriam Kloub","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/odpOVFouSEGj3u6LTUhnXdOE4u3.jpg","credit_id":"69824f13d801d8983f4c9985","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
