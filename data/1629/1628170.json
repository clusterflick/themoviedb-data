A Way Out follows Safe House Project as they confront the reality of human trafficking in the United States and build a clear path to safety for survivors. The documentary centers on a simple turning point: a survivor makes a call for help. From there, the film tracks what happens behind the scenes as Safe House Project coordinates a rapid response, connects with survivor advocates, and works alongside law enforcement and trusted partners to move someone from immediate danger toward safety and justice. As the story unfolds, viewers see how a single call can set a nationwide network in motion, and how clarity, coordination, and courage can change the outcome for someone who feels trapped. The film balances the gravity of the issue with a strong sense of hope, showing ordinary people stepping into an extraordinary mission to make a way out.\r —Clay Vaughan","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"One call for help ignites a nationwide fight to end human trafficking.","title":"A Way Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5982556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Miller","original_name":"Daniel Miller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Director / Editor","credit_id":"69816d3e2728d0deb56ccf21","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5982557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristi Wells","original_name":"Kristi Wells","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kristi Wells","credit_id":"69816d54e16da42f86705488","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5982558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brittany Dunn","original_name":"Brittany Dunn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Brittany Dunn","credit_id":"69816d6a580ba0700ae91954","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5982559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lora Trent","original_name":"Lora Trent","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lora Trent","credit_id":"69816da1b54883ca323141d7","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5982561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clay Vaughn","original_name":"Clay Vaughn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Producer","credit_id":"69816e13f5a8a6a8b3705365","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5982562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Scott Dossey","original_name":"Robert Scott Dossey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Cinematographer / Director of Photography","credit_id":"69816e51f5a8a6a8b3705380","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39396638","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
