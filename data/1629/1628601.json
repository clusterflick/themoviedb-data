The film documents the Kula exchange system, a ceremonial network of inter-island gift exchange that structures social relations, travel, and status among participating communities. Produced within the context of Japan’s Our Wonderful World ethnographic television series, the film presents sustained observational footage of ritual activity and daily life associated with the Kula cycle.  (Note: Although produced for television within the Our Wonderful World series, the film is consistently cited in ethnographic filmographies, festival programs, and scholarly sources as a self-contained work with a distinct title, director credit, and runtime, supporting its treatment as a standalone film.)","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6755,"logo_path":"/bWiM2iY82B32NGmPCOFatgfekIR.png","name":"Nippon Television Network Corporation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Wonderful World: Kula – Argonauts of the Western Pacific","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Kula","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Kula – Argonauts of the Western Pacific","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
