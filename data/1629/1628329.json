Blurring the line between physical space and digital abstraction, it invites viewers into a shifting environment where light, sound, and movement construct — and deconstruct — impossible structures. As horizons dissolve and walls fold inward, the film transports us through a virtual wasteland, cold and desolate. Inside the ruins of this collapsed world, scattered within the void, a broken path is discovered, a road to nowhere is found.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":288137,"logo_path":null,"name":"TIND","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Architecture of the Void","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5983212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Pineau","original_name":"Francis Pineau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6981e82d5f783f96ba382f83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5983220,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Axophobe","original_name":"Axophobe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6981e916af1ac812a681c2c8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
