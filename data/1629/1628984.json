The massacres carried out by the Spanish and their gold rush initiate the process of colonization. Nicanor survives the oppression and murder of the original inhabitants of his country and later takes part in the struggles for independence. In modern times, he becomes one of the founders of the Sandinista liberation organization FSLN and is tortured and killed in the fight against Somoza's dictatorship. But his story continues: on the side of the victors, he works for the reconstruction of the country as a farmer, teacher, soldier, doctor, and student. Even after the Sandinistas' election defeat, he continued his struggle.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nicanor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5985774,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germán Téllez","original_name":"Germán Téllez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69834ccaedb87fd53162108d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5985775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josephine Renée Steenbock","original_name":"Josephine Renée Steenbock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69834ccfbfb1b8a12732e8ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
