Do you give them some or do you stare straight ahead pretending they're not there? How do you sum up a person in the span of a red light? When the Light's Red is a poignant and humorous take on one motorist's experience with intersection panhandling. It is an examination of the way in which privilege, power, fact and reality intersect inside our heads and outside our car window.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary, Short","title":"When the Light is Red 2007","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5983608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Wilson","original_name":"Keith Wilson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Director","credit_id":"69822273e16da42f8670586a","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2555780","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
