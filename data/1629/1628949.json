Humans haven't vanished - they're simply kept around because, ironically, they still make better coffee than machines. In this strange new era, JohnBot shape shifts into human forms to search for a purpose and secure a job, only to face rejection at every turn. As he drifts through a society reconstructed by machines, he begins to reminisce about the forgotten age when humans and AI coexisted, and quietly regrets that the war ever happened. Darkly satirical yet emotionally grounded, Job Needed explores identity, memory, and belonging through the eyes of a machine trying to fit into a future that no longer wants him - marking a bold step forward as Goa's first AI-generated film.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Job Needed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5985701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnbot","original_name":"Johnbot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Johnbot","credit_id":"6983455b5f412d855130147f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5983860,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Mario Pimenta","original_name":"Mario Pimenta","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/8CcFZfrh498hnW7x9KATMuaLEzA.jpg","credit_id":"69834537ec755b9038ded4d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39060140","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
