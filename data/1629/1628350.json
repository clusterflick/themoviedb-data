Eternal Habitat explores the profound connection between humans and the living spaces that shape them. Through a seamless spatial experience the film reveals the subtle, unspoken movement of space through time. It invites viewers to reflect on the interplay between the environments we inhabit, the transformations they undergo, and the fleeting moments of our lives spent within them.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eternal Habitat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Prokofyev","original_name":"Sergey Prokofyev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/jQQWoLALCqnQughZtHJNK9CskK9.jpg","credit_id":"6981ef3b62c0a40f1e81c029","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5983253,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aurélien Bello","original_name":"Aurélien Bello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6981ef7ea5a32d3df381c221","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
