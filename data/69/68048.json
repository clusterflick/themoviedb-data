It looks simple enough; a 100-watt light bulb, a motor, and a rotating cylinder with cutouts. Just sit in front of it, close your eyes, and wait for the visions to come. The Dream Machine enthralled mystics and freethinkers everywhere; Kurt Cobain had a dream machine, and William S. Burroughs thought it could be used to “storm the citadels of enlightenment.” With a custom-made Dream Machine in tow, director Nik Sheehan takes us on a journey into the life of Brion Gysin; his art, his complex ideas, and his friendships with some of the most eccentric counter-cultural icons. Taking the Dream Machine as the basis of its explorations, FLicKeR asks crucial questions about the nature of art and consciousness, and imagines a humanity liberated to explore its creativity in complete freedom.","popularity":0.7628,"poster_path":"/zjphH7UipHTCTR48NNfWEoIDVOW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Revolution in Human Consciousness","title":"FLicKeR","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":549583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Metzger","original_name":"Richard Metzger","popularity":0.1043,"profile_path":"/qop2hIdgxrtF54ex2Ygqr8JXljJ.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4782c3a368484e0caeff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brion Gysin","original_name":"Brion Gysin","popularity":0.1625,"profile_path":"/4eKK9AuOo6Eqs54d9vS53K4nkg4.jpg","cast_id":1001,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4782c3a368484e0caef3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6471,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William S.
