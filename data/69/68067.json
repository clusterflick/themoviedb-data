Set on a planet where the sun shines for just a few minutes once every nine years, this is a classic tale of suffering and forgiveness. A classroom full of young children are excited to hear that today the rain will stop. However, they are also resentful of a new classmate from Earth who remembers what it's like to see the sun.  \"This gripping, unsettling production softens the original storyâ€™s abrupt conclusion without diminishing its punch. A masterful work.\" - Booklist.
