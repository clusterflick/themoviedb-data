On display are never-before-seen archive images, historical reconstructions and important interviews with the pontifex's advisor, who was his confidant for 40 years. Testimony offers an exceptional insight into the personal and spiritual life of Karol Wojtyla, a man whose lifelong devotion to God and humanity ultimately earned him the title Pope John Paul II. The film is narrated by Michael York ('Omega Code', 'The Bible Series'), and accompanied by music by composer and Oscar winner Vangelis. Shot in secret, forbidden corners of the Vatican, 'Testimony' is full of new and fascinating revelations about the Pope.","popularity":0.7136,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2008-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Świadectwo","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael York","original_name":"Michael York","popularity":1.6727,"profile_path":"/tutdIz0uuQ6fyPMoQ4HpCgy2uQu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"65bcc243f03174016367ea17","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4384874,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Krzysztof Herdzin","original_name":"Krzysztof Herdzin","popularity":0.0339,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6563af347dfda6592ee67cd6","department":"Sound","job":"Orchestrator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4384874,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Krzysztof Herdzin","original_name":"Krzysztof Herdzin","popularity":0.0339,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6563af3bb234b9011c866ceb","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1399958,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paweł Pitera","original_name":"Paweł Pitera","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664e5a24585d5443a2639ba2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1399958,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paweł Pitera","original_name":"Paweł Pitera","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664e5a2c61c3cfb5b0639c9a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4730020,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paweł Ptasznik","original_name":"Paweł Ptasznik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664e5a55546ee791a3639961","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4730019,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gianfranco Svidercoschi","original_name":"Gianfranco Svidercoschi","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664e5a45f38ca42077cab548","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707258,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Kijak","original_name":"Robert Kijak","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"664e59de2305d297599b9cd4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3250964,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maciej Wróblewski","original_name":"Maciej Wróblewski","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679a12bba3fef657cda97358","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1869689","wikidata_id":"Q9395966","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":717,"name":"pope"},{"id":161207,"name":"catholicism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
