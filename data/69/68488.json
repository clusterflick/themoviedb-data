Fueled by Steinman's epic compositions, Todd Rundgren's grandiose production, and Meat Loaf's own soaring vocals, the singer's 1977 debut BAT OUT OF HELL elevated the rock-opera genre to appropriately theatrical heights with its extravagant orchestration and a melodramatic narrative celebrating teenage rebellion. This episode of the CLASSIC ALBUMS series recounts the making of this monumental work through interviews, archival footage, and live performances of album tracks such as \"You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth,\" \"Two Out of Three Ain't Bad,\" and, of course, the adolescent opus \"Paradise by the Dashboard Light.\"","popularity":1.7244,"poster_path":"/17W82O5uOltvLDjTkYv1Rh8MJrP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14519,"logo_path":null,"name":"Isis Production","origin_country":""},{"id":214,"logo_path":"/qIptM4dZBNflgv2OXzYECv8iQNH.png","name":"Eagle Vision","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Classic Albums: Meat Loaf -
