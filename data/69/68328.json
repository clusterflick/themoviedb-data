Twenty years have now passed, and the time has come for Hilarion to claim his bride. The Princess, however, has other ideas. She has set up a women's-only University - and men are not allowed. Hilarion and his friends, Cyril and Florian, disguise themselves as women to gain entrance to the University. All goes well until Cyril's unmaidenly conduct compromises their disguise - and reveals the three friends as intruding men.","popularity":0.4994,"poster_path":"/2kszz3KC1uPLXaXZr3kIP8ZwMTq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29143,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brent Walker Film
