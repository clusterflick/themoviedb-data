Now, having reached his 21st year, Frederic's indentures are at last over and he happily leaves the service of the pirates. When Frederic meets the beautiful Mabel, one of the many daughters (or wards in Chancery) of Major-General Stanley, they fall in love and decide to marry. However, complications arise when the pirates decide to marry the rest of the Major-General's daughters, themselves - and Frederic's birthdate turns out to be not all it seems.","popularity":0.5568,"poster_path":"/uOJ6dt0PSbi3wf4uNe1W0SRkHuP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29143,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brent Walker Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pirates Of Penzance","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Michell","original_name":"Keith Michell","popularity":0.2601,"profile_path":"/96CdOGsJ7JfdOxMm5Jw4jeoWCc3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Major General","credit_id":"52fe478dc3a368484e0cd2d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1143395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Oliver","original_name":"Alexander Oliver","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":"/gf5NLD1hmFQpTwbVwFr7iLwbtJZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Frederic","credit_id":"52fe478dc3a368484e0cd2d7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1143402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gillian Knight","original_name":"Gillian Knight","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ruth","credit_id":"52fe478dc3a368484e0cd2db","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1143403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janis Kelly","original_name":"Janis Kelly","popularity":0.0625,"profile_path":"/ozJDoQYA0Mrl0x7n2WRAXxvsoRG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mabel","credit_id":"52fe478dc3a368484e0cd2df","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1143404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Hudson","original_name":"Paul Hudson","popularity":0.0331,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sergeant of Police","credit_id":"52fe478dc3a368484e0cd2e3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1227911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Allen","original_name":"Peter Allen","popularity":0.2218,"profile_path":"/tN2G5sPmPzMKZZypwwbr90yeZyT.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Pirate King","credit_id":"5f09726c5e12000036e8fc6d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Donlan","original_name":"Brian Donlan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Samuel","credit_id":"5f0972931f98d100371e4ae1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":550670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Flowers","original_name":"Kate Flowers","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Jenny Wren","credit_id":"5f0972bd13a3200034752aee","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Fairbanks Jr.","original_name":"Douglas Fairbanks Jr.","popularity":0.4234,"profile_path":"/jjb8iJ0d419dVP2VTYzjy38FxXV.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self - Host","credit_id":"5f0972d4f48b340035fc9949","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1233957,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Judith de Paul","original_name":"Judith de Paul","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d9410dd100b600ff0bb2a0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4213281,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Walker","original_name":"George Walker","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d9412137109700c51b7e60","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64054,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Edward Simons","original_name":"Edward Simons","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d9413037109700c51b7e66","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3533021,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Derek Chason","original_name":"Derek Chason","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d9415e63aad2010022b03c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7732,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Allan Cameron","original_name":"Allan Cameron","popularity":0.1594,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d94171001bbd013aee8a7c","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17166,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Jenny Beavan","original_name":"Jenny Beavan","popularity":0.1871,"profile_path":"/yYBIJ0OsZu5ccnCC7Bim9FAkDwg.jpg","credit_id":"64d94179f495ee028f64e43c","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":550671,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodney Greenberg","original_name":"Rodney Greenberg","popularity":0.1476,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c89a1a59251410cd1c21305","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383797,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"W.S.
