This 19-track album contains all of their early-'80s hits, and while they aren't as energetic on-stage as they are in the studio, the band still perform with a great amount of flamboyance. The record is the Scorpions' only worthwhile live album and is a must for their fans.","popularity":0.2637,"poster_path":"/xwk09WITlyItVsCovIT6Bdpb6PC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Scorpions Live - Jan 23, 1984 - Feb 7, 1985","title":"Scorpions: World Wide Live","video":true,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Meine","original_name":"Klaus Meine","popularity":0.3032,"profile_path":"/xrohiYpNtvyMTQsUwVXr5g9uObj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"lead vocals","credit_id":"52fe47acc3a368484e0d3853","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthias Jabs","original_name":"Matthias Jabs","popularity":0.1573,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"lead guitar, backing vocals","credit_id":"52fe47acc3a368484e0d3857","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Schenker","original_name":"Rudolf Schenker","popularity":0.1277,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"rhythm guitar, backing vocals","credit_id":"52fe47acc3a368484e0d385b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Buchholz","original_name":"Francis Buchholz","popularity":0.0877,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"bass, backing vocals","credit_id":"52fe47acc3a368484e0d385f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herman Rarebell","original_name":"Herman Rarebell","popularity":0.1336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"drums, percussion, backing vocals","credit_id":"52fe47acc3a368484e0d3863","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xwk09WITlyItVsCovIT6Bdpb6PC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4344,"name":"musical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
