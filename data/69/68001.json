Illustrated in detail are how man and cats have become companions over the last 4,000 years and how the cat has never really been domesticated even though we think theyâ€™ve been. The familiar Ultimate Guide techniques are used to demonstrate why they can see in the dark, why they can jump so high and why they land on their feet. Also, explore a house with a 150 foot cat path that runs through the entire house, hanging from the ceiling.","popularity":0.0502,"poster_path":"/2y4bvnhXy6y8ZaFUOzx94g4iqnc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6790,"logo_path":"/A0TzRpnwLcUcNgrvDJ0BIajf56b.png","name":"Discovery","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ultimate Guide: House Cats","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2728,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2y4bvnhXy6y8ZaFUOzx94g4iqnc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1816}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
