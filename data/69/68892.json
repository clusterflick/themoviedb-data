There are three stories of persons with confused priorities (including a guy tying his shoe while parachuting); the world's first phone sex; and a clever, if dangerous, way to find a lost key. Except for the titles of each sketch and a couple of jokes that turn on noise, these are visual trips into the psyche of men, women, God, animals, and Time (the enemy of us all).","popularity":0.1675,"poster_path":"/gXbiOgCkOXNdnDz9KFqYyWSXZ55.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sex & Violence","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":18,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":554252,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Larry Eagle","original_name":"Larry Eagle","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47adc3a368484e0d3ceb","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126125,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Plympton","original_name":"Bill Plympton","popularity":0.4269,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47adc3a368484e0d3cdf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":554254,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anthony Arcidi","original_name":"Anthony Arcidi","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47adc3a368484e0d3cf7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126125,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Plympton","original_name":"Bill Plympton","popularity":0.4269,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47adc3a368484e0d3cd9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126125,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Plympton","original_name":"Bill Plympton","popularity":0.4269,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47adc3a368484e0d3cd3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":554251,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hank Bones","original_name":"Hank Bones","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47adc3a368484e0d3ce5","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":554253,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maureen McElheron","original_name":"Maureen McElheron","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47adc3a368484e0d3cf1","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0142833","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1283,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wwbQhkezv7NjfEtovOPd8FFEJMM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ea6KWPLe96lN03cLfTbAL6omDWL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gXbiOgCkOXNdnDz9KFqYyWSXZ55.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
