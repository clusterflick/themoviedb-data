Thanks to some brilliant underwater camerawork, we're treated to the sight of dolphins hydroplaning through 10 inches of water after fish, ramming one other in a quarrel over females, and evading a group of hungry orcas in Alaska. (Killer whales are actually part of the dolphin family, but they feel no compunction about feeding on their smaller cousins--not a scene for the squeamish!) But perhaps the most impressive part of this documentary are the scenes of a dolphin pod working in concert to trap a shimmering, mammoth school of sardines. Through calculated use of air bubbles, tail slaps, and sonic pips, the animals corral their prey and have a feast. The clever, and at times ruthless, nature of these mammals is on abundant display in this entertaining documentary","popularity":0.9565,"poster_path":"/aiDSEaLsruebdx3jyTIMONjzroC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Wild Side","title":"Dolphins: The Wild Side","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"National Geographic's Dolphins: The Wild Side","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stacy Keach","original_name":"Stacy Keach","popularity":1.6615,"profile_path":"/pxD1jmx9oAaV2lCLr87G3zRGv6i.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6304bcb2e860170079b8d1d6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1261812,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Atkins","original_name":"Paul Atkins","popularity":0.247,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe478cc3a368484e0cd0b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137880,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nicolas Noxon","original_name":"Nicolas Noxon","popularity":0.1071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653eea9cbc2cb300eafd8f58","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467610,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Grace Atkins","original_name":"Grace Atkins","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653eeae2cc968300ea719e0f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248183,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kevin McCarey","original_name":"Kevin McCarey","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653eeaf45907de00ac020a44","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177883,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Emmanuel Mairesse","original_name":"Emmanuel Mairesse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653eeb0b30813100ae61a524","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gBx20l71CObmweL1AiweQQD0Hlx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aiDSEaLsruebdx3jyTIMONjzroC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":630,"name":"dolphin"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hr","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
