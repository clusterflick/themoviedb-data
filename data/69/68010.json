Through the intimate portrait of four unique 'cat ladies' we create a sensitive and emotionally honest portrait of women whose lives and self-worth have become intractably linked to cats. It's not the number of cats that defines someone as a 'cat lady', but rather their attachment, or non-attachment, to human beings. They create a world with their cats in which they are accepted and in control - a world where they ultimately have value.","popularity":0.3307,"poster_path":"/cCF09rNoHRLuapk2dUtiC8tcbKj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chocolate Box Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When cats mean \"meow\" to you than people.","title":"Cat Ladies","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":550154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christie Callan-Jones","original_name":"Christie Callan-Jones","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4780c3a368484e0ca8af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1428171,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sally Blake","original_name":"Sally Blake","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/wkv5omijJSONZ8R2EP1CsltYgIA.jpg","credit_id":"654c4ffa49756000c6ebc2c0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1924252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Randström","original_name":"Stefan Randström","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654c4fe2d4653700e1a678c6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3320634,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Phil Strong","original_name":"Phil Strong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654c500d497560013b4faded","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90715,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mark Ellam","original_name":"Mark Ellam","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654c4fce532acb533883c23e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1428171,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sally Blake","original_name":"Sally Blake","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/wkv5omijJSONZ8R2EP1CsltYgIA.jpg","credit_id":"5f46fd43efca000035bd1712","department":"Writing","job":"Creative Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2756676,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeannette Loakman","original_name":"Jeannette Loakman","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/2ZjQFOIYXrizkRsBUI2ztuVcPiV.jpg","credit_id":"5f479367a2e6020034f40fbf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1447950","wikidata_id":"Q123527882","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zsDsyCQAJGD4BfE6zrYIt6Bb5vt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mywbUEOP0VgOfNnOmRsPDjKgC6d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":712},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cCF09rNoHRLuapk2dUtiC8tcbKj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1798,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AdVfiLrVd0lBv2hlxDOk9QOVzK0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":278130,"name":"cats"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Hot Docs Film Festival, Toronto","release_date":"2009-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hot Docs 2009 Trailers: CAT LADIES","key":"RCiRFVgXrOQ","published_at":"2009-03-25T16:46:57.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6bec3a368544800691f"}]}}}
