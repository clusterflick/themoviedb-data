Günter, the lord of the Rhine people, gives Siegfried a love potion that causes Siegfried to forget Brünnhilde and fall in love with Günter's sister Gutrane. Siegfried has given Brünnhilde the Ring as a token of their love, but her Valkyrie sister urges her to destroy it, because their father Wotan has lost his spear and power and is hiding out in Valhalla. Instead, Brünnhilde keeps it, and under the influence of the potion, Siegfried steals it from her. Enraged, Brünnhilde helps Alberich's son murder Siegfried, but Siegfried's memory returns, and he dies thinking of Brünnhilde. Brünnhilde repents and orders a funeral pyre to be built. She rides into the fire herself, and the Rhinemaidens get the ring back. The story closes with flames flickering about Valhalla in the background.  Filmed at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in June &amp; July 1991.","popularity":0.45,"poster_path":"/yVi6cLqiOMqNrz9O6Zd6C5gT0HN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bayreuther Festspiele","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1991-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":270,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ring Cycle: Gotterdammerung","video":true,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Wagner - Götterdämmerung 1992","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siegfried Jerusalem","original_name":"Siegfried Jerusalem","popularity":0.1909,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Siegfried","credit_id":"52fe47a5c3a368484e0d24ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bodo Brinkmann","original_name":"Bodo Brinkmann","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Gunther","credit_id":"52fe47a5c3a368484e0d24f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Kang","original_name":"Philip Kang","popularity":0.0583,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Hagen","credit_id":"52fe47a5c3a368484e0d24f1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günter von Kannen","original_name":"Günter von Kannen","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Alberich","credit_id":"52fe47a5c3a368484e0d24f5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Evans","original_name":"Anne Evans","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Brünnhilde","credit_id":"52fe47a5c3a368484e0d24e9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva-Maria Bundschuh","original_name":"Eva-Maria Bundschuh","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Gutrune","credit_id":"52fe47a5c3a368484e0d2519","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":553684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Waltraud Meier","original_name":"Waltraud Meier","popularity":0.2063,"profile_path":"/pk4rLWSbJmsKqxkoYFPm16re0zC.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Waltraude","credit_id":"52fe47a5c3a368484e0d24fd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":553661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Birgitta Svendén","original_name":"Birgitta Svendén","popularity":0.1175,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"1.
