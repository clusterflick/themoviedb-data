The first section features Anthony and Jenny and traces the father-son bond that develops between Anthony and his newborn son over 30 years. The second story centers on the affairs of an airline pilot who shares a house but not a life with his wife. He crosses paths with an unusual woman and spends an extraordinary night with his son. The final chapter follows the homecoming of Elliot to his estranged family. As his father dies, Elliot meets and falls in love with a woman who sees past his tough-guy exterior.","popularity":2.7481,"poster_path":"/fdmTzA59neAY4Xjh2n9knyGvQCn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5861,"logo_path":null,"name":"Showtime
