Five cups of coffee and two ashtrays are in front of him; he drinks and smokes. Steven joins him. They start a conversation about cigarettes and coffee. Steven likes to drink coffee before he sleeps, so he can dream faster. The conversation jumps around. \"You know my mother?\" asks Roberto. Steven describes coffee Popsicles. They switch seats; then switch back. Steven has to leave for a dental appointment he's not looking forward to. Roberto makes a startling offer, inspired no doubt by the coffee and cigarettes.","popularity":1.0533,"poster_path":"/ndGeSVCT1yLl1Mbcvx0yxJPcx6p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49393,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinesthesia Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coffee and Cigarettes","video":false,"vote_average":6.905,"vote_count":116,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Coffee and Cigarettes: Strange to Meet You","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Benigni","original_name":"Roberto Benigni","popularity":1.4182,"profile_path":"/ba1Sg02XxCphu6E1dWDMAH1GzeE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Roberto","credit_id":"577ee7f09251413a5b000267","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Wright","original_name":"Steven Wright","popularity":0.4518,"profile_path":"/9Q9buDjfm6uq0VE86MZ01o96lyG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Steven","credit_id":"577ee8029251413b0c000230","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Jarmusch","original_name":"Jim Jarmusch","popularity":0.5434,"profile_path":"/iMpIrvhoO9SZWhiDkSzaUt9Yd4N.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4797c3a368484e0cf6d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Benigni","original_name":"Roberto Benigni","popularity":1.4182,"profile_path":"/ba1Sg02XxCphu6E1dWDMAH1GzeE.jpg","credit_id":"5795df60c3a36866fe0048af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Jarmusch","original_name":"Jim Jarmusch","popularity":0.5434,"profile_path":"/iMpIrvhoO9SZWhiDkSzaUt9Yd4N.jpg","credit_id":"5795df68c3a36829ab008067","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Wright","original_name":"Steven Wright","popularity":0.4518,"profile_path":"/9Q9buDjfm6uq0VE86MZ01o96lyG.jpg","credit_id":"5795df6ec3a36829ab00806e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Ziller","original_name":"Paul Ziller","popularity":0.4054,"profile_path":"/yt8rTpN2EW9BmmxGyOZbC1ZGMgf.jpg","credit_id":"6420592323be460082b27f0b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom DiCillo","original_name":"Tom DiCillo","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/z8XD6BdliptWiaGP49yYNR2OTTR.jpg","credit_id":"642058fd534661008579db2f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6406,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Melody London","original_name":"Melody London","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642059156a3448008625695f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4834,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jim Stark","original_name":"Jim Stark","popularity":0.3207,"profile_path":"/xph5W8hp7CtVUj8qyzO8gURmmfB.jpg","credit_id":"642058ee8d22fc007cff801b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0090861","wikidata_id":"Q1404151","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n8CHg98lrDoSrdk1pB3h5bj6rA3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cr6ONO83XOr4t33Got8Fk7uyvvB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ndGeSVCT1yLl1Mbcvx0yxJPcx6p.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1925,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/x2njgycQKNum1EUnoZg9x8Z7C0o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1283}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Roberto Benigni and Steven Wright (Coffee and Cigarettes) \"Strange to Meet You\"","key":"pBa-2nXCc7g","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2013-07-30T07:20:40.000Z","id":"6420616e8d22fc00cc0edc54"}]}}}
