Local legend states that if you perform a specific ritual in the barn and the old house up the road, you'll see visions of Zeke Ashbrooke, a farmer who went mad and hung himself, his wife and children. Rumour has it that Zeke's wife - now known as The Dark Lady - still roams the woods of Blood Creek. This summer five young campers will venture to Blood Creek and accept a dare that could cost them their lives.","popularity":0.18,"poster_path":"/u0dfQDnVl147hY3p6FSHEVQAAMl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2006-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Dare That Could Cost Them Their Lives","title":"Blood Creek","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Dineen-Porter","original_name":"David Dineen-Porter","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"James","credit_id":"52fe479cc3a368484e0d0a51","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Tonkin","original_name":"Ryan Tonkin","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/lGHsuQY0UYwS0S0Nm14qU6rMXay.jpg","cast_id":1004,"character":"Kyle","credit_id":"52fe479cc3a368484e0d0a55","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelica Montesano","original_name":"Angelica Montesano","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1005,"character":"Lara","credit_id":"52fe479cc3a368484e0d0a59","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":212442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Morris","original_name":"Ashley Morris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Sheryl","credit_id":"52fe479cc3a368484e0d0a5d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Perry Mucci","original_name":"Perry Mucci","popularity":0.2204,"profile_path":"/4z8aIXxBL9EwVukgEXIUUbYvC1E.jpg","cast_id":1007,"character":"Dickie","credit_id":"52fe479cc3a368484e0d0a61","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4118920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scotty Newlands","original_name":"Scotty Newlands","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1009,"character":"Eric (as Scott Cameron)","credit_id":"648f68f242bf0100e49f40e7","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553376,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Lazar","original_name":"Robert Lazar","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe479cc3a368484e0d0a47","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553377,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniel Wener","original_name":"Daniel Wener","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe479cc3a368484e0d0a4d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean Cisterna","original_name":"Sean Cisterna","popularity":0.1363,"profile_path":"/xuTpWER5Q5COGS0dARVRHOZxIHS.jpg","credit_id":"52fe479cc3a368484e0d0a41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0796305","wikidata_id":"Q9174531","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":764,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bDtwbIUP9CLNd5Dw87DCVVtYVIK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":508},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":762,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u0dfQDnVl147hY3p6FSHEVQAAMl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":508}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
