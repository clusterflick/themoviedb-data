The group was born on December 16, 1976, at a surprise concert at the American Center in Paris. Four instrumentalists, four self-taught, four musicians untroubled by the successive waves of fashions from across the Atlantic and the Channel: Jean-Louis Aubert, singer and songwriter; Louis Bertignac, guitarist; Richard Kolinka, drummer; Corinne Marienneau, bassist. From titles: “Métro c'est trop”, “La bombe humaine”, “Crache ton venin”... Portraits and interviews, trances and crowd-pleasers at the Palais des Sports and the Fete de l'Humanité, a look behind the scenes. Jean-Marie Périer, with seven cameras in hand, now captures the phenomenon in a feature-length film. Camera movements, editing on a giant triple screen and Dolby Stereo sound all serve to highlight the quartet's harmony and vitality.","popularity":0.5768,"poster_path":"/tamTHVlcf2fLdxd3C5OqTTtUb67.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1980-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Public Telephone","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Louis Aubert","original_name":"Jean-Louis Aubert","popularity":0.106,"profile_path":"/vbnMYXGWvv658V6i0BCGFQOiu2Y.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53e5dbd20e0a2628db001494","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":568431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corine Marienneau","original_name":"Corine Marienneau","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":"/vS2yFOFjiIwElSGGxacVuzfUaOE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53e5dc260e0a2628db00149f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1351391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Kolinka","original_name":"Richard Kolinka","popularity":0.2822,"profile_path":"/ex2ZX8VtZp25GYd3P8BuxbsN5qB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53e5dc3f0e0a2628d8001455","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Bertignac","original_name":"Louis Bertignac","popularity":0.151,"profile_path":"/aJIzRL2jsLSf5t1jcBe2aIQGEB0.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a93480ac3a36824f6026885","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1423982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Marie Périer","original_name":"Jean-Marie Périer","popularity":0.1244,"profile_path":"/f04gMhRkdEFLmIR4PLbi9v2OY97.jpg","credit_id":"60d18e57bf31f2005d189958","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0204702","wikidata_id":"Q3546639","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u8AvY6VzSndBmO4Wvr5n3eBwIIp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3e7cNxQbyv9EGdHpVjrdtJn530g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/tamTHVlcf2fLdxd3C5OqTTtUb67.jpg","vote_average":2.542,"vote_count":4,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/dgGp5JKt9ytQo3Aq3G2z2bjf9UO.jpg","vote_average":1.434,"vote_count":5,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ArSslhXbYxMJL6wFi8hP5LPBgkE.jpg","vote_average":0.958,"vote_count":4,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":578,"name":"rock 'n' roll"},{"id":4434,"name":"interview"},{"id":9249,"name":"backstage"},{"id":10229,"name":"singer"},{"id":9817,"name":"behind the scenes"},{"id":18001,"name":"rock band"},{"id":154866,"name":"archive footage"},{"id":204236,"name":"music tour"},{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"},{"id":250883,"name":"french music"},{"id":270871,"name":"behind the music"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":302127,"name":"famous song"},{"id":318730,"name":"live concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2009-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Blu-Ray","release_date":"2025-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
