He and Grace have long since stopped communicating. As Grace confronts a series of small absurdities in her apartment building, Lukas finds himself unable to complete even the simplest of daily tasks. When something truly heartbreaking happens in a family, the deepest response is often unspoken.","popularity":0.1564,"poster_path":"/vTtu8d6CfavWQjMuftwTkOfhAU4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":865,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motel Films","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":3040,"logo_path":"/aZww3B7RCFAMV1qrDZDrdeB8qcI.png","name":"Versus Production","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2008-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unspoken","video":false,"vote_average":2.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","title":"Non-dit","type":"French title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuelle Devos","original_name":"Emmanuelle Devos","popularity":0.3593,"profile_path":"/bX1l2sTxoXVMRBky7rfD3lVEHud.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Grace","credit_id":"52fe478ec3a368484e0cd857","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Todeschini","original_name":"Bruno Todeschini","popularity":0.2218,"profile_path":"/gDyctO2bjftYvS1nEnIu8i5KKxu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lucas","credit_id":"52fe478ec3a368484e0cd85b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1427616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Déborah Amsens","original_name":"Déborah Amsens","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/nyn60w3NNbOvFjtU5CAYql79yzi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sylvie - swimming pool girl","credit_id":"5755b91c9251417e7c0004c2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1631529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chloé Henry","original_name":"Chloé Henry","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":"/wC7IUkGVlkoDZxWc58U1e2nePJA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Waitress","credit_id":"5755b95cc3a368091c0003d0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joffrey Verbruggen","original_name":"Joffrey Verbruggen","popularity":0.1501,"profile_path":"/4e5BtuixjtutmCU9J3gLwNnrVos.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Benjamin","credit_id":"5755b9d7c3a3687aea0004a1","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":439442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fien Troch","original_name":"Fien Troch","popularity":0.1036,"profile_path":"/391cWN3qMLNfbkuuT9ydcyMtp2v.jpg","credit_id":"52fe478ec3a368484e0cd853","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":952510,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Antonino Lombardo","original_name":"Antonino Lombardo","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f85d770284200069942fb9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19989,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ludo Troch","original_name":"Ludo Troch","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f85d9e39756100a3a45dfb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":439442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fien Troch","original_name":"Fien Troch","popularity":0.1036,"profile_path":"/391cWN3qMLNfbkuuT9ydcyMtp2v.jpg","credit_id":"5755ba0a9251417e73000497","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1150106,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Frank van den Eeden","original_name":"Frank van den Eeden","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/3NHfYnj6pPtsdb0pEIxAOPXvF0X.jpg","credit_id":"67872b022256023dfd4eb0d0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1194628","wikidata_id":"Q2506889","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vTtu8d6CfavWQjMuftwTkOfhAU4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":849}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
