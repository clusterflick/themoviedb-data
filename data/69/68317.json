When director Jens Schanze confronts his mother with her father's past, decades of silence have passed. The information that emerges about grandpa does not fit with the loving father that Jens' mother always talked about. Jens and his four older sisters never met their grandfather; he died in 1954. Jens' mother is in her seventies when her son, born in 1971, starts to poke around in the family history. She agrees to a critical examination of her father. Secrets hidden for over 60 years finally come to light. As they uncover the truth, this perfectly normal family goes through a highly emotional journey. Most shaken is the mother; her story of discovery is at the center of the film.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":665,"logo_path":"/bUomMJoEX2W7XpgvNeWswCFKzrW.png","name":"Hochschule für Fernsehen und Film München","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":237290,"logo_path":"/ybY4aLZxf7jcFDizkFTntgTjsQr.png","name":"ZDF/3sat","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winterkinder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Winterkinder - Die schweigende Generation","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jens Schanze","original_name":"Jens Schanze","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67fcb724de5e4dec62ae2a0b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jens Schanze","original_name":"Jens Schanze","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe478dc3a368484e0cd299","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jens Schanze","original_name":"Jens Schanze","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fcb6ad3110bd82dfad231d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jens Schanze","original_name":"Jens Schanze","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fcb6b97c29ae5bc3d9357c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012255,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Börres Weiffenbach","original_name":"Börres Weiffenbach","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fcb6d47c29ae5bc3d9358d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550847,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jens Schanze","original_name":"Jens Schanze","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fcb70dde5e4dec62ae29f6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0478326","wikidata_id":"Q85671231","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
