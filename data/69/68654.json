FRAGILE is a short parable about the things we often take for granted until they are gone, like friendship and love from those that are close to us. It is a film about the precious gift of life, and the fragility of our existence. Death, its imminence and certainty despite our efforts to deny it, is examined in a meditative manner. FRAGILE entertains by means of serious reflection and lyrical contemplation.","popularity":0.1253,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2003-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fragile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helga Göring","original_name":"Helga Göring","popularity":0.166,"profile_path":"/wYEANj60LJSz6jnvNarcXk5gbV5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kathrin's Mother","credit_id":"52fe479cc3a368484e0d0957","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Hechler","original_name":"Sophie Hechler","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Carla","credit_id":"52fe479cc3a368484e0d095b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joachim Nimtz","original_name":"Joachim Nimtz","popularity":0.1439,"profile_path":"/1wZySkFd1qgMwwZCtYDeBEAZurW.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Angel","credit_id":"52fe479cc3a368484e0d0963","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":553311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Verena Rendtorff","original_name":"Verena Rendtorff","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Christoph's Assistent","credit_id":"52fe479cc3a368484e0d095f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28943,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sikander Goldau","original_name":"Sikander Goldau","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe479cc3a368484e0d094d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":28943,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sikander Goldau","original_name":"Sikander Goldau","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe479cc3a368484e0d0953","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0388953","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
