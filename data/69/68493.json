He sees a threatening shape, but it turns out to be a cache of bones. He grabs one and settles in contentedly. A rat sneaks on, and Pluto springs into action. The rat toys with him, until it finds the officer's mess. He bribes Pluto, until he hears an officer approaching. The rat hides, and Pluto gets thrown in the brig, while the rat sneaks off with his sandwich. But Pluto gets even.","popularity":0.4421,"poster_path":"/ogA6xBDaewsRrVbQjJdMbtCMUP1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dog Watch","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":19,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Perro vig√≠a","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Pluto marinaio","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Pluto vakthunden","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pinto Colvig","original_name":"Pinto Colvig","popularity":0.3687,"profile_path":"/jslBLHuV1cOKsyx763CA1RqsrQU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pluto","credit_id":"559922d69251411d49001747","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles August Nichols","original_name":"Charles August Nichols","popularity":0.3951,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4795c3a368484e0cefd3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"559922ee92514109db0015d6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150755,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"George Nicholas","original_name":"George Nicholas","popularity":0.1352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559922fa925141564a00191b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150758,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Marvin Woodward","original_name":"Marvin Woodward","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5599230fc3a36855db002cf3","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1015864,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Norman Tate","original_name":"Norman Tate","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55992305c3a3685f80001b05","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":562127,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eric Gurney","original_name":"Eric Gurney","popularity":0.1132,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5599233892514155d60018e7","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64868,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oliver Wallace","original_name":"Oliver Wallace","popularity":0.1098,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55992354c3a3685f5a00181e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150117,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Claude Coats","original_name":"Claude Coats","popularity":0.0869,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55992324c3a3684baa0018c1","department":"Art","job":"Background Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Bushman","original_name":"Bruce Bushman","popularity":0.098,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5599232e9251411d49001759","department":"Directing","job":"Layout"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":551639,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jerry Hathcock","original_name":"Jerry Hathcock","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5599231ac3a3684baa0018be","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0037649","wikidata_id":"Q3392762","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k92troVqGgUDOCEPOmB8DyjbGpb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":822,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ogA6xBDaewsRrVbQjJdMbtCMUP1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":547},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ylQTGZyaDrriwMtbrURm4QPwGBG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/jnj89MuopPGdwMtHNrkgjlN46jD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":189359,"name":"rat"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1945-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
