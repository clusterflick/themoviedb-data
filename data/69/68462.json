As young martial artists Mike Chaturantabut and Matt Mullins fight their way through the world's most prestigious tournament, East meets West in a stunning application of visual technologies and the biomechanical secrets behind the world's martial arts are revealed for the first time. Using a unique graphic technique that allows for \"in-the-body\" animation of joints and muscles, experts demonstrate the basic principles behind muscular torque and leverage - creating fighting and sparring scenes unlike anything you've ever seen. Weapon masters showcase the physics behind the fiercest weapon styles - the twin broadswords, the Chinese straight sword and the Katana - and demonstrate how warriors can quickly master even common household items - like a traditional Japanese hand fan - to devastate their opponents.","popularity":0.1347,"poster_path":"/82wwovP48IFWTJlFsF36vhxLxPe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6790,"logo_path":"/A0TzRpnwLcUcNgrvDJ0BIajf56b.png","name":"Discovery","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"XMA: Xtreme Martial Arts","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2862413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Boyd","original_name":"Jonathan Boyd","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fb6dcc66ee3d70041994410","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1324263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Chaturantabut","original_name":"Mike Chaturantabut","popularity":0.1012,"profile_path":"/6kh7aitymBygLF7V9fvYe9Ka8Ld.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fb6dce4e24e3a00413cb4c4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":84972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Brenkus","original_name":"John Brenkus","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb6dd0a76eecf003e73b1b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2862414,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Brenkus","original_name":"John Brenkus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb6dd1cf794ad003ba79e5e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2862418,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Stern","original_name":"Michael Stern","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb6dddd967cc7004016a790","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0421012","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kUIx2XsC3910IUasWq7gAQRCYDU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1366}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/82wwovP48IFWTJlFsF36vhxLxPe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":779,"name":"martial arts"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
