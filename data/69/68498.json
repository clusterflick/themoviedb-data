Mickey throws Pluto's ball into the jungle, and he chases it but it looks exactly the same as an armadillo that's rolled up into a ball. This, of course, greatly confuses Pluto for a while. But he eventually makes friends with the armadillo. He chases the critter into a cave right behind his ball, and rips the ball apart thinking it's the armadillo, which makes him very sad until the armadillo shows up again.","popularity":0.5078,"poster_path":"/nGqkKJjlNfkCh2m7fLVsMfIa5kG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pluto and the Armadillo","video":false,"vote_average":6.104,"vote_count":24,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Pluto y el armadillo","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Pluto e l'armadillo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pinto Colvig","original_name":"Pinto Colvig","popularity":0.3687,"profile_path":"/jslBLHuV1cOKsyx763CA1RqsrQU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pluto","credit_id":"56086eea9251415469000c49","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":566738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Shields","original_name":"Fred Shields","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/qPPgNgjClaEDvRoxtFMan2vuUu9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"56086ef4c3a368120500602d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mickey","credit_id":"64e91f01c3c89100e3604c52","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64864,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Clyde Geronimi","original_name":"Clyde Geronimi","popularity":0.5443,"profile_path":"/eAeqN6fPYuzKjGRSaR2jqhSeeMq.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4796c3a368484e0cf0f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"5689ae7cc3a36860e90283b6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0036269","wikidata_id":"Q3392763","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nW78wraso46N4GN8YH8cnZ216I8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nGqkKJjlNfkCh2m7fLVsMfIa5kG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1997},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vZbHf4NH5BYclkG0NbY6amBAWwN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u4VYJQfX5pJwNvbWXrkpvIZc5rS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/11sbw29RCLVxFB4MfxeqG9O3RJL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14587,"name":"armadillo"},{"id":18266,"name":"south america"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1943-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
