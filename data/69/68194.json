It was released in DVD format on the Warner Brothers label on March 9, 2004. This concert is perhaps most notable for a performance of the song \"Country Feedback\", which Michael Stipe opens by declaring it his \"favorite song\". The rendition features appended lyrics from another song, Reveal's \"Chorus and the Ring\", and a guitar solo by Peter Buck, neither of which are in the original. Other concert highlights include the appearance of two then-new songs, \"Bad Day\" (Also originally known as PSA when first written in the early 1980's) and \"Animal\", and the re-emergence of the long-lost song \"Permanent Vacation\". \"Permanent Vacation\" dates back to 1980, years before their first album, while \"Bad Day\" dates back to 1985.","popularity":0.7406,"poster_path":"/70RQho9BJBLx6jJslQeGTGs3viv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51127,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warner Vision Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":12870,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scarlet Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":143,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"R.E.M. performing 23 songs in Wiesbaden, Germany, on 2003-07-19.","title":"R.E.M. : Perfect Square","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"R.E.M.: Perfect Square","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Stipe","original_name":"Michael Stipe","popularity":0.2504,"profile_path":"/ooBrKtelltirieu14MmxW7cLS4X.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Vocals","credit_id":"552bde77925141288b0028b8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Mills","original_name":"Mike Mills","popularity":0.2484,"profile_path":"/69f9zCc4Boh7DmOMTBAKdcfmC98.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"65fa3493770700016305b3de","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Buck","original_name":"Peter Buck","popularity":0.2622,"profile_path":"/l8S4KPhIQDylu8ZuNoeQGasF6O3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Guitar","credit_id":"552bde63c3a3681f56007ce0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":559379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Berry","original_name":"Bill Berry","popularity":0.1285,"profile_path":"/duzd6kCoHX7Nyzdxrm6LqdWDEPn.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5eed765f0f1e580035b86390","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":126414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Knowles","original_name":"Julia Knowles","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552bde27925141288b00288f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1091554,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sharon Ali","original_name":"Sharon Ali","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552bde37c3a368596e00657c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":22406,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ray Still","original_name":"Ray Still","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"552bde48c3a36858d6006405","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0423027","wikidata_id":"Q2626715","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/70RQho9BJBLx6jJslQeGTGs3viv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.69,"height":1450,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/g68zWROAI89XoosVLpwaweykLy8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":209087,"name":"alternative rock"},{"id":211728,"name":"jangle pop"},{"id":211729,"name":"college rock"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
