Of course, once Pluto smells the scent of the roast, he makes a beeline for the kitchen. Unfortuantely, staying undiscovered proves difficult for Pluto once he gets inside particularly after he inhales a bucket of soapy water and starts sneezing.

The maid just shrugs and says, \"I could swear it was that dog.\"","popularity":0.2651,"poster_path":"/il2ZKZMREOQqk0O5ypYnwh4KGPG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1940-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pantry Pirate","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":18,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El pirata de la despensa","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Pluto pirata in cucina","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Pluto Ã¤r hungrig","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Vorratsschrankpirat","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Millar","original_name":"Lee Millar","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Pluto (voice)","credit_id":"5f46ec4da2e6020034f15fff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Randolph","original_name":"Lillian Randolph","popularity":0.2472,"profile_path":"/k3dOsZunpup8wQcj1jKem9Oam8E.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mammy Two-Shoes (voice)","credit_id":"5f46ec6671f0950036840cd8","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64864,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Clyde Geronimi","original_name":"Clyde Geronimi","popularity":0.5443,"profile_path":"/eAeqN6fPYuzKjGRSaR2jqhSeeMq.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4796c3a368484e0cf0e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"560d3eb8925141478d00049e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226599,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Norman Ferguson","original_name":"Norman Ferguson","popularity":0.2345,"profile_path":"/fp0NPNlKl08kKbEgrlgvmxJJC7L.jpg","credit_id":"560d3ec6c3a368681f00880e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148152,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ed Love","original_name":"Ed Love","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"560d3ecfc3a3686819008e8c","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Earl Hurd","original_name":"Earl Hurd","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f46ec2ba2e6020034f15fc1","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0032886","wikidata_id":"Q3392771","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ksUX8s2FpPKHIv3OkXq0fV4xwZi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":980,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/il2ZKZMREOQqk0O5ypYnwh4KGPG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yS9b32aJpHfTcSY9c2UIjytEWJn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9jGhcimGrlkeugay6qcpgd8T7y0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/cy3rwk1me92ED02kHthUab8hXmz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6513,"name":"cartoon"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1940-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
