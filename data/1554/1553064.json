His inner monologue gives the whole film a certain course, and also \"gives credibility\" to the statements of artists, critics and officials of the time. In the documentary, almost all the prominent directors, screenwriters and critics of the post-war 50 years speak about artistic freedom and its restriction. We listen to Czesław Miłosz, Jerzy Stefan Stawiński, Janusz Morgenstern, Maria Kaniewska, Kazimierz Kutz, Janusz Głowacki, Feliks Falk, Wojciech Marczewski, Marek Piwowski, Janusz Kijowski, Wiesław Saniewski, Marek Ryszard Groński and Krzysztof Zanussi. There were also reviewers: Krzysztof Teodor Toeplitz and Zdzislaw Pietrasik.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wycinanki Pana N.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
