One misty October morning, they all got together to make a vast painting on one of the walls of a narrow road going through the district. A great day of community spirit. When the mural is finished, one can see the cranes and half demolished houses still there and a little further away the uninterrupted flow of traffic continues.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De Muur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan van der Keuken","original_name":"Johan van der Keuken","popularity":0.504,"profile_path":"/zPqpgZaXeXe02OFiiikL5kg58RP.jpg","credit_id":"68d8500d1173d3085838b76b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3693324,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bert Visser","original_name":"Bert Visser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d85067004e86a2a1e1c0da","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
