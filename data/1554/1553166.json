Swiecie 2009","overview":"Artur Zmijewski, a Polish artist born in 1966, explores social norms through films and photographs by creating unusual situations and documenting participants’ reactions. His work often addresses long-term trauma from historical and sociopolitical events, focusing on marginalized groups and popular beliefs. In “Sculpture Plein-air. Swiecie 2009,” Zmijewski organized workshops where Polish artists collaborated with steel workers in Swiecie to create public sculptures, inspired by 1960s collaborations in Elblag. This project questions the possibility of overcoming current social and political divides.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sculpture Plein-air.
