His facility was in urgent need of renovation. To raise funds, he decided to organize an \"urban survival\" event. Homeless people from the shelter were to show \"ordinary\" people what their lives were like. They were to be guides who show their \"charges\" how they struggle to survive on the city streets. The participants of the project had a chance to see what it's like to function in a big city without a roof over their heads, meeting human contempt at every turn.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welcome to Homelessness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1391430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henryk Dederko","original_name":"Henryk Dederko","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d91933358e0cdcdb5303b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6248222","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
