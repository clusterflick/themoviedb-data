Coupling my experiential research in the agency and my revitalization of their TV studio, this film is a very personal response to a treasure trove of historical material about waste in our current era of the climate crisis. It is not only the preservation of a long lost archive but a contemporary activation that is to be shared as a public artwork in this moment of ecological awareness. Adapting the aesthetics and recycling the materials of the sanitation department, Discard Records is a remixed historical film that is intended to spark new conversations that explore the intimate but often ignored relationship between the public and their waste.” - sTo Len, Director","popularity":0.15,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":100319,"logo_path":null,"name":"UnionDocs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Discard Records","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5715470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"sTo Len","original_name":"sTo Len","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/abIPbUrlEdJBXkV1IQSfd97SoiD.jpg","credit_id":"68d867512856ed088252ffc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":293261,"name":"waste disposal"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
