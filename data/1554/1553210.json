Do we exist because of our corporeal forms, or have we long existed in our ancestor’s dreams and prayers?  Api (April, 1949) is a one-take recorded translation of a man’s proposal letter and firm vision of life through love. Penned after my paternal grandfather’s time in a forced labor camp during WWII, Api (April, 1949) is a reconstruction of his bid for agency during a time of oppression and destruction. Both an homage to his dreams and prayers and a critical interpretation of values and authority, this film is an interpretation of generational inheritance and reclamation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fa2YCkYTG1CVZak4mp4xnmRP8mL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Api (April, 1949)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5663707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harper Stone","original_name":"Harper Stone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d80bcf12e2c833aeb997d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2234,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fa2YCkYTG1CVZak4mp4xnmRP8mL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1490}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
