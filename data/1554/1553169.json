Any film about this highly unconventional pianist owes it to itself to depart from the beaten path: on the borderline between documentary and fiction, this \"road movie\" is set against a backdrop of a winter journey by train across Poland with a piano installed on board. Punctuated by Piotr's highly personal reflections, the musical repertoire consists of essential pages by Bach, Chopin, Beethoven, Brahms, Schumann and Szymanowski.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/iuqpnGdxlOTthRrFKuKFojDljTB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Piotr Anderszewski - Voyageur intranquille","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2010247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piotr Anderszewski","original_name":"Piotr Anderszewski","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68d7fcc45f3b8a6c4638b5c3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Monsaingeon","original_name":"Bruno Monsaingeon","popularity":0.0756,"profile_path":"/upGuD3ifuTJJwNs0eBEYQyBQGgX.jpg","credit_id":"68d7fcbb5f3b8a6c4638b5c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1445089","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iuqpnGdxlOTthRrFKuKFojDljTB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
