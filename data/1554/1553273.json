It was here that the star locked himself away several times in the 1970s. Surrounded by Iggy Pop, Brian Eno, and producer Tony Visconti, Bowie spent his nights there crafting the strange, futuristic sounds of the album Low (1976), before being overtaken by his drug demons and fleeing to Berlin.\r Filmed in Hérouville and drawing on numerous archives, Christophe Conte and Gaëtan Chataigner's documentary gives a voice to the key players of the time, such as sound engineer Dominique Blanc-Francard, and brings this exceptional place back to life with filmed covers of Bowie's songs by Lou Doillon, Barbara Carlotti, and Mathieu Saïkaly.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ajZi7NQ2VHCmZRc83uhrAcerXrq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"David Bowie, l'homme cent visages ou le fantôme d'Hérouville","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ajZi7NQ2VHCmZRc83uhrAcerXrq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
