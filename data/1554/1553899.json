Inspired by childhood experiences, including women-only ceremonies and family Polaroid photos taken between the 1950s and 1970s, the film recreates a woman’s spiritual and ritual preparation. Weaving a dreamlike narrative, it blends the rituals of Kenya’s Indian heritage with the diversity of Kenyan cultures, reflected in a multicultural cast and intertwined ceremonies. Celebrating the sanctity of community, it creates a sacred space where women express themselves freely through rituals, song, and dance. Temple Road is both a tribute to the past and a call to recognize women as bearers of culture and tradition amidst increasing violence against them in Kenya.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"LE CHEMIN DU TEMPLE","title":"Temple Road","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
