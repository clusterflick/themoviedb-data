Day after day, he works overtime, which worries his best friend and business partner, Alana. She is concerned that Aeon is overworking himself, but he insists it's not a big deal. One day, Aeon's established routine is broken: he doesn't wake up in his bed, and it appears somebody else was in his apartment. It turns out he was sleepwalking. Struck by a brilliant idea, Aeon decides to \"employ\" his sleepwalking persona, pushing his efficiency to an even bigger limit. He shares his new strategy with Alana, who remains skeptical and more concerned than ever about his health. Yet the strategy proves to be successful, and the company begins to thrive. Through Aeon's dream, we witness his triumph at the cost of his well-being. After yet another grueling day of work he falls into a deep sleep, from which he can no longer wake up on his own.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"5:28 AM","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5714874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hank Moen Fisher","original_name":"Hank Moen Fisher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Aeon","credit_id":"68d8016657468290a62de151","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5714876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amelia Oliver","original_name":"Amelia Oliver","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Alana","credit_id":"68d801711e26b5fddce1b4b5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5714879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Montoya","original_name":"Gabriel Montoya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Investor","credit_id":"68d8019a8110eafaf02de1a0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5714880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Maragoto","original_name":"Eric Maragoto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Paramedic","credit_id":"68d801a71e26b5fddce1b4c2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5417244,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anton Sinitsyn","original_name":"Anton Sinitsyn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d801b5769d7ac1322ddfbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5417244,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anton Sinitsyn","original_name":"Anton Sinitsyn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d801c5cb55b90b23b40e57","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5714890,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Imanol Delgado Cadivich","original_name":"Imanol Delgado Cadivich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d802e45f3b8a6c4638b638","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5714891,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anton Sinitsyn","original_name":"Anton Sinitsyn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d802f290ecd009aab99734","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5714894,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ruslan Khismatullin","original_name":"Ruslan Khismatullin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d8032a9f5e490494c75bc0","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5417244,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anton Sinitsyn","original_name":"Anton Sinitsyn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d80334f1c834ba3038b6ac","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5417219,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Danylo Taran","original_name":"Danylo Taran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d80341e163580153e1b3a6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5714896,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Courtney Meena","original_name":"Courtney Meena","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d803510e484f2ea0b40dc2","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3311123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Britny Cloud","original_name":"Britny Cloud","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d8035ddfa796eac8bb00d4","department":"Art","job":"Set Decoration"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5417221,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Isabella Ferrara","original_name":"Isabella Ferrara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d8037034d53513a138b4c2","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5714897,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Brown","original_name":"Patrick Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d8037edfa796eac8bb00dd","department":"Directing","job":"Second Unit Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5714899,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jace Sears","original_name":"Jace Sears","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d8038b53f6f413a8c75b3b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37280176","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
