The insistent propaganda of the Nazi’s triumphs triggers the reaction of the Polish underground. In response to omnipresent expositions of German symbols of their ultimate victory, the Bureau of Information and Propaganda of the Union of Armed Struggle – the Home Army announces a competition to design an emblem-symbol of the Polish resistance movement and the fight with the invaders. The competition is carried out in spring 1942 with observance of all the rules of conspiracy and is won by Anna Smolenska, a member of the Girl Scout resistance movement. The sign of Fighting Poland, designed by her, becomes a symbol of the persistence of the Polish resistance against the Nazis.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fighting Poland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1044948,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Krzysztof Łukaszewicz","original_name":"Krzysztof Łukaszewicz","popularity":0.1067,"profile_path":"/8zzvAk3hr1of3Yv8KpWMu2RPbQQ.jpg","credit_id":"68d97c4492b6b3f9bebb0b99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
