Sorting coal in the Rydultowy Hard Coal Mine is a tough job, but the heroines are examples of fortitude. Unfortunately, their daily struggles are not limited to moving raw materials, but also concern the most mundane matters - such as fighting with mining officials over cleaning toilet cabins. Sometimes their only weapon turns out to be a sense of dignity and an equally important sense of humor.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1281999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Zmarz-Koczanowicz","original_name":"Maria Zmarz-Koczanowicz","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d96e26b7f786f4f0b41713","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8033646","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
