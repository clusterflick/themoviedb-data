In this type of feature film, the characters are usually young, beautiful, and rich, or at least hold two of these characteristics. The heroes of this film are the complete opposite. They are neither young, rich, nor beautiful. At times, however, they become beautiful. With the love that brightens their faces, reduces wrinkles, eradicates years and ailments. It brings joy. It calms anger and despair. Borzecka found her characters in the senior clubsâ€” places where older people, often alone, try to get out of the circle of isolation, have fun, and especially to love and be loved.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feminine - Masculine Issues","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1472054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ewa Borzecka","original_name":"Ewa Borzecka","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d7f9ffa0fcc7403ce1b30d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
