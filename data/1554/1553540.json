Femicides are not isolated incidents. They are part of a broader pattern of violence against women, often driven by deeply ingrained misogyny; as well as violence towards men.  All which are occurring more often than we might think.  Often the media reduces victims' stories to shocking headlines, disregarding the warning signs, and the failures within a society that allow such tragedies to persist.  We need to break the silence surrounding violence against women and men, and through this documentary, I hope to shed light not only on the past crimes of the Athens Ripper, but also on the issue of sexual assault that is occurring, right at our front door.","popularity":0.1857,"poster_path":"/6HuAhBLyWxd7S1qERBDA29nHtp5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
