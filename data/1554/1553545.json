This is how they ended up in Paris, where Gębski met the great Jacques Tati in 1977. In this documentary, Jozef Gębski turns into a film theorist and historian. He traces its evolution from the beginnings of cinema and the works of the Lumière brothers, through the New Wave revolution, to the 21st century 'third cinema' in which anyone can be a filmmaker. It also looks at what kind of cinema is 'born before our eyes'.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vive le cinématograph !","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1138191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Józef Gębski","original_name":"Józef Gębski","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68d91a2a8bbaf4344c38badf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5714818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agnieszka Gomulka","original_name":"Agnieszka Gomulka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d91a37d345f7d287bb06a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3110530","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
