Surrounded by natural yeasts - those invisible microorganisms naturally present on grape skins and in the environment that transform sugar into alcohol, she experiments, tastes, and transforms. As a foreigner, a woman, and an unconventional winemaker, she defies the norms of a traditionally male-dominated field and proves she belongs where no one expected her. Through living wine, she explores her freedom, her doubts, and gradually asserts her name, her style, and her place.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xOpJ710lo2YJye980fK8RN6Xu0b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2025-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Natural Yeasts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3059822,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Justine Saint-Lo","original_name":"Justine Saint-Lo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d92886dd8cdf84fa2de34a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/xOpJ710lo2YJye980fK8RN6Xu0b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Female Filmmakers Festival Berlin","release_date":"2025-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
