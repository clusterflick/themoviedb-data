Right now she still lives in a bird cage, at the mercy of the whims of a fate that transported her and her family from Myanmar to a refugee village in the Thai jungle. The rain drums ceaselessly on the roof. The torrential river in front of the house is as powerful as the suppressed feelings of a woman who gave birth to 12 children and lost some of them. She hasnâ€™t chosen her husband; moreover, he sometimes flies away. Now she only hopes that her daughter will follow.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When I Am a Bird","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1460687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monika Pawluczuk","original_name":"Monika Pawluczuk","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d9249512e2c833aeb99dac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3438458","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
