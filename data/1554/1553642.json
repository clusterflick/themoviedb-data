After Luke storms out, Jack plays guitar until the music builds and his ears bleed. The next day, Sam learns of Jack’s death and tells her sister Deana. They drive to the scene in a white vintage Mustang, their version of the 1967 Impala “Baby.” Undercover as FBI agents, they interview Jack’s sister Jasmine and check EMF. Sam hits the lore and discovers a vengeful spirit. Luke’s bandmate Luz gets attacked. Deana figures out that the spirit is attached to something through its energy. The ghost is in the music! Deana gets possessed and knocks out Sam. When Sam comes to and tries to free her, Deana touches a guitar pick and the spirit transfers into it. The pick flies toward Luke before Deana stomps it. Together the Winchesters burn the pick, laying the spirit to rest. The episode closes with Sam and Deana sharing a melodrama moment and hugging as “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door” plays.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":"/oSK45ridVcuWiXXHypTugloHS5n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Supernatural
