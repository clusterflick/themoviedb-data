For 40 years, dozens of priests have gathered in a confidential support group to talk about their homosexuality. Now, they want to spark change and gain recognition. For the first time, they have opened their doors to a camera. The journey of these priests crystallizes all the upheavals shaking the Catholic Church: the representation and acceptance of homosexuality, priestly celibacy and chastity, and the hypocrisy of the institution.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fw7XLWDKISnTG46u2o2OhzkSSGi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Des prêtres gays brisent le silence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5716572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrien Giraud","original_name":"Adrien Giraud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d96a04a5a067bc255307ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5716573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathan Lautier","original_name":"Nathan Lautier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d96a10f1d56d0f7db4148c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5716572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrien Giraud","original_name":"Adrien Giraud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d96a419bef492725e1c807","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5716573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathan Lautier","original_name":"Nathan Lautier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d96a4f93612836f6e1c4ec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1843264,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anne-Charlotte Gourraud","original_name":"Anne-Charlotte Gourraud","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68d96a5a64cc5017ecb413fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/fw7XLWDKISnTG46u2o2OhzkSSGi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
