Whether celebrated or reviled, Kissinger’s contradictions reflect those at the heart of America’s foreign policy during the second half of the 20th century, a period in which America became the unchallenged superpower in the world yet often pursued policy at odds with its own highest ideals.By examining his life up to and throughout his tortured relationship with President Richard Nixon, Kissinger endeavors to understand precisely what drove his relentless drive for power. It is a story of deep contradictions — of Kissinger’s obsession with securing American supremacy, staving off nuclear war, and checking the power of our enemies, even while consorting with dictators and tolerating widespread violation of human rights.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":92479,"logo_path":"/xBlCFYbQb8H4ZpIMLco53ybin9L.png","name":"American Experience Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Kissinger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":533195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Kissinger","original_name":"Henry Kissinger","popularity":0.142,"profile_path":"/91UzhTU4tZUFNloNdn0lakKFdbH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68d9aaeb8110eafaf02dea50","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barak Goodman","original_name":"Barak Goodman","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":"/muxIsmjnvZSjRQBDzLouSUDWb4B.jpg","credit_id":"68d9ac24132102f2b1c76320","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9376,"name":"richard nixon"},{"id":280575,"name":"henry kissinger"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
