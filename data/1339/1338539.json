A film that departs from the stories of two images and that moves on crossing them with the ones that come out of the construction of his latest book. A film that shows how the deep Portuguese look of this photographer has seen the transformations of his country and of the world in the last 60 years. A look that has imagined what the photographer has seen and shot: the kiss of Maria to Salazar’s dead body in 1970, the kidnapping of the Israeli during the 1972 Olympic Games, the turning-point in the 74 revolution and the seductive revelations of the portraits from 1995.","popularity":0.0646,"poster_path":"/o2iCas7B09OhHpqaWJNe6bUuHHR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18709,"logo_path":"/MSxQqmbEWh48b4DIrpoc0R1jqA.png","name":"Persona Non Grata
