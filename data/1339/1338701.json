A splendid loser who'd like to be a gangster, just like in the movies. Angie. A young woman who desperately tries to be normal. When he finds himself dragged into a life-threatening plot, she's the one who'll get to save him. Together, they'll forge their best creation: the Baron.  Just like them, a no-budget film which passionately dreams to be like a true film noir, with its plot as clear as mud, crossed by hints of fantasy and absurd, under the influence of Boris Vian and Dashiell Hammett.","popularity":0.0777,"poster_path":"/fTVCPNKizpV7GifsLwEQdJ7O2ge.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tales
