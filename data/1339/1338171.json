The film follows the footsteps of an artist who embarks on a solitary expedition into the island's hinterlands. During an extraordinary night, this journey leads to a magical encounter with a deity from Tahitian mythology. This pivotal moment sparks a profound contemplation, birthing a story that blurs the lines between the human and the divine, challenging our perception of reality and spirituality.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dawn of Creation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"L'éveil à la Création","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlo De Togni","original_name":"Carlo De Togni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c916227409106764876dfb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4901305,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elena Sparacino","original_name":"Elena Sparacino","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c9162eb7e2cb383ed81134","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Portland Festival of Cinema, Animation & Technology","release_date":"2024-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
