This film shines a light on a subject much more in need of attention than football: The glaring inequity highlighted by a state-of-the-art venue across from a historic neighborhood whose demise we've allowed for decades.

This film explores the culture that saw fit to invest hundreds of millions of public dollars in a sports venue while neglecting the community just across the street.","popularity":1.6687,"poster_path":"/dl7fkoOF4Peo8TeWt2gEFb3CFoQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Home Team","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13314126","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1650,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dl7fkoOF4Peo8TeWt2gEFb3CFoQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1100}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
