Upon receiving an invitation to her wedding mere months later, Ewan returns home for the wedding, bearing the decision of winning her back or letting her go, only to have a sixteen year old Lolita, Amy Collins thrust into his path. Amy has her own heartbreak to cope with, and the two, turning a blind eye under intense scrutinisation, become unlikely allies in their search for some ease and some answers.","popularity":0.3617,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":237214,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rocket Chicken International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life is your oyster.
