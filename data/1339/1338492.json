Bing in no way intends to comply with that demand, imagining this cousin to be some tawdry peasant girl. By chance, he meets a young, beautiful woman with whom he becomes deeply smitten and whose heart he sets his sights on winning. What Bing does not yet know is that the young woman is a friend of his business partner’s wife – and is in fact none other than Ingeborg Nielsen.
