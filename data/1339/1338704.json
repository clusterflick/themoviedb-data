Van Gogh is not only one of the most beloved artists of all time, but perhaps the most misunderstood. This film is a chance to reexamine and better understand this iconic artist. Focusing on his unique creative process, Van Gogh: Poets & Lovers explores the artist’s years in the south of France, where he revolutionised his style. Van Gogh became consumed with a passion for storytelling in his art, turning the world around him into vibrant, idealised spaces and symbolic characters.","popularity":0.3204,"poster_path":"/iFtSnlwTcLSCmpdKWpz3W621I6e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seventh Art Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Van Gogh: Poets & Lovers","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Exhibition on Screen: Van Gogh – Poets & Lovers","type":"complete title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1294711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie de Courcey","original_name":"Jamie de Courcey","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Vincent van Gogh","credit_id":"67d4f676411f90fecdf152fa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1046702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bickerstaff","original_name":"David Bickerstaff","popularity":0.1159,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cae5265125aa99b8d84011","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Grabsky","original_name":"Phil Grabsky","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cae53499cbd093ba879c09","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33265363","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xV6S5UkSGc5t5jHZIXpcVUFuchO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iFtSnlwTcLSCmpdKWpz3W621I6e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"VAN GOGH: POETS & LOVERS | OFFICIAL TRAILER | EXHIBITION ON SCREEN","key":"bm9xTFO2LOI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2024-08-06T08:33:59.000Z","id":"66caeb817dd54f18f6749907"}]}}}
