Or so she thinks. Her boyfriend, Nathan, is too busy playing house with his twin sister, Claire, to notice. The twins have lived as near-shut-ins in their expansive, messy loft sustained by a large inheritance. They fill their jobless hours building elaborate pillow forts, watching home videos, and teaching themselves dirty jokes in Russian.
