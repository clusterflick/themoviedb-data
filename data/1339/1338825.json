Her drug-fueled visions reveal two things: that a) Ed fell for his ex-boyfriend Joseph when he heard the \"perfect playlist\" Joseph played on their first date, and b) that said ex-boyfriend did not, in fact, make said playlist. Instantly reinvigorated, Ed launches a search for the true author of the playlist, and the soul mate that awaits him.","popularity":0.306,"poster_path":"/or5RkLKZXqgNVbFGoqp3zMCfTeu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"King Ed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1700686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brendan Scannell","original_name":"Brendan Scannell","popularity":0.2501,"profile_path":"/imI1WwpMwFki7A4EeSxhidGRtEG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66cb6274725d1d8491205a09","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1181331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sufe Bradshaw","original_name":"Sufe Bradshaw","popularity":0.2495,"profile_path":"/5jfG8O8EKOv2171laVM7A6VCdVW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66cb627dd7bc5bb63148b31e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1946760,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nick Fascitelli","original_name":"Nick Fascitelli","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66cb6284297ca006f11039cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Plotnick","original_name":"Jack Plotnick","popularity":0.4803,"profile_path":"/1BeShuLhc2HXZieyGEOVgDssAuR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66cb6293e90f4e487f6e9d43","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1530928,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nancy Cohen","original_name":"Nancy Cohen","popularity":0.0926,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66cb62c88f2b8bf61e1d5f4e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2288278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Frizzell","original_name":"Nathan Frizzell","popularity":0.0556,"profile_path":"/yDcERB0jnPZMfcR46hBHNcbXNdK.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66cb62cf9c1ffe84fab33cbf","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1946760,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nick Fascitelli","original_name":"Nick Fascitelli","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cb625897e355798d0d43c7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1946760,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nick Fascitelli","original_name":"Nick Fascitelli","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cb6250b1871bf2d80f8cfe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32879760","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/or5RkLKZXqgNVbFGoqp3zMCfTeu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
