But times soon take a turn for the worse; the only source of income for the local community is the fish factory where he works, and when it faces closure, the workers and his best friend look for a way out. But unlike most young people on the island, Kári wants to stay, at peace with things as they are. Even when everyone is chasing a better future somewhere else, Kári decides to stay and face the challenges head-on. Because for him, his home town is The Last Paradise on Earth.","popularity":0.2564,"poster_path":"/ocRsZXImwMbuai1a1qqmMzR5ojK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64935,"logo_path":"/9TR3JrU9t78JJlPX837LzWRAApf.png","name":"Adomeit Film","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":168217,"logo_path":"/nU6DF3Id1SoZpURX0E8rNmxZbcM.png","name":"Kykmyndir","origin_country":"FO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"FO","name":"Faeroe Islands"}],"release_date":"2025-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Faroese","iso_639_1":"fo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Paradise on Earth","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sámal H.
