In the centrally located Affan neighbourhood in the city of Antakya on the border of Turkey and Syria, where the earthquakes have had devastating effects, Erkan stands amidst the rubble with his close relatives and surveys the damage. On one side is his father, who left the neighbourhood to study in London in the 1970s and has returned only for brief visits ever-since. On the other side is his aunt, who never left Affan even after her home was destroyed. Passing through the same streets on different days with either his father or aunt by his side, Erkan invites the audience to witness the stories of his family and their neighbours and learn about their experiences since the earthquakes.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/gBj8X6vNnoVEWs3XmigqruPNGxk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":245622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terso Cinema & Production","origin_country":"TR"},{"id":245623,"logo_path":null,"name":"Heim Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No.910","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4904422,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erkan Gürsel","original_name":"Erkan Gürsel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cbb0d799c57e9209749b14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4083187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Umur Dağlı","original_name":"Umur Dağlı","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6743cf83aab722bfa7c92dd3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5080333,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gök Akyel","original_name":"Gök Akyel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6743cf8a4d50ccd7da48c3db","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5080334,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philip Gamble","original_name":"Philip Gamble","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6743cf924d50ccd7da48c3e7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"no910film","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5arkEb5SrCtxaXrPoRobMfCRtuI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/83oLY9bqJNlQzCTjdspwLGuvXzp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gBj8X6vNnoVEWs3XmigqruPNGxk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"NO.910","key":"t3Y5kYZwX-k","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-11-07T14:30:42.000Z","id":"6743cf4f80b44a8937b7927f"}]}}}
