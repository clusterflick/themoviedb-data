This collage-like narrative, which flirts with both the everyday and the magical, unfolds as a mythical reverie on signs and language — spoken, written and visual. The Nysts' fascination with objects and their representations is exquisitely illustrated; their verbal and textual intricacies show a delight with language and its semiotic relation to images. Creating a poetic meta-language that suggests the immensity and abstraction of ideas, the Nysts construct a fantastical video universe where \"information is a tragedy,\" and a unicorn signifies salvation.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"J'ai la tête qui tourne","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3582281,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Louis Nyst","original_name":"Jacques Louis Nyst","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c8e43b5e61f34f9f5ed593","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4901053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danièle Nyst","original_name":"Danièle Nyst","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c8e41fbfe4d06fb7b10177","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
