The work features a portrait of his father’s mother, Clorine Morthem, Dhungatti people, at the centre.  In this documentary, Blak Douglas shares his experiences of tracing his grandmother’s story. Beginning with old family photographs, he follows his grandmother’s life back to the Cootamundra Girls Home, where she became a Ward of the State, stripped of her name, language, family and culture and forced into servitude. At the NSW State Archives, he unearths the harrowing machinations of a system that deliberately fragmented his family.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/28ZJH5tAltJqFaCFEKz7WlcBITO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":237107,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diorama Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2023-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blak Douglas vs The Commonwealth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4901119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blak Douglas","original_name":"Blak Douglas","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66c8fb22835326732a5ed814","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4901095,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rowan du Boisee","original_name":"Rowan du Boisee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c8f740db0f5d6ed4b101ab","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4901092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelica Cristina Dio","original_name":"Angelica Cristina Dio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c8f7569a61583f951d4617","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4901095,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rowan du Boisee","original_name":"Rowan du Boisee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c8f7c679fe141e0eea9d4d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4901120,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Blak Douglas","original_name":"Blak Douglas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c8fb4894da6dc4ea8f1497","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4901092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelica Cristina Dio","original_name":"Angelica Cristina Dio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c8f6f0cb075ed68115ada9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4901097,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Declan Kelly","original_name":"Declan Kelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c8f77853e25821f0f2bca2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4901092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelica Cristina Dio","original_name":"Angelica Cristina Dio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c8f7ae5957f4c3722720cb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32509907","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":2788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/28ZJH5tAltJqFaCFEKz7WlcBITO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2023-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
