The narrator is Emily Harris, aka Yolanda, a member of the radical left-wing group the Symbionese Liberation Army. On June 8, 1974 — shortly after most members of the Symbionese Liberation Army burned to death in a Los Angeles house after a firefight with police — Harris recorded this communication to the people. Although the radicalism of the SLA has largely vanished, it has left ghostly traces on the landscape and people of California. “Yolanda” embraces structure and stillness to create the unsettled feeling of buried cultural memories stirring to life.","popularity":0.1058,"poster_path":"/aSPE1cv7QRahsBVvpYCAB1TpGEI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yolanda","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212135,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"John Brian King","original_name":"John Brian King","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6779b1956d7ca00e787298e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1282,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aSPE1cv7QRahsBVvpYCAB1TpGEI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":855}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
