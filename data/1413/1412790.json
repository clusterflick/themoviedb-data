It’s a city cut in two by the Philadelphia Road, a security corridor between Sinai and Gaza. It’s destiny changed during the night of 12 September 2005, when the Israeli army withdrew from the Gaza Strip. The Israelis evacuated the Philadelphia Road and the colonies surrounding the city disappeared. But Rafah would never emerge from its chaos. Rafah is the hub of arms trafficking between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. Since the Israeli withdrawal, these arms have contributed to the bloody wars between families. After the Hamas victory at the legislative elections, the city sank into a major economic crisis. On 25 June, 2006, Israeli corporal Gilad Shalit was abducted by Palestinian militants using a tunnel dug from Rafah. In reprisal, Tsahal shelled the houses of arms dealers located along the Philadelphia Road. By 12 September, 2006, a year after the withdrawal, all hopes of rebirth had died.","popularity":0.1884,"poster_path":"/79mb4jcmvdITyxq1CG7WFZWobis.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249265,"logo_path":null,"name":"Play Prod","origin_country":""},{"id":43507,"logo_path":null,"name":"System TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rafah - Chronicles of a city in the Gaza Strip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2277260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Marchetti","original_name":"Stéphane Marchetti","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/aWkLxFByvgrbnvzlfuaz3qtNzys.jpg","credit_id":"677a9b2455d4b38f9366ee5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5160233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexis Monchovet","original_name":"Alexis Monchovet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677a9b30f6bc9716e87271e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5160235,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sébastien Mesquida","original_name":"Sébastien Mesquida","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677a9b47f6bc9716e87271ec","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2277260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Marchetti","original_name":"Stéphane Marchetti","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/aWkLxFByvgrbnvzlfuaz3qtNzys.jpg","credit_id":"677a9b59816b2810d166eccf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5160233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexis Monchovet","original_name":"Alexis Monchovet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677a9b65a6def0111a749cac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5160233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexis Monchovet","original_name":"Alexis Monchovet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677a9bc055d4b38f9366ee7c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5160233,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexis Monchovet","original_name":"Alexis Monchovet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677a9bd74bf0f0e3b474a1dd","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2277260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stéphane Marchetti","original_name":"Stéphane Marchetti","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/aWkLxFByvgrbnvzlfuaz3qtNzys.jpg","credit_id":"677a9be455d4b38f9366ee89","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5103292,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Damien Traversaz","original_name":"Damien Traversaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677a9c4915521f83d966f12b","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1415,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/79mb4jcmvdITyxq1CG7WFZWobis.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9454,"name":"frontier"},{"id":275377,"name":"gaza"},{"id":344706,"name":"arab-israeli conflict"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
