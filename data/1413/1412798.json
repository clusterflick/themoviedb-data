Pioneers also help elders. Papa Gigia understands the importance of the process, but he does not want to cut a vineyard on his homestead because of the memories of his youth. His grandson, Dato, who doesn't want to lag behind his comrades, starts pruning the vineyard arbitrarily, for which Papa severely punishes him. But when Dato's behavior becomes the object of criticism by the pioneers, Papa forgives his grandson and cuts the remaining vine himself.","popularity":0.1467,"poster_path":"/leaXWClUpr1gkSWzCpqlwXHHWfC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113190,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Georgia Film Academy","origin_country":""},{"id":186508,"logo_path":"/dONUQvMFW5X8DCw6nX9Dk26TQwF.png","name":"Georgia-Film","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"1960-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"პაპა გიგია","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","title":"პაპა გიგია","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kote Daushvili","original_name":"კოტე დაუშვილი","popularity":0.0966,"profile_path":"/ykgyy0HpIlnpiPai8QBojDYSfzm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"gigia","credit_id":"677affdb25e0e91c5774f6cc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5151152,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tamara Dolidze","original_name":"Tamara Dolidze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"ciala","credit_id":"677afffc25e0e91c5774f6d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julieta Vashakmadze","original_name":"Julieta Vashakmadze","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/bNM4ElHaaDFH618s0n5JC7Wv0mV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"tina","credit_id":"677b000e830a8f4cc766b9ff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5160923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"iamze gvatua","original_name":"iamze gvatua","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"natia","credit_id":"677b0046816b2810d166fe88","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2293661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soso Abramashvili","original_name":"Soso Abramashvili","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"chabuka","credit_id":"677b005aa6def0111a74aa1a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1565683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandre Jorjoliani","original_name":"Aleksandre Jorjoliani","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/tBDQMgyWqpveZhtTbOe3I596CMS.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"ilo","credit_id":"677b006ba6def0111a74aa23","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1306526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Megi Tsulukidze","original_name":"Megi Tsulukidze","popularity":0.0595,"profile_path":"/fzdSYi6WolgZXhziuuOj8dqwPaV.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"teacher","credit_id":"677b008538d26a2a6372c3f9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1309946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Imedo Kakhiani","original_name":"იმედა კახიანი","popularity":0.1469,"profile_path":"/9TaK4C6vvkQi6MgotUmtob04c7N.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"677b00a2830a8f4cc766ba3b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2291302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zura Laferadze","original_name":"Zura Laferadze","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"677b00b1a6def0111a74aa3e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":560143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ipolite Khvichia","original_name":"იპოლიტე ხვიჩია","popularity":0.1429,"profile_path":"/zRoTr4ZgYN8IyRkHSJKcB5MUjZK.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"677b00ba38d26a2a6372c424","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5160931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"caca amirejibi","original_name":"caca amirejibi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"677b00d438d26a2a6372c440","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4421482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamaz Bibiluri","original_name":"Tamaz Bibiluri","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"677b00e325e0e91c5774f728","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1721724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.
