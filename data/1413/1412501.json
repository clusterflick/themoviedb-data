A prince leaves his country on a boat in search of adventure, only to find himself plunged into a series of unlikely adventures involving everything from a magical bronze horse that transports our hero to a faraway land, to a gigantic monster holding a beautiful princess captive. The forces of lust and death are forever intertwined, leading the prince to his inevitable downfall.","popularity":0.0822,"poster_path":"/kyWWIf9vcVCNXmVQMIvMx0HhkkP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160192,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paris Plage Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":11332,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept-Arte","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Histoire d'un prince devenu borgne et mendiant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agathe Chouchan","original_name":"Agathe Chouchan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/zLr2uGFiXI7TMiYDSiQbbv3DIhl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6779ae2b25e0e91c5774d52c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1078785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florence Miailhe","original_name":"Florence Miailhe","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/gb54ryCnDfTNuZOXWc0JZv1L19h.jpg","credit_id":"6779ad9b816b2810d166c701","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5159150,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marie Desplin","original_name":"Marie Desplin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6779ada8816b2810d166c710","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5159152,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Catherine Chouchan","original_name":"Catherine Chouchan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6779ae4d5ac1bd826166c8be","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1747634,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Emmanuelle Labbé","original_name":"Emmanuelle Labbé","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6779ae5c82cce15a7674dcc3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4519234,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Denis Colina","original_name":"Denis Colina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6779ae6c816b2810d166c74d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0454163","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/kyWWIf9vcVCNXmVQMIvMx0HhkkP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
