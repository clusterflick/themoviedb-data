Based on Cervantes’ 17th-century story, the ballet recounts the adventures of the titular dreamer and his neighbour Sancho Panza as they ride across the Spanish countryside. When they encounter two lovers - Kitri and Basilio – Don Quixote is determined to help keep them together, and after battling windmills and crossing paths with Cupid, Dulcinea and the Queen of the Dryads, it’s he who delivers the happy dénouement. The shimmering costumes and colourful sets sublimate a vivacious and delightfully entertaining work.","popularity":0.3825,"poster_path":"/97hu5X5xU5QmRQr062FGu8XWCRl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":144,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Quixote","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Opéra National De Paris: Don Quixote","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1827488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sae Eun Park","original_name":"Sae Eun Park","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/f44qVg5znptkEYCjQ36PBxuLXXw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kitri","credit_id":"6778a4e18fd6f5109d7269bb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5157664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Marque","original_name":"Paul Marque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Basillio","credit_id":"6778a51615521f83d966b8b6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5157666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florent Melac","original_name":"Florent Melac","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Espada","credit_id":"6778a53025e0e91c5774b5c0","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Nureyev","original_name":"Rudolf Nureyev","popularity":0.3107,"profile_path":"/5bukL5Fsj1SBCdCtzfpWaUBuftu.jpg","credit_id":"6778a572eca85bd508723d8c","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yNRWcvtwltnfzRuJpC0yJWOwdsO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1820},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2LBmSKeUjQBiGyyO8kQw9F5Ka13.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1820},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mOY2vU0INYg6inKzf2sNKb9TkU9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1820}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1140,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/97hu5X5xU5QmRQr062FGu8XWCRl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":760}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":10551,"name":"ballet"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
