What begins as a simple, heartfelt mission quickly spirals into a clash with corporate greed when a shady investor takes an interest in her idea. With her teacher by her side, Andy must face the manipulative world of business, where her age, gender, and innocence are weaponized against her.  This is a satire about the exploitation of pure intentions in a profit-driven world, told with humor, heart, and a sharp critique of power dynamics.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/9N5Yd6mg8mTQ7GYCaNGTlfdGTm4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249327,"logo_path":null,"name":"threesixty Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":249328,"logo_path":null,"name":"Renaissance Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Rumored","tagline":"When compassion gets cornered, who really wins?","title":"DOGS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"DOG HOUSE","type":"Old title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5161039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Morgan","original_name":"Katherine Morgan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Andy Caroline","credit_id":"677b193215521f83d9670304","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5161040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cody Shockey","original_name":"Cody Shockey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Clark Henderson","credit_id":"677b193cc5070b8a4666829a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5161041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabella Segura","original_name":"Isabella Segura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Dunbar","credit_id":"677b194a25e0e91c5774f99b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5161043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jazlene Bibbs","original_name":"Jazlene Bibbs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Faceless","credit_id":"677b19a955d4b38f93670428","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5161040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cody Shockey","original_name":"Cody Shockey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677b4f39ec51791dfe6676d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5161041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabella Segura","original_name":"Isabella Segura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677b4f5015521f83d96707be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5161040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cody Shockey","original_name":"Cody Shockey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677b4f6215521f83d96707cc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5161040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cody Shockey","original_name":"Cody Shockey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677b4f6eeca85bd508728cc0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5161040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cody Shockey","original_name":"Cody Shockey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677b4f88d9b0e70d5d723fbc","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5161040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cody Shockey","original_name":"Cody Shockey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677b4fc54bf0f0e3b474c087","department":"Art","job":"Creative Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":853,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fMuC66aGHy7t5bHOZB46NLaTbx2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1517},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1075,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uePoiOb3vVehuHGqgZrjMyAXYkg.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1912},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bVpZv4svwyTbYVzpi2DZmhUMIiE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1917}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1484,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9N5Yd6mg8mTQ7GYCaNGTlfdGTm4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":989},{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":1551,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xhgK5Y5fDbY3gfwIQe9Mub3CfE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1120}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
