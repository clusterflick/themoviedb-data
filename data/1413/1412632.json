Your journey takes you along watery natural paths-from wintery alpine lakes and roaring waterfalls in Yosemite National Park to geysers and bubbling pots in Yellowstone. Relax in lush spring meadows, blanketed with colorful flowers.  Glide downstream through precipitous granite river canyons that open into spacious desert sunsets in the Grand Canyon. Elk, moose, chipmunks, and birds add their own rhapsody of harmonious rhythms along the way.
