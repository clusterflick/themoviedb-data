The film is a composite of satirical performances, music and poetry especially composed for the film, which transform the Israeli national anthem and the Declaration of Independence into inclusive rallying calls. These elements are interspersed with unique archival material, compelling situations, revealing statements by a variety of people, all related to the ongoing conflict and the occupation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3j2oo2Pps6srPX42JuPvryJ5Dcl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2009-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Geographically close, politically distant: Israel-Palestine in nine chapters","title":"State of Suspension","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3537902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mieke Bal","original_name":"Mieke Bal","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62743523a93d251697ebf164","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2280059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benny Brunner","original_name":"Benny Brunner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6274352d29c62639cc9e3b18","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3j2oo2Pps6srPX42JuPvryJ5Dcl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"State of Suspension - Short Excerpt","key":"CkfeCr_Jmuo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-05-07T15:18:52.000Z","id":"62743578a313b82f757ff5b1"}]}}}
