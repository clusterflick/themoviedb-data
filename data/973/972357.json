Bill Brand frames the action and its trace, in the process, linking painting and cinema. Swan's Island explores gesture in painting, and how it relates to the hand held camera. The film creates abstractions from the glistening blue paint that in turn evoke a seascape or a distant, yet intimate place.  In its choreography, Swan's Island is a duet. The painted figure occupies space, and the camera describes that space. The person filming and the person filmed are moving as one, and yet they are separate, each an island. Seeing and being seen are inextricably bound with emotions of love and loss, longing and a sense of place.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/eN0VEIPvx0pzMPTOUOsKbQ0KZTd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swan’s Island","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katy Martin","original_name":"Katy Martin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6274d73bb6cff1168e414f06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2191503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Brand","original_name":"Bill Brand","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/v8PHkZsZG24XJUZWQCv7RMecuP8.jpg","credit_id":"6274d72e51c01f0066eb53ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1854340","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eN0VEIPvx0pzMPTOUOsKbQ0KZTd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
