Split decision is a boxing term used when the judges divide their votes in finding a winner. In this case the fight is between the two heroes of the film who are seen intermittently in a bar, negotiating a pick-up, and at home, breaking up in a domestic quarrel. The fight is also in the telling, between modes of conventional representation and modes of radical representation - between conventional continuity editing, and abstraction created through computer generated grids. The film features an appearance by Carolee Schneemann and digital imaging from before the era of personal computers.","popularity":0.2781,"poster_path":"/jBBVGAZ9t718XXf5L15tyWSnur9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32040,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York State Council on the
