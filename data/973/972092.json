They live alone, but her mother's grave is in the little clearing and the father has promised never to leave it. To them comes McDaniels, the logging boss, who is attracted by Jean and offers her father to discard his Indian wife for the young girl. Romaine indignantly refuses and is threatened with dismissal. Gene, knowing he cannot bear to leave his wife's grave, assents to the marriage in spite of her father's protests. Stanton, chief owner of the lumber company, maroons his worthless son in the woods, in the hope of reforming him. Gene takes care of him when he sprains his ankle, and he protects her from McDaniels and is blamed for the murder of the boss when his vengeful Indian wife stabs him in the back.","popularity":0.2058,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":38293,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Woman of Redemption","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Elvidge","original_name":"June Elvidge","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/fbcSD4gt790qR0CBpsqqL4EkqfP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gene Romaine","credit_id":"62740fdf78570e0066210835","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1419563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Martin","original_name":"Charles Martin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rSsIggGQCATJFGOP1LmBXhk7gFK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jacques Romaine","credit_id":"62740febc0442918dff1e64b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bowers","original_name":"John Bowers","popularity":0.0933,"profile_path":"/j6KhoMBcaddOHhyuHjXIUxAyjzP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tim Stanton","credit_id":"62740ff851c01f0050980b7e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Hart","original_name":"Al Hart","popularity":0.0484,"profile_path":"/6dXQecaZvvO0OuseiFqX8bnhUia.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Boss McDaniels","credit_id":"62741003a3e4ba006798981c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Shannon","original_name":"Alex Shannon","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Timothy Stanton Sr.","credit_id":"62740ffeb6cff1168fcf3cb4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2063953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Pagano","original_name":"Marie Pagano","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Squaw","credit_id":"62741062a313b82f757f57af","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Travers Vale","original_name":"Travers Vale","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6274100da93d251697eb6341","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1601288,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Virginia Tyler Hudson","original_name":"Virginia Tyler Hudson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62741015c0442918de992571","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1592472,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Doty Hobart","original_name":"Doty Hobart","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6274101e06f98400a94ad6df","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0190153","wikidata_id":"Q53809233","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1918-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
