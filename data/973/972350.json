The “Susie” in the title refers to a sibling but the \"ghost\" refers more generally to lingering feelings of loss. The cinematography and performance both express a tentative presence and diffuse sense of disappearance. Is she looking for something? Is she really there? We shot with aging 16mm film in my downtown Manhattan neighborhood, just before construction mania obliterated the last traces of the manufacturing district I’d moved into years earlier.","popularity":0.0631,"poster_path":"/2qWBMSNzvGYab317a8U3ieWOav8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Susie's Ghost","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3538390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruthie Marantz","original_name":"Ruthie Marantz","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"6274d07578570e2e5e78699a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2191503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Brand","original_name":"Bill Brand","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/v8PHkZsZG24XJUZWQCv7RMecuP8.jpg","credit_id":"6274d0895800c479b7984b8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3538390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruthie Marantz","original_name":"Ruthie Marantz","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6274d52ca313b82f747222ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2033393","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2qWBMSNzvGYab317a8U3ieWOav8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
