Unwilling to be found yet at the same time yearning to reach out, the enigmatic story of his proximity to a root plant is told through the few unaddressed letters he decides to send out. The film captures moments from Daniel Jacobyâ€™s journey through the Northernmost island of Japan in search of this secluded man. Images of unrelated landscapes, situations and objects that the artist encounters in the way acquire an otherworldly aura when presented in the context of the potato-man.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qHoZXtFuZOJqW3AMqw4S7C6WJU4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2016-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jagata","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mamoru Okuno","original_name":"Mamoru Okuno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jagata","credit_id":"672ca627be76b0644b3dd7b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryochi Ichinose","original_name":"Ryochi Ichinose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Fox","credit_id":"672ca63e898d18e69095f815","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Jacoby","original_name":"Daniel Jacoby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ikEbOkGHVsm4dNsQXrwkI3DyFNQ.jpg","credit_id":"66e94eccb2917eb1800abd28","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Jacoby","original_name":"Daniel Jacoby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ikEbOkGHVsm4dNsQXrwkI3DyFNQ.jpg","credit_id":"66e94edd5168a896e11ea298","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Jacoby","original_name":"Daniel Jacoby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ikEbOkGHVsm4dNsQXrwkI3DyFNQ.jpg","credit_id":"66e94ee85168a896e11ea29d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682674,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Liisa Hirsch","original_name":"Liisa Hirsch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e94f055c0519a234d2c638","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7402416","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3KKPJXGsbzkCyMgx2tJ6nD7wk2D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qcvO89bxvNl1ACYXtMOsZxrVsZq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qHoZXtFuZOJqW3AMqw4S7C6WJU4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jagata | 2016 | CLIP","key":"160476790","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-03-26T21:55:51.000Z","id":"66e94f5e5c0519a234d2c671"}]}}}
