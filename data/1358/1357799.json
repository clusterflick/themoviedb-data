How can a piece of wood become \"the love of my life\", as Frank Peter Zimmermann calls his 1711 Stradivarius \"Lady Inchiquin\"? The instrument, worth 6 million Euros, was locked away in a safe for more than two years - due to bankruptcy of its lender, a German bank. This documentary follows the world renowned violinist as he reunites with his beloved violin. Zimmermann's story is intertwined with another master's search for perfection. We look behind the scenes and witness the creation of a contemporary violin by the \"21st Century Stradivari\", Martin Schleske.","popularity":0.0761,"poster_path":"/awbRMD2SsGI5eTEocMZNxQEs0Sw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Seele der Geige","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8682622","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/awbRMD2SsGI5eTEocMZNxQEs0Sw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
