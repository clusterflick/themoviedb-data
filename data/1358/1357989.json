Charlotte Roy, a young woman who lost a loved one in a work accident, meets Doctor Dufour to make an appointment to receive this treatment, 24 hours later. She hides it as best she can from her loved ones, who are beginning to worry about her. Between the suspicions of her friend Sarah, the insistence of her mother and her own doubts, Charlotte navigates through these final hours which, she hopes, will be the last of a long year of suffering.","popularity":0.3662,"poster_path":"/ryad66BH7nNTI3JnOdayr5uBuIY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A
