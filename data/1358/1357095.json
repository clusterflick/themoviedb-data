Mohasses' anti-shah and anti-Islamic Republic cartoons used settings and costumes of the Qajar dynasty of 1794 to 1925, a misdirection that fooled nobody. The film features commentary from Iranian intellectuals of the time including Houshang Taheri, Javad Mojabi, and Fereidoun Gilani whereas Mohasses, a man of few words, is noticeably mute throughout.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ardeshir Mohasses & His Caricatures","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4569430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ardeshir Mohasses","original_name":"Ardeshir Mohasses","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"66e73b32d7bcca524db0bfbb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1658099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bahman Maghsoudlou","original_name":"Bahman Maghsoudlou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e73b423768a73f8d918732","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1658099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bahman Maghsoudlou","original_name":"Bahman Maghsoudlou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e73b4ad7bcca524db0bfcf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0315204","wikidata_id":"Q15052448","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
