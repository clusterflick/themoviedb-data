In this programme, celebrities and historians reveal that modern Britain is still defined by the battle between the two tribes. The Cavaliers represent a Britain of panache, pleasure and individuality. They are confronted by the Roundheads, who stand for modesty, discipline, equality and state intervention. The ideas which emerged 350 years ago shaped our democracy, civil liberties and constitution. They also create a cultural divide that influences how we live, what we wear and even what we eat and drink. Individuals usually identify with one tribe or the other, but sometimes they need some elements of the enemy's identity.","popularity":0.2184,"poster_path":"/tSLj85FQVmXiSFgKIPOIfWAve9z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roundhead or Cavalier: Which One Are You?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen McCrory","original_name":"Helen McCrory","popularity":0.9074,"profile_path":"/3FyO7Z8WigeCQsUpW4B1x3qfmFx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66e7b4fd9dfbbdf0e6cfd815","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71571,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philippa Gregory","original_name":"Philippa Gregory","popularity":0.193,"profile_path":"/xzXrtl1mdSPUsOJuhJ7DoNOs7Nk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66e7b513dd224d1a3991acac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3260321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronald Hutton","original_name":"Ronald Hutton","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/t50SaqFTn24J6Wo01HjIO2uuyPt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66e7b5223768a73f8d91af05","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1220213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarissa Dickson Wright","original_name":"Clarissa Dickson Wright","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/2aTpZpxPtvDeDlfuJtOzyccVMQr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66e7b5369dfbbdf0e6cfd83f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":212490,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Colville","original_name":"Charles Colville","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e7b5559dfbbdf0e6cfd858","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":212490,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Colville","original_name":"Charles Colville","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f23a3bfc009839148d6089","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1237822,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Granlund","original_name":"Chris Granlund","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f23a4dc237258e4c26c827","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1336155,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Guy Crossman","original_name":"Guy Crossman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f23a5bfc009839148d609c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446362,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gerard Evans","original_name":"Gerard Evans","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f23a64de2d52dfbd8d674b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2289758","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tSLj85FQVmXiSFgKIPOIfWAve9z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
