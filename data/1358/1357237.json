The film, which consists of four chapters and an epilogue, talks about mid-pregnancy and mental illness based on a private narrative, overlaps the experience of discrimination from other generations, and looks back on the boundaries that divide the parties and non-parties. Through the five stories, we want to find the possibility of connections that can counter discrimination and hatred.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What bonds us","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"KIM Yoonkyum","original_name":"KIM Yoonkyum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e7b7a1050f14e4fccfcf7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"YUN Nuri","original_name":"YUN Nuri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e7b7aad7bcca524db0eb3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945041,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"YEO Inseo","original_name":"YEO Inseo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e7b7b4050f14e4fccfcf93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4945042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoo Jae-won","original_name":"유재원","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e7b7bce8211ecd22b0d788","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945044,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"LIM Subin","original_name":"LIM Subin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e7b7c5050f14e4fccfcfa0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"당신과 나를 잇는 법 What bonds us│기획전 Focus│16TH DMZ Docs Trailer","key":"wJwD95GaGLs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-09-04T07:30:28.000Z","id":"66e7b772d7bcca524db0eb31"}]}}}
