The truth of the events was well-known after the testimony of two survivors, but the case was investigated by the military justice that guaranteed the thesis of the confrontation. Later, the Inter-American Court of Human rights vindicates the fishermen and sentences against the Venezuelan State a sentence that 20 years later has been fulfilled partially, being material, intellectual and concealing the authors free and, in some cases, high positions to be able. This is a history of injustice and abuse authority, but also of perseverance and fights to clean the names of those humble fishermen, in spite of the passed time.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/22kQLkpdKpq2YitkLt4lVYThUuW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239258,"logo_path":null,"name":"PROVEA","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Masacre de El Amparo: 20 años de impunidad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1691906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rober Calzadilla","original_name":"Rober Calzadilla","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sryJ4RDU0iukaH0pfFJwk7OR3g0.jpg","credit_id":"66e97a7eb66746dd790acb63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4947134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodolfo A.
