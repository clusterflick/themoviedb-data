A hyper- technological megalopolis dotted with giant screens and lights, Tokyo reveals itself here with a disturbing face, like the omen of a future already realized. The soundtrack is composed of electromagnetic waves and radio waves captured in urban spaces and expresses the sensory and energetic density of the places.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shinkansen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4946206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Périard","original_name":"Claude Périard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e8a1f44bbab4de9b617ec4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
