Dizaineri","overview":"Unearthing layers of earth, melting, shaping, and creating for the future. The practices of Germans Ermičs and Artis Nīmanis differ, so do the materials they use, yet both are among the most internationally acclaimed Latvian designers. What unites them is their dedication to materiality, though they each follow different personal and creative paths. Ermičs’ “magic of material and colour” emerges from glass, marble, and metal – he moves freely between the Netherlands, Latvia, and Portugal, as well as between the disciplines of design and visual art. Meanwhile in Latvia, under the brand “an&angel” Nīmanis deconstructs the concept of glass – in each of his pieces, he breathes a sense of the presence of nature.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/sZ7fyFAZLmkyOG1TXehhakmh3Dr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2024-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mission Latvian.
