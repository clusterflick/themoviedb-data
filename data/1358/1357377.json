But now they find themselves at a dinner with Ville’s brother Leo, someone a lot of people would refer to as a “free spirit”. Agnes has a dark secret she wants to remain hidden, an affair of infidelity with Leo, that she has called off because of the engagement. But her worry of the secret being exposed, is instead turned into jealousy and disgust when Leo’s new girlfriend SASHA turns up unannounced.
