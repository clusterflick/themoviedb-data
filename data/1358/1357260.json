Their goal: to break up the automotive consensus - to open a window of opportunity through creative campaigns and colorful actions together with militant workers.  Their goal was to reach the conversion of production to things we really need - and socialization - the factory for those who work in it.  The film, with some action scenes and many interview passages, shows the effectiveness of direct action on social awareness. “It doesn't take many to make a difference,” the activists and workers are convinced. It's about thinking about the social and ecological issues together and acting accordingly.","popularity":0.1451,"poster_path":"/445lQCGcAPJJXETjotdPH8aLH1g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Struggling workers & creative activists break up the automotive consensus","title":"Wolfsburg - mobility transition town","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tobi Rosswog","original_name":"Tobi Rosswog","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"66e7d5d2dd224d1a3991b7b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lotte Herzberg","original_name":"Lotte Herzberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"herself","credit_id":"66e7d5e9dd224d1a3991b7cc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lars Hirsekorn","original_name":"Lars Hirsekorn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"himself","credit_id":"66e7d5fed7bcca524db0f281","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Schlosser","original_name":"Nina Schlosser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"herself","credit_id":"66e7d617dd224d1a3991b7f8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toto Bleibaum","original_name":"Toto Bleibaum","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"himself","credit_id":"66e7d62b050f14e4fccfd86a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Riesenbeck","original_name":"Laura Riesenbeck","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"herself","credit_id":"66e7d63edd224d1a3991b821","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Mio Mehnert","original_name":"John Mio Mehnert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e7d4e7e8211ecd22b0e34d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4945104,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maximiliano Dilger","original_name":"Maximiliano Dilger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e7d5829dfbbdf0e6cfe223","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/445lQCGcAPJJXETjotdPH8aLH1g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mdS2noDkTnZYEJLj1KnQO8Po3YJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3469,"name":"utopia"},{"id":231075,"name":"transition"},{"id":328240,"name":"mobility justice"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Film-Doku \"VerkehrsWendestadt Wolfsburg\" Trailer","key":"-J97-EXIV_o","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-08-01T13:48:45.000Z","id":"66e7d22b9dfbbdf0e6cfe010"}]}}}
