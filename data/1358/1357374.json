The wet box is a cyberspace cut like a spiral, an incomplete turn. Fracture of language, possibility of opening. \"If a horse is plasticized, it cannot be ridden\". Technology is part of feedback systems that constitute cognition / the mapping of the environment, the shape of value, the shape of morality. It reconstructs the pointing finger, the speaking gesture, the hole that looks. The wet box deals with the virtuality of the body that abstracts itself, the sign incapable of defining itself, the language that is performed, the pieces / of an abstract / machine.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/gMmy8GgDXLJHws5BqLCx7OYDBWI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"the wet box","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4620234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Margo","original_name":"Ian Margo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e820159dfbbdf0e6cffa81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4620234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Margo","original_name":"Ian Margo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e820349dfbbdf0e6cffa8d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4620234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Margo","original_name":"Ian Margo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e820483768a73f8d91d169","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4719687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcos Parajua","original_name":"Marcos Parajua","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e8205ae8211ecd22b10246","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gMmy8GgDXLJHws5BqLCx7OYDBWI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
