Romero Filmmaking Program, with special effects by Tom Savini's Special Make-up Effects Program. The story involves iconic zombie extras from the original Dawn and Day of the Dead who, decades later, find themselves in demand at Pop Culture Comicons. We chase down these zombies to see why these early Romero films resonate so much with fans. Meanwhile, the crew shooting this film set out on a horrifying adventure of their own.","popularity":0.0655,"poster_path":"/lmHy2d6no0AdpGIhnMiP8wAIXzM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A TRIBUTE TO GEORGE ROMERO.
