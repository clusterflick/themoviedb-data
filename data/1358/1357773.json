Weirdness is his beat. It all starts the day the local TV station plays a twelve-hour monster movie marathon, followed by a trivia contest. Archie should have known something was wrong when Jughead actually wins!  It turns out, the TV station has been invaded by a body-snatching space spud. When the bad guys are supernatural, all bets are off. Archie faces his greatest challenge yet when Riverdale is invaded by a gang of hungry vampires.  Things come to a chilling climax at Veronica's Halloween party as Reggie, Betty, Jughead and Archie are turned into vampires, one by one - until only Veronica is left to save the world! But can she do it without messing up her hairdo or breaking a nail...?","popularity":0.608,"poster_path":"/xuHoJs2gMDInKOal0CMQQjNqWQQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10713,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Studios Home Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Archie's Weird Mysteries: Archie and the Riverdale Vampires","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":990369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Rannells","original_name":"Andrew Rannells","popularity":1.6871,"profile_path":"/wOXFZssfq3wymBwuiMNVNBpPENB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Archie Andrews / Vampire #2","credit_id":"66e93a1082ff873f7d1e9ab8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":63333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"America Young","original_name":"America Young","popularity":0.1924,"profile_path":"/xxAr9L5Cto6q4H0nnxvhnnre1Qe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Betty Cooper","credit_id":"66e93a8282ff873f7d1e9ae1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1234672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camille Schmidt","original_name":"Camille Schmidt","popularity":0.1966,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Veronica Lodge / Actress on Television","credit_id":"66e93aa71beca8ce07d2b8ca","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1234673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Lundquist","original_name":"Chris Lundquist","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jughead Jones","credit_id":"66e93ac6b2917eb1800ab11f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1234674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Sosso","original_name":"Paul Sosso","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Reggie Mantle","credit_id":"66e93ae0b66746dd790aad28","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1234675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Beck","original_name":"Ben Beck","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Dilton Doiley","credit_id":"66e93b065168a896e11e9970","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryle Smith","original_name":"Ryle Smith","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Pop Tate / Hot Dog","credit_id":"66e93b36b2917eb1800ab125","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1022714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pam Carter","original_name":"Pam Carter","popularity":0.1347,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Andrews / Reporter on Television","credit_id":"66e93b9db2917eb1800ab178","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4946819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Bross","original_name":"Matt Bross","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Great Potato","credit_id":"66e93bc9b2917eb1800ab1a9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4946822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Phillips","original_name":"Michele Phillips","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Scarlet","credit_id":"66e93bf65c0519a234d2bf8b","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":223921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Longe","original_name":"Jerry Longe","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Dr. Beaumont / Smithers","credit_id":"66e93c15b2917eb1800ab1cf","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1234673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Lundquist","original_name":"Chris Lundquist","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Vampire #1","credit_id":"66e93c295168a896e11e9a32","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4946825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill McGuigan","original_name":"Bill McGuigan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Nilnewz","credit_id":"66e93c74b2917eb1800ab212","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2581938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Michael Lee","original_name":"John Michael Lee","popularity":0.0845,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Medlock","credit_id":"66e93ca85c0519a234d2bfd8","order":13}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xuHoJs2gMDInKOal0CMQQjNqWQQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AkaOSdwUbMREgU7wDmBjBJfyMDi.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2000-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
