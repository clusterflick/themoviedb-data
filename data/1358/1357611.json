The original films of the Netsilik series attempted to recreate the traditional lifestyle of Netsilingmiut living there. They show the incredible resourcefulness of the Netsilik (People of the Seal) who have adapted to one of the world's harshest environments. Part 1: Eskimo Summer shows how Inuit families prepare for winter by hunting seal, birds and caribou and by fishing for Arctic Char during the extended hours of daylight.","popularity":0.3859,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"People of the Seal, Part 1: Eskimo Summer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Scourby","original_name":"Alexander Scourby","popularity":0.24,"profile_path":"/uPpBJ11bObJc7piXl2e2Lbt4OuU.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"66e8f6415c0519a234d2a7a6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":969626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanley Jackson","original_name":"Stanley Jackson","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e8ab6abb8361a1d6a9dbfd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":969626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanley Jackson","original_name":"Stanley Jackson","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e8acb000000000004b1de3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4946641,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Robinson","original_name":"Richard Robinson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e8f2af82ff873f7d1e845c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1448132,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael McKennirey","original_name":"Michael McKennirey","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e8f2d1b2917eb1800a9946","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945496,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Colin Hill","original_name":"Colin Hill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e8f3245c0519a234d2a744","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2984892,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Asen Balikci","original_name":"Asen Balikci","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e8f36a5168a896e11e843e","department":"Crew","job":"Supervisor of Production Resources"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4946649,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Malca Gillson","original_name":"Malca Gillson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e8f3915168a896e11e844a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354842,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ken Page","original_name":"Ken Page","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e8f3a0b2917eb1800a9983","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2557295,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Don Wellington","original_name":"Don Wellington","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e8f3b11beca8ce07d2a35d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1499548,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"André Galbrand","original_name":"André Galbrand","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e8f3cdb66746dd790a981a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1410992,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roger Lamoureux","original_name":"Roger Lamoureux","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e8f44282ff873f7d1e84ab","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4946650,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Branston","original_name":"Brian Branston","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e8f47882ff873f7d1e84c5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4946651,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Pearson","original_name":"George Pearson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e8f49f1beca8ce07d2a39b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223906","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3355,"name":"inuit"},{"id":229303,"name":"nunavut"},{"id":237188,"name":"ethnography"},{"id":288649,"name":"arctic"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
