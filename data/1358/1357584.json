Cinematographer and friend, Stephen Chung was there, behind the lens of his camera, capturing it all. Words were not his strong suit, but his camera was. Friendships, relationships, business and art… Stephen lovingly documents the highs and lows of a band who only wanted to create music on their own terms, and ended up changing everything. It is a celebration of the creative process, an homage to art and artists, and a love letter to the community and city which allowed it to thrive. With actual footage from a time before everyone had a camera in their pocket, It’s All Gonna Break is a time capsule showing how special those moments were, and how they helped form the people we are today.","popularity":0.2055,"poster_path":"/EiILMRR2SGmHm4tRI7CryZlpLM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's All Gonna Break","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2156351,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stephen Chung","original_name":"Stephen Chung","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66eb8eef5168a896e11fc62d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":745,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zOWpuLdfxGfjJ7diL4ZwXO3vPsq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1326}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":2954,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/EiILMRR2SGmHm4tRI7CryZlpLM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":894,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rbVmUYhmBIIr4LH2jgJ5QZcp0wA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":596}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Woodstock Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
