By speaking in allegorical terms, they avoid addressing their dreadful condition directly. Only one character is different - liberated from such condition. Their love affairs will start to permeate their points of view. The fiction of a movie they’re discussing will blend with their own story. In a world where people live forever, certain things won’t be possible: \"there's a novelty, there's a lie, there's a death.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/pmwqjnXP5mEDEhqbn0oYqOXHjLq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ahold of Get the Things To","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4946860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Unn Faleide","original_name":"Unn Faleide","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Unn","credit_id":"66e9515c1beca8ce07d2c577","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4946861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Hillen","original_name":"Luca Hillen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Luca","credit_id":"66e951785168a896e11ea398","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4946863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niels Weijer","original_name":"Niels Weijer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Niels","credit_id":"66e9518b1beca8ce07d2c5a9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4946864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veniamin Kazachenko","original_name":"Veniamin Kazachenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Veniamin","credit_id":"66e9519ab2917eb1800abe66","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Jacoby","original_name":"Daniel Jacoby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ikEbOkGHVsm4dNsQXrwkI3DyFNQ.jpg","credit_id":"66e951ac1beca8ce07d2c5bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Jacoby","original_name":"Daniel Jacoby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ikEbOkGHVsm4dNsQXrwkI3DyFNQ.jpg","credit_id":"66e951b682ff873f7d1ea55a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682674,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Liisa Hirsch","original_name":"Liisa Hirsch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e951c31beca8ce07d2c5d7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4946865,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Andrew de Freitas","original_name":"Andrew de Freitas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e951de5c0519a234d2c74c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Jacoby","original_name":"Daniel Jacoby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ikEbOkGHVsm4dNsQXrwkI3DyFNQ.jpg","credit_id":"672ca3ca7967e06110ecddd4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9wdG84mSxNXEP1WejTSz3EDAuwW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1667,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pmwqjnXP5mEDEhqbn0oYqOXHjLq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1120}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ahold of Get the Things To | 2014 | CLIP","key":"130445227","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-06-11T14:50:04.000Z","id":"66e95127b2917eb1800abe1c"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ahold of Get the Things To [2012, teaser]","key":"89505909","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2014-03-19T13:53:48.000Z","id":"66e9513e1beca8ce07d2c53c"}]}}}
