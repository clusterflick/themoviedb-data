Interviews with Jollyâ€™s network of colleagues, her daughter, and science studies scholar Donna Haraway are animated by the species they study: lemurs, a langur monkey, and Cayenne the dog. Jolly (1937-2014) was known for her pioneering theory on the evolution of social intelligence developed through her study of prosimians. Her scientific and conservation work drew worldwide attention to the unique ecosystem of Madagascar. In the film, many voices articulate the significance of her scientific discoveries as well as her career: group living over tool making as a driver for evolution, her description of a female dominant primate society, the role of play in learning, as well as her place in the first generation of women in the field of primatology and her development of community-based conservation.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/U8R0BNO3GwsKIxCeKYJlvaMgg6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jollies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2807253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Mayeri","original_name":"Rachel Mayeri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e7108d0000000000dc1874","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/U8R0BNO3GwsKIxCeKYJlvaMgg6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
