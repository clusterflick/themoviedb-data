Bodies And Places Are Contiguous is a visual experiment, an effort to attend to the recurrent cylindrical formations that permeate human bodies, our technology, our parasites, and most of our cities’ infrastructures. Through a focus on form, the project seeks to generate unexpected connections between categories often seen as entirely separate from each other. The connections that emerge from the repeated attention to tubes are also seen as a challenge to traditionally bounded understandings of the human, the body, and the world. In the film, as inside of any tube, perspective is lost, there is no up nor down, inside or outside, just a dizzying encounter with sameness. Music score improvised by Marina Peterson and Cassius Walker.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/uZMa7fYHguravBFce7oWukKRDO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A visual experiment linking bodies, parasites, and infrastructure","title":"Bodies and Places are Contiguous","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3846706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Fernandez Pello","original_name":"Maria Fernandez Pello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e71f719dfbbdf0e6cf9e0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uZMa7fYHguravBFce7oWukKRDO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
