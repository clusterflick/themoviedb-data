Once a year, the adolescent birds perform a dance that looks like... flamenco! But when the flock is attacked by hateful podencos (wild dogs) our heroine Rosie, a fun, dance crazy flamingo, loses her beloved sister and the flamenco is cancelled henceforth. She grows up a shadow of her former self, robbed of her sisters love and the joy of dance. One day she meets Carlos, an exuberant lizard, who encourages her to dance once more - rekindling her inner flame. Over time, she transforms back into her old confident self, before leading her flock to face down the podencos and dance once more.","popularity":0.1906,"poster_path":"/qn5TfAlXlr3xbzhGcGZLnz3vpUD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68112,"logo_path":"/if4Ubr4OoqjnBOVf7bfT0XmGOqq.png","name":"Studio 100 Media","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":117634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sygnatia","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":112266,"logo_path":null,"name":"3 Doubles Producciones","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"Everything's gonna be olé","title":"Flamin­go Flamenco","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016991,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Manuel Cristóbal","original_name":"Manuel Cristóbal","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b3948176a94011b086a1c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":136515,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rob Sprackling","original_name":"Rob Sprackling","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/78hTfwOmqdcFa8XJSv4aCTg412F.jpg","credit_id":"657b391ee93e9521900de5cd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3364161,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dario Sanchez","original_name":"Dario Sanchez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b397c7a3c5200ebff272e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2057879,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thorsten Wegener","original_name":"Thorsten Wegener","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b3936a0be28013a24ea55","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3448943,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin Krieger","original_name":"Martin Krieger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b63b9e60c51d0148d0ef54","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":136515,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rob Sprackling","original_name":"Rob Sprackling","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/78hTfwOmqdcFa8XJSv4aCTg412F.jpg","credit_id":"6748b8792a5622b10571895b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5087851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raúl García","original_name":"Raúl García","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6748b928a65145f558db077f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1227623,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Cummins","original_name":"Paul Cummins","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679a20753d5e6b33ec27a81d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4390464,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cathy Ni Fhlaithearta","original_name":"Cathy Ni Fhlaithearta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679a20ad83d7aae2f027ab63","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30427310","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":821,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xWsMCzL9iv8Bm8aRvoFIHe2vnRy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1460},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":821,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tda4rXv483T8jYKyJWLhwYnafdZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1460},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":858,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/de5dkuFT4UK7QFizYB1rNtLqzUl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1525}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qn5TfAlXlr3xbzhGcGZLnz3vpUD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1097,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9CctSvhvlhjoX8gHosfL7Pjbny2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Flamingo Flamenco - Teaser - Studio100 Film","key":"vxpkKTPx61I","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2024-02-15T12:44:08.000Z","id":"65ce8ec49f37b0016123d0fb"}]}}}
