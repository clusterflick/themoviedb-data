Since its creation in 1867, the canalâ€™s murky bottom has absorbed over a century of industrial pollutants and raw sewage. Yet the canal retains a unique rustic beauty due to this very toxicity. The film asks us to open our eyes and ears to meet a hidden world submerged within this forgotten and neglected estuary.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":187495,"logo_path":null,"name":"Small Gauge","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What the Sea Left Behind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2298601,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kevin T.
