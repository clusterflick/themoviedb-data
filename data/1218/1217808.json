C is a restless dreamer and B is a pragmatic thinker, but both are determined to change their destiny and save the town. Dom Fradique unravels the adventures of these twin cats who, although choosing distinct paths, embody the transformation of both the place they inhabit as well as their own selves, echoing present day themes that unsettle younger generations and the challenges they face, on a social, ecological and political level. What they discover will change them, their lives, and their town forever.","popularity":0.0762,"poster_path":"/6IsooAHkXMicME7fcMEINbHRU7l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207709,"logo_path":"/p8FUmUtjjIheg23uY5Zgs2slmvX.png","name":"Ocidental Filmes","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":207708,"logo_path":"/2EHQ13Dt1cAFYJTEsAyx9f3dKQt.png","name":"Graffiti Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Dom Fradique","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3946606,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Zepe","original_name":"Zepe","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657afec8ec8a4300fd7f2895","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1063381,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luis Correia","original_name":"Luis Correia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b1760e93e95218dcd06f9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3946606,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Zepe","original_name":"Zepe","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657aff0a564ec700feb6942c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951631,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Enrica Capra","original_name":"Enrica Capra","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b177263e6fb013b45c42e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1276682,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Regina Guimarães","original_name":"Regina Guimarães","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/9JwFcyjuTHrzpJsTjsbm7HraCS1.jpg","credit_id":"657b16cc7a3c52012d01e470","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4429799,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vincent Henry","original_name":"Vincent Henry","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b17308e2ba600fe7356cd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6IsooAHkXMicME7fcMEINbHRU7l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
