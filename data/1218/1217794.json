In different times and places: a man loses his mother; two girls find each other during WWII; a thorn grows out of a hearts hatred; a horse-jumping champion finds herself captive; two primitives re-discover one another, before language. All their experiences converge into a single story, that of human existence, and its all about learning to ride these emotions, finally moving on. A horse, symbol of strength and freedom, appears in every chapter, guiding the transformation, carrying a deeper meaning.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/ep7gR2sMLTmkdPM1iA0y73yBjZg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":216038,"logo_path":null,"name":"IBRIDO Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Dark Horses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1781272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Salvatore Centoducati","original_name":"Salvatore Centoducati","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657af688564ec70138bdc8c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1781271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Massimo Ottoni","original_name":"Massimo Ottoni","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657af699564ec70138bdc8cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4429651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francesco Forti","original_name":"Francesco Forti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657af6bfe93e95218eabf7b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2613036,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Linda Kelvink","original_name":"Linda Kelvink","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657af6cf8e2ba600e1fcd540","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4062983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Victoria Musci","original_name":"Victoria Musci","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657af6dd7a3c52012d01dbee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ep7gR2sMLTmkdPM1iA0y73yBjZg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
