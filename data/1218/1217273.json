From this question, Emina Suljovic, a Bosnian hematologist, shares the first thought that comes to her mind to create a mental map that reveals both herself and the relationship she has with Sarajevo, her native city. In short, Rerun is an internal dialogue carried out through the memories and reflections of Emina, who works with terminal patients, who grew up in the midst of the Sarajevo war between 1992-1995 and who devoutly practices the Muslim religion in a contemporary world. All this in the same way that we repeat a past event in our minds.","popularity":0.1972,"poster_path":"/j2Ms69ZwW8Fxa6qVc9UGZkbGXwz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92814,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sarajevo Film Academy","origin_country":"BA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}],"release_date":"2018-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rerun","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4951605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emina Suljović","original_name":"Emina Suljović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"66ec5267e08b18d3aafa80dd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4427486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chrystyan Romero","original_name":"Chrystyan Romero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6579435c20ecaf00e3929ba3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4427486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chrystyan Romero","original_name":"Chrystyan Romero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ec524d373c0ccc9cfa8078","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":838,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j2Ms69ZwW8Fxa6qVc9UGZkbGXwz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":559}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
