His chaffey chains and lingering bitterness from working with mean-old-Scrooge has kept him from getting his wings. While the menagerie of whimsical characters around him sing boisterous songs and pull pranks on hapless humans, he wanders the cobblestone streets of London in a perpetual monologue of boo-hoo, poor me. His only friend is a quiet Raven who loyally looks out for him. But this all changes one Autumn day when Maybelline, Marleys tough-love angel parole ofﬁcer gives him an off-the-record opportunity: scare Scrooge into becoming a better man and Marley can earn his wings!","popularity":0.0637,"poster_path":"/mUSOEKIrpGvPEQHFk4ktHtvnuLz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19437,"logo_path":"/1VqbDOThEcmDR6gn7et7cAs4lwr.png","name":"Paul Thiltges Distributions","origin_country":"LU"},{"id":50448,"logo_path":"/lnlajcX2bQOdE1ZySFwQpsgakZS.png","name":"Fish Blowing Bubbles","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":122128,"logo_path":"/iYPn1TwMpJXPRTF9O0m4h0nEmCS.png","name":"Special Touch Studios","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":150709,"logo_path":"/k8bq9OvcZ8McsDtbxQQB6WPS69l.png","name":"GFM Animation","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":216062,"logo_path":null,"name":"Humbugged Productions Ltd","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Humbugged","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61371,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Todd Edwards","original_name":"Todd Edwards","popularity":0.0699,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b40d7564ec7011b217cea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61371,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Todd Edwards","original_name":"Todd Edwards","popularity":0.0699,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b40deec8a4300c33b54e5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2895648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Hooten","original_name":"Timothy Hooten","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b40e98e2ba600e1fce63e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2895648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Hooten","original_name":"Timothy Hooten","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b40ed7ecd28013b3ec49c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1555020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seán McCormack","original_name":"Seán McCormack","popularity":0.0628,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b40f9ec8a4300c33b54f3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2421186,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adrien Chef","original_name":"Adrien Chef","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b41077a3c52010cdfaf9c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1449859,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arthur Kubiczek","original_name":"Arthur Kubiczek","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b411a564ec700e10df877","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1688079,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sébastien Onomo","original_name":"Sébastien Onomo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b4127ec8a4300c33b5501","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62983,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guy Collins","original_name":"Guy Collins","popularity":0.0864,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b413ca1d33229e25ed8eb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3557,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Dickens","original_name":"Charles Dickens","popularity":0.5721,"profile_path":"/vuy9knaprX05bT4WNJki5iDPfsK.jpg","credit_id":"657b418d7ecd2800c70d2d8c","department":"Writing","job":"Characters"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13609712","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":1640,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mUSOEKIrpGvPEQHFk4ktHtvnuLz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1120},{"aspect_ratio":0.683,"height":1047,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ymQsJy9gQUwfMnoS2aPFw43jxU5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":715}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
