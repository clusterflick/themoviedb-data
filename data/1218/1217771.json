He crafted his first instrument in 1962. He thinks of his work as a sort of re-creation, a form of alchemy, transforming natural materials into living, breathing instruments. A well-crafted instrument is not only defined by the age, treatment, and construction of its materials, but it also continues to grow and adapt with use. In 2009, Kevin T. Allen brought him a door salvaged from his family home lost to fire. He transformed it into a beautiful handcrafted flamenco guitar.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":"/gwOdzPqqxvVzauwjkNwvgUJxhT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187495,"logo_path":null,"name":"Small Gauge","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luthier","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4429543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raul Orlando Perez","original_name":"Raul Orlando Perez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"657ae364a1d33229dc329a13","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2298601,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kevin T.
