From high explosives to clandestine home brew, his video footage and witty narrative combine personal musings on life, death, and the future he imagined but would never see. His charming buddy, Matthew, who barely survived, brings the war home. Through Jonathan's handwritten words and videotape, the film tells a personal and profound story.","popularity":0.106,"poster_path":"/hTa0AvQeVdXz8nknQ3ojTEvUNJl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Corporal's Diary","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1042214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurel Spellman","original_name":"Laurel Spellman","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657945ba7a3c5200ca7a7011","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4427501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Boiko","original_name":"Patrick Boiko","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657945cfec8a4300fd7e8b06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1308637","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hTa0AvQeVdXz8nknQ3ojTEvUNJl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
