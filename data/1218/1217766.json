It is also the tale of two elderly proprietors who devotedly maintain these sites. Such roadside attractions conjure the mythical West through material and cultural artifacts, from a decrepit wagon wheel to an out-of-tune player piano. Tourists are encouraged to not only experience but also to re-enact these historical environments. The film uses contact microphones and super-8mm film as archaeological tools to uncover the material traces of this living history.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/qDiJUEhVA66AMjpwHJMEO5OAs5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187495,"logo_path":null,"name":"Small Gauge","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Real West","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2298601,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kevin T.
