When she is diagnosed with a rare sleeping disorder, called narcolepsy, her life takes a sudden turn. Her parents become very protective, limiting her freedom. Her reluctance to talk about her condition only makes her drift even further away from her friends. One day a boy appears in her dreams. He has lost his memory and seems to be stuck in Lucy's dream world. After some initial resentment, she bonds with her strange visitor, and they embark on a dreamy quest to find the key to his mystery. During the journey, the boy will help Lucy to take back control of her life, and accept her condition. Simultaneously, Lucy will need to fight a battle in the real world to save her new-found friendship.","popularity":0.0814,"poster_path":"/1RM5eqfDjX2bBVbfUX2nVX1VyfD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7489,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vivi Film","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Dreamwalker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006643,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Rudi Mertens","original_name":"Rudi Mertens","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b2120e93e95218eac011f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1402141,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wouter van Haver","original_name":"Wouter van Haver","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b2128176a9400e1309ed0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130130,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Thijs De Cloedt","original_name":"Thijs De Cloedt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b21358e2ba600e1fcdfb1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Character Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1857687,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florian Perron","original_name":"Florian Perron","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b2145ec8a4300e09b6bef","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Character Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1626544,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emma McCann","original_name":"Emma McCann","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b2152ec8a4300c33b4e68","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Character Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1122402,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Veerle Appelmans","original_name":"Veerle Appelmans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b2171564ec700e10df13c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1057,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jPm1Z9HTrIMHrIeytD10ht7RGTl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1879}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1RM5eqfDjX2bBVbfUX2nVX1VyfD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
