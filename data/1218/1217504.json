Marje prefers dashing young cattle inspector Frank Thornby and runs away from school. Jim finds Marje and brings her home. Pop is waiting for his disobedient daughter. Marje has a lot of explaining to do, and a lot of cajoling if she's to marry Frank instead of Jim. A slapstick battle of wills follows between Pop and Marje.\"  —iancraine@supanet.com","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cowcatcher’s Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0021767","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
