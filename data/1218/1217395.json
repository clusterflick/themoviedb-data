The community center is ostensibly a non-profit volunteer organization, but in reality, it uses the elderly and infirm to help the organization to engage in criminal activities and make huge profits. A group of young volunteers from the center gather secretly in the basement every night, and the master trainer brainwashes them with the idea of hating the rich and making the world a better place by assassinating the rich and committing drug crimes for the organization, so that they can regain the goal of their lives and help the organization loyally.","popularity":0.1649,"poster_path":"/cDe56WlwgXwyUpBHM90qO17ggI3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215958,"logo_path":null,"name":"Utopia Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2021-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Young The Old and The Rich","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"坚尼地道杀人事件","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Young The Old and The Rich","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Wong","original_name":"黃秋生","popularity":2.0263,"profile_path":"/7UYRnOZXSmJFcQGPBUSFbyY07zZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6579afee7a3c5200ca7a9262","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lam Yiu-Sing","original_name":"林耀聲","popularity":0.2097,"profile_path":"/hPMod2vIErDW7EexOVLspsjMCw2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6579affc564ec7011b210156","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1780961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zeno Koo","original_name":"顧定軒","popularity":0.1078,"profile_path":"/uGK9JHfuv7fzcNTXDyp6B9BHbbu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6579b01135a61e011decb3f9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3538714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gratiano Wong","original_name":"黃根鳴","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6579c48eec8a43013700486d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2465291,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ronnie Chau","original_name":"Ronnie Chau","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6579b034e93e952192cd085b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2465291,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ronnie Chau","original_name":"Ronnie Chau","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6579c44d4bfa545d001f1ced","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2465291,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ronnie Chau","original_name":"Ronnie Chau","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6579c436ec8a430137004855","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":982,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cDe56WlwgXwyUpBHM90qO17ggI3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":655}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
