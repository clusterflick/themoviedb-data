Michael Clegg takes us on a journey around the places that inspired both authors, Whitby and Robin Hood’s Bay, just five miles apart on the Yorkshire coast. With the help of excerpts from two films based on their novels, ‘Turn of the Tide’ (1935), and ‘Scars of Dracula’ (1970), Clegg provides a guide to their work and the very different tales they have to tell.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12476,"logo_path":"/A8X93JHJONB6YXYYRmYWKajp9lg.png","name":"Yorkshire Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":100371,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trident Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dracula and the Turn of the Tide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4429744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Clegg","original_name":"Michael Clegg","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"657b0d12a0be280100d7b743","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4429737,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mostafa Hammuri","original_name":"Mostafa Hammuri","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b0c1ee93e9521910a479a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4429735,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Hartley","original_name":"Robert Hartley","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b0bfb63e6fb00e3cd91fc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1547374,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brian Tomkins","original_name":"Brian Tomkins","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b0c46ea394900e1e85d9c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1244072,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Trevor Hodgson","original_name":"Trevor Hodgson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b0c067ecd280101d32aff","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4429736,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christine Sharman","original_name":"Christine Sharman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b0c1263e6fb00add2ffc0","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689764,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Chris Clarkson","original_name":"Chris Clarkson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b0c2e8e2ba6011b671bcc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4310511,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Gerrard","original_name":"David Gerrard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b0bd6e93e9521900ddca3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4429741,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Wilford","original_name":"John Wilford","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b0c6363e6fb011edd45dd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4429739,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alan Bedwood","original_name":"Alan Bedwood","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b0c3b63e6fb013b45c1ef","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5188766,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank Smith","original_name":"Frank Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678c4fd2a93ce48bca431757","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34379023","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
