The “laughing disorder” that apparently afflicts these women is likened to “the wild, cruel laughter of war.” There is no real path to recovery, no hope of finding happiness during peacetime. The women have been irrevocably changed by the war and counted now among its millions of victims.","popularity":0.0913,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Survivor of the Laughing Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304947,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tat Binh Dang","original_name":"Tat Binh Dang","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b48cbe93e95218dcd11a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1304584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trần Phương","original_name":"Trần Phương","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/6XppuK9ktHRzgrOSPZ2Phb0QSOy.jpg","credit_id":"657b48fd7ecd28013b3ec658","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30333623","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
