Mimi is a dog from a painting. Leaping out of her picture and into the real world, she recruits the proud dog Harold, a lover of art, and leaps with him back into the fully alive world of paintings. Travelling together through the dizzying history of painting, from Da Vinci to Marc, the two will have to be brave and smart in their race against time - for, all around them, these artworks are gradually disappearing. Mimi and Harold make their way to Mimis painter, to convince her to pick up her palette again and bring the endangered paintings back to life!","popularity":0.2155,"poster_path":"/zFiN8q2qTa5iAE2dmWIwWWzDijL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ulysses Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":141007,"logo_path":null,"name":"Preamble Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Mimi & Harold - Out of Frame","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Out of Frame","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toby Genkel","original_name":"Toby Genkel","popularity":0.2163,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b6c21176a94011b0874b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1428981,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emely Christians","original_name":"Emely Christians","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b6d14ec8a4300c33b5e5c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4430380,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Manuela von Perfall","original_name":"Manuela von Perfall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b6d02ea39490138989861","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giles New","original_name":"Giles New","popularity":0.1462,"profile_path":"/e0Ap9fkLAFcxLVHpK8KH2TQV3wI.jpg","credit_id":"657b6cdd8e2ba600e1fcef47","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4430381,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laura Portatius","original_name":"Laura Portatius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b6d41564ec70138bddfe1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2447482,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sonja Matthes","original_name":"Sonja Matthes","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b6d2fea394900c4ff8a23","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keiron Self","original_name":"Keiron Self","popularity":0.1291,"profile_path":"/fCLytYxV7itLyPkNG4vuHsfguYF.jpg","credit_id":"657b6ce6a1d33229dfa74f4b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4430382,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Nikolas Lemberg","original_name":"Christian Nikolas Lemberg","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b6d5a7a3c52012d01f6c6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2828,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zFiN8q2qTa5iAE2dmWIwWWzDijL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2999,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/isCAjOmsKLZLIIiSTYWCrKcLLZ4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
