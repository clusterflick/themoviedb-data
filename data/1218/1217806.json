Jules's big sister Lola, a gloomy 17-year-old, is also roped into the journey. Along the trip, Jeanne reveals to her grandchildren that she is endowed with a special gift: she can talk to cats and dogs. Nevertheless, a talking cat will remain a cat haughty, teasing, cuddly, dreamy and a talking dog a dog empathic, hyperactive and generous. Thanks to their grandmother, at the time when they think that their lives are falling apart, Jules and Lola rediscover the extraordinary dormant family legacy within themselves.","popularity":0.0991,"poster_path":"/zVHFYOMhZJsrALZJs4sqp4TaBPC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115962,"logo_path":"/l0XMrl5uKQyUYQiRJAFMMhL5FtH.png","name":"Parmi les lucioles films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Dog my Cats!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145675,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alain Gagnol","original_name":"Alain Gagnol","popularity":0.1208,"profile_path":"/8Jsy2fW7KbhXWXolMhdkd6YWYXl.jpg","credit_id":"657afd8763e6fb013b45be82","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1958661,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jérôme Duc-Mauge","original_name":"Jérôme Duc-Mauge","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657afd987a3c52010cdfa249","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145675,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alain Gagnol","original_name":"Alain Gagnol","popularity":0.1208,"profile_path":"/8Jsy2fW7KbhXWXolMhdkd6YWYXl.jpg","credit_id":"657afd74ea39490138987bdd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/if28BcqvQ8hAb10dp1yJanNJgb5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zVHFYOMhZJsrALZJs4sqp4TaBPC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
