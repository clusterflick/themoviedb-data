The key difference being that we wanted to avoid filming only \"pro\" riders and instead wanted to capture a diverse range of skill levels. The winter of 2021/22 was especially wet in Bellingham with the \"atmospheric river\" bringing in especially foul conditions. Most self respecting mountain bikers would have hung up their helmet for the season but many of our local river rats continued on with their trail building and riding. Despite mud, grit, snow, hail and torrential rain our local riders were still out there. Capturing these creatures in their natural habitat was our goal. We proudly present to \"Atmospheric River Rats\" a Bellingham community mountain bike movie.","popularity":0.2996,"poster_path":"/b914TcQswq6nwIFkSta4PxgSrQU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A community mountain bike movie","title":"Atmospheric River Rats","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4430291,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Olsen","original_name":"Eric Olsen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b5b7a63e6fb00c6e92361","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4430284,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Logan Nelson","original_name":"Logan Nelson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b58bc564ec700acd627d1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4430284,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Logan Nelson","original_name":"Logan Nelson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657b58ac7a3c5200ad1a8819","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b914TcQswq6nwIFkSta4PxgSrQU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10191,"name":"mountain biking"},{"id":180491,"name":"cycling"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"(Trailer) A Winter of Mountain Biking In Bellingham - Atmospheric River Rats","key":"xYUM1A98Yk8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-04-17T21:37:30.000Z","id":"657b5c52176a9400fe8838d0"}]}}}
