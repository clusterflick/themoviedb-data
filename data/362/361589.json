The film is set in a small town somewhere in Brandenburg, a place which is rapidly falling \"outside time\"; since it cannot keep pace with the changes brought about by unification and the transformation of the former GDR. The Russian troops stationed there have withdrawn and their barracks have turned into rat-infested ruins; the intercity trains do not stop there any more and even the regional railway link to Berlin is going to be suspended. Most young people are leaving. When Sophie introduces her lover to her mother and her brother, Sergej becomes embroiled in the incestuous tensions underlying the relationship between Sophie, her brother, Georg, and her mother. The arrival of the Russian implodes the claustrophobic sham existence that held this dysfunctional family together.","popularity":0.4846,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":48911,"logo_path":null,"name":"Euskal Média S.A.","origin_country":""},{"id":23983,"logo_path":"/mwdVAta6xcY8eCpL5t8KKc96BWm.png","name":"SR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":85146,"logo_path":"/2eG5vjJHl7woTbaqjVuWHcNHtGU.png","name":"Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1995-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outside Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Neben der Zeit","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Outside Time","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosel Zech","original_name":"Rosel Zech","popularity":0.5122,"profile_path":"/92YgFnwz0ZCLTj5JqygMRDZCPp1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sophies Mutter","credit_id":"56072383c3a36812110032b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Jäger","original_name":"Julia Jäger","popularity":0.31,"profile_path":"/2XzL2aVhY0oIMRTcemlj9NTJNxW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sophie","credit_id":"5607238ec3a3681218002a05","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvester Groth","original_name":"Sylvester Groth","popularity":0.3648,"profile_path":"/dHkdcwtB8e5aTXC9pUAylso3fP0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Georg","credit_id":"5607239c9251413052002a92","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Schorn","original_name":"Christine Schorn","popularity":0.1502,"profile_path":"/A49dnk5DKnLzlTADAkEAIJQYac0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Frau Plessow","credit_id":"560723aec3a368120d002c12","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1511012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Deiß","original_name":"Victor Deiß","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/pT9zyuhy7QEkuQ5aQFG1PPfE2kt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Polizist","credit_id":"560723bac3a3681215002812","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heidemarie Schneider","original_name":"Heidemarie Schneider","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Kellnerin","credit_id":"5cb38d5d0e0a2626cec91352","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Schweighöfer","original_name":"Michael Schweighöfer","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/xQAuDPIRPyoJjrTVMdGNDrzRW68.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Grambke","credit_id":"5cb38d6c0e0a2626e9c8ed16","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Kleinert","original_name":"Andreas Kleinert","popularity":0.134,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56072373c3a3681218002a01","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0113944","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":221825,"name":"german reunification"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1995-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
