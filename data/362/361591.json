Trecartin's collaborator, Lizzie Fitch, plays a girl obsessed with Valentine's Day. Everything in her hyperactive, sped-up world revolves around Valentine's Day: red, white, and pink love-themed decorations cover every surface; heart shapes abound; Valentine's Day treats are everywhere. Her private festivities suddenly go awry as a hoard of Christmas-themed intruders appear and take her hostage in her own apartment. Gagged and bound, she is forced to watch while her ecstatic but sinister captors stage a frenzied Christmas intervention.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/5CgdiRSmIj2BkX9hZ3oOAJRTMq7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127787,"logo_path":null,"name":"RISD","origin_country":""},{"id":20988,"logo_path":null,"name":"Electronic Arts Intermix","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Valentine's Day Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lizzie Fitch","original_name":"Lizzie Fitch","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/dUZ9QJ1RX2z5ehogZnDVbs6ZsKM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64dfc2cdb77d4b114348b7ca","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3007903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Gurly","original_name":"Will Gurly","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64dfc96bd100b614b15aea98","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2616699,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Asher Penn","original_name":"Asher Penn","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64dfc98237109700c51e888b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3007906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethan Hayes-Chute","original_name":"Ethan Hayes-Chute","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64dfc9a1e19de900c68b38ad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Trecartin","original_name":"Ryan Trecartin","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/iWJgI83UpTedOiZFXvNf8iHWVdC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64dfc9d7d100b614b5f83593","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Trecartin","original_name":"Ryan Trecartin","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/iWJgI83UpTedOiZFXvNf8iHWVdC.jpg","credit_id":"5607256ec3a3681207002e6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5CgdiRSmIj2BkX9hZ3oOAJRTMq7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
