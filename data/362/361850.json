As well as his breath-taking onstage performance, Jumpers for Goalposts is intercut with the story of Ed’s triumphant road to Wembley, presenting a revealing and personal glimpse into life backstage and on the road, along with an honest and intimate reflection by Ed – and those closest to him – on just how far he has come.","popularity":1.5036,"poster_path":"/qZRnpygOdtoxtLZ0e8JSUSMU2kH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64393,"logo_path":null,"name":"JA
