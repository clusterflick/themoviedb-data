Teo has to share a tiny place with Silverio who is already stationed there. They argue with each other over all aspects, including their personality, values and way of living.

them.","popularity":0.3028,"poster_path":"/Akul8Z6Q80X7VHQlEexjS60bscy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64810,"logo_path":null,"name":"Strange
