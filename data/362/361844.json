We face the problem of how to warn the far distant future of the nuclear waste we have buried --but how to do it? How to imagine the far-distant threats to the sites, what kinds of monuments can be built, could stories or legends safeguard our descendants? Filmed at the only American nuclear burial ground, at a nuclear weapons complex and in Fukushima, the film grapples with the ways people are dealing with the present problem and imagining the future. Part observational essay, part graphic novel, this documentary explores the idea that over millennia, nothing stays put.","popularity":0.5376,"poster_path":"/ib7O38QuYFGLdpjKpNNqC8QUwpg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4280,"logo_path":null,"name":"Redacted Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Containment","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robb Moss","original_name":"Robb Moss","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/wNIfIUDxHZKEwPUP0XGR3MhJyku.jpg","credit_id":"56098f89c3a368680e0000d7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robb Moss","original_name":"Robb Moss","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/wNIfIUDxHZKEwPUP0XGR3MhJyku.jpg","credit_id":"5b50e01f0e0a26259900165c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Galison","original_name":"Peter Galison","popularity":0.0742,"profile_path":"/iR35T6xIxGmoSFgpQWBr4kO32R7.jpg","credit_id":"5dc61dd9a14e1000135b327e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Galison","original_name":"Peter Galison","popularity":0.0742,"profile_path":"/iR35T6xIxGmoSFgpQWBr4kO32R7.jpg","credit_id":"5dc61dbc470ead001591e3de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4503606","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ib7O38QuYFGLdpjKpNNqC8QUwpg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2964,"name":"future"},{"id":3275,"name":"nuclear radiation"},{"id":155652,"name":"nuclear"},{"id":195331,"name":"nuclear waste"},{"id":204146,"name":"nuclear catastrophe"},{"id":215355,"name":"fukushima disaster (2011)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"18A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"CONTAINMENT (CLIP)","key":"hSeiUk7BU5A","published_at":"2015-09-21T16:20:42.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"56099047c3a3686810000126"}]}}}
