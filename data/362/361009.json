It is a loose unauthorized adaptation of the 1896 novel The Island of Doctor Moreau by H. G. Wells. Author Wells was allegedly unaware that this unauthorized version of his novel existed.\r Thought at one time to have been lost, a print has turned up at the Bundesarchiv in Berlin, Germany. The film was only screened in the US for the first time at a \"Monster Bash\" convention in 2014. Comments from the attendees included the fact that the film was somewhat illogical, and had more emphasis on comedy and romance than horror, but that it offered \"memorable glimpses of human-animal hybrids\".","popularity":0.6398,"poster_path":"/eKw07zYnt5HKS7FYO5unI7YIvD1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15719,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terra Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1795,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corona Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1921-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Island of the Lost","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Island Of The Lost","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Beckmann","original_name":"Fritz Beckmann","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Jim","credit_id":"560181cc9251412287001a31","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1121602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Behrendt","original_name":"Hans Behrendt","popularity":0.2095,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Pat Quickly","credit_id":"560181e7c3a3685614001b89","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":31813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Umberto Guarracino","original_name":"Umberto Guarracino","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Produkt aus der Geheimwerkstatt des Professors","credit_id":"56018246c3a368372b00168b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nien Tso Ling","original_name":"Nien Tso Ling","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Fung-Lu","credit_id":"56018288c3a368372b001695","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann Picha","original_name":"Hermann Picha","popularity":0.1504,"profile_path":"/rHNFH1lDVQOVioEHNTLhfGPYi0X.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Jess","credit_id":"56018292c3a3685625001b5a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1513458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desdemona Schlichting","original_name":"Desdemona Schlichting","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Letzte Überlebende","credit_id":"560182a69251412287001a4e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":46498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanni Weisse","original_name":"Hanni Weisse","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/fDq6WaODfPI77hTRODOZyJ6HpNI.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Jane Crawford","credit_id":"5836e6f9c3a36836be010b16","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1071740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Urban Gad","original_name":"Urban Gad","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":"/26q6LsIRrQWhbd5BiOViA9QjLup.jpg","credit_id":"56017fec9251412296001a91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46519,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bobby E.
