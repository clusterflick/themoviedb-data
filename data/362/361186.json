The Pirates and their rallying cry of “We Are Family” brought a renewed sense of pride to the city. But as it turned out, the family was dangerously dysfunctional, with many members succumbing to the temptation of cocaine and dragging baseball into a nationwide scandal. This film revisits that era and paints a picture of how, by 1985, easy drugs and fast nights brought the national pastime from the diamond to a federal courtroom.","popularity":0.0897,"poster_path":"/r3d4fcF1UmrPKQEx3JZld6RyDoq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pittsburgh Drug Trials","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3951862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Bodley","original_name":"Hal Bodley","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64064867f48b34008572497d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3951863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Connolly","original_name":"Kevin Connolly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64064875f48b34007c855b9a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3951864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lonnie Smith","original_name":"Lonnie Smith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6406488f358da700f76ac91d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3951865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dale Shiffman","original_name":"Dale Shiffman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64064899fc31d3007c727522","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Jacobs","original_name":"Mike Jacobs","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"575d456d9251415dd200276e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5049874","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2550,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r3d4fcF1UmrPKQEx3JZld6RyDoq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
