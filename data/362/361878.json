The harshness and deprivations of life in the countryside, endured throughout the years, have hardened his smile and stiffened the look in his eyes. Alongside the road, the symphony of nature vanishes and paradise seems to exist no more. However, within a few men, tenderness and desire do not vanish, wishes and dreams are well alive and keep beating in the depth of their souls. Novena lets us witness in a documentary, fiction and pictorial style how those few men, genuinely incarnated in Juan, push their dreams forward.","popularity":0.3895,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":64410,"logo_path":null,"name":"ASFilm","origin_country":""},{"id":64411,"logo_path":null,"name":"Areachika/cine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"PY","name":"Paraguay"}],"release_date":"2010-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Guarani","iso_639_1":"gn","name":""},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Novena","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Ninth days of prayer","type":"translation"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1516218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan de Dios Collar","original_name":"Juan de Dios Collar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Juan","credit_id":"5609a72ec3a3686817000398","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1516220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teodora González","original_name":"Teodora González","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Elodia","credit_id":"5609a747c3a3686819000366","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1516221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernardino Ojeda","original_name":"Bernardino Ojeda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Evelio","credit_id":"5609a75d9251417199000337","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1516222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonifacia Ortega","original_name":"Bonifacia Ortega","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Doña Teofila","credit_id":"5609a772c3a36868170003b3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1516213,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andre Schreuders","original_name":"Andre Schreuders","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5609a680c3a368680b0003b6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1516212,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Christian Núñez","original_name":"Christian Núñez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5609a66d925141719900031d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1516215,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Luz Marina Servín","original_name":"Luz Marina Servín","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5609a6d09251417191000329","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enrique Collar","original_name":"Enrique Collar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5609a63dc3a368680b0003ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1802186","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7904,"name":"paraguay"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
