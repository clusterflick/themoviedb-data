In the beginning we see him returning to his family. Where he’s been is unknown. Wherever it was – prison, maybe war – the years have not been kind to him. In spite of his family’s warm welcome the man can’t shake an anger that builds in him so he must leave them again. This time to return to the land that was once theirs, a land that had been in the family for generations, a land that has been stolen, plundered, and sewn with seeds of greed. There’s a force at work, a corruption that destroys homes, nature, families, and memories. The Man decides to lay his stakes down and pits himself against it all. He is on a ruinous mission to sate the hatred in his heart with the knife he carries in his hand.","popularity":0.5656,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sailor Bear","origin_country":"US"},{"id":59913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beautiful Confusion Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Knife","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Baker","original_name":"Charles Baker","popularity":0.5339,"profile_path":"/mhSoY1plaop5eufoHDP4fkIGUfh.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"The Man","credit_id":"5606cb8cc3a368120b0022c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederic Doss","original_name":"Frederic Doss","popularity":0.1109,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Thug","credit_id":"5606cbbfc3a36812050021e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":988679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Socia","original_name":"Matt Socia","popularity":0.2492,"profile_path":"/9ejvtTo3dZ6HGd4KaThU5QBmzXl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Brother","credit_id":"5606cc08c3a368121b001f35","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592493,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Lowery","original_name":"David Lowery","popularity":0.352,"profile_path":"/86QPrv9y0Ienk6sqPmxz7HYqkJf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Brother-In-Law","credit_id":"5fbb78e204b59662bef60c25","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1944119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard L.
