Set to classical music by the likes of Bach, Saint-Saëns, and Shoshtakovich, and replete with rapidly mutating geometries, Bute’s filmmaking is at once formally rigorous and energetically high-spirited, like a marriage of high modernism and Merrie Melodies. In the late 1940s, Lewis Jacobs observed that Bute’s films were “composed upon mathematical formulae depicting in ever-changing lights and shadows, growing lines and forms, deepening colors and tones, the tumbling, racing impressions evoked by the musical accompaniment.” Bute herself wrote that she sought to “bring to the eyes a combination of visual forms unfolding along with the thematic development and rhythmic cadences of music.”","popularity":0.4154,"poster_path":"/l2MNhUT6zdTJ4Bk8ZSzNpNSycSQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ted Nemeth Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abstronic","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57684,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aaron Copland","original_name":"Aaron Copland","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/54sMNh45BtoNJsWv8r6rSchb8Sa.jpg","credit_id":"624c689ebdd56800a4f8dc33","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500144,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Don Gillis","original_name":"Don Gillis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624c68abd34eb300a1131dc2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1111407,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Ellen Bute","original_name":"Mary Ellen Bute","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/D9vJ1Q994vHhDlPkgFo3ifm4Go.jpg","credit_id":"560a34d092514171a0001817","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Nemeth","original_name":"Ted Nemeth","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/jXi8fwyjGpoZrF9TOT9ix0i6nLD.jpg","credit_id":"560a34e7c3a368680e001871","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0044326","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/l2MNhUT6zdTJ4Bk8ZSzNpNSycSQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":213891,"name":"abstract"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":290719,"name":"visual music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
