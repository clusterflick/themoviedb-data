The concert kicks off with a terrific set by B.B., which includes classics \"The Thrill Is Gone\" and \"Let The Good Times Roll.\"  Following B.B.'s set, James tears up the stage with some of his biggest hits. The Godfather showed he hadn't lost a step and delivered a powerhouse performance, which featured some of his dazzling footwork. He kept the audience on their feet with his raw funk and unrivaled charisma. Some of the tracks he performed in his set included \"The Payback,\" \"I Got the Feeling,\" \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World,\" and \"Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine.\"  This is the legendary show where Michael Jackson and Prince were in the audience.
