This fortress in Volterra is also backdrop for the performance of Bertolt Brecht's «Dreigroschenoper», played by the inmates themselves. These tattooed, muscle packed men exhibit a completely different side of themselves as they run around the theatre like puppies. For quite some time, it seems as if we are watching two different documentaries: one about hard prison life, and the other about frolicsome actors in eccentric plumage. But gradually the two melt together: Meanwhile, we learn more about the background. One prisoner already had a gun when he was a fourteen-year-old boy in the slums of Palermo. Another always dreamt of joining the Mafia or becoming a doctor. Now that they are all in the same boat, these former street kids have combined forces. When prisoner Nicola, condemned for murder, performs Mackie Messer, he reinvents Brecht - and himself too.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Balordi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mirjam Kubescha","original_name":"Mirjam Kubescha","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604f7069871b340028f1f17c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1555906","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Winner of the Standard Readers' Jury Award at the Viennale","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
