We travel for over one hundred years, visiting places as far flung as the Moon, Jamaica, India, Suriname, Canada, Cuba, Japan, Hungary, Iceland, Australia, Vietnam, the United States of America, encountering along the way human triumphs, technological innovations, multiple wars, societal upheavals, environmental devastation. And in the urgent here and now of the climate crisis, the film challenges us to to think about the consequences of our consumption, to reimagine the ways in which we live, and to change our material culture and political economy that is destroying the planet we all depend on.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/gNpIeLJr7RVSB4rSC9f98t2vyYb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fly Me to the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2817151,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Esther Figueroa","original_name":"Esther Figueroa","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/qZ6Zv9rWCxAqyu3OFT2nzVhfN2c.jpg","credit_id":"62b5ade3e7c097053337c41c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gNpIeLJr7RVSB4rSC9f98t2vyYb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Fly Me To The Moon Trailer - Bauxite Mining","key":"OJP2I5PcM6k","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-01-28T15:41:30.000Z","id":"6051075974507d005369e8a8"}]}}}
