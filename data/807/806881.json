It is half a tale that finally takes on the form sought by Emmer (the tale of a pigeon between two wars), and half a processual film in which we see Picasso create a mural that only exists in this film. Incontrare Picasso (Meeting Picasso) with the voice-over in the first person points towards the full expository and discursive authorship of Emmer’s two main essays: Bella di notte and Con aura…senz'aura.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/p75lOLoBiuvOrVaRS8pGp6UhhXG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Incontrare Picasso","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224311,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luciano Emmer","original_name":"Luciano Emmer","popularity":0.1361,"profile_path":"/6XKHM344N11LozL5mDVWELRu1PT.jpg","credit_id":"605207424ca6760054f81beb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/p75lOLoBiuvOrVaRS8pGp6UhhXG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
