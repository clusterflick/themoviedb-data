Defeated by life from the start, Allen finds joy and hope in hurdling, his favourite sport which he often wins in competitions during middle school. A cruel fate awaits him when he enters high school. Because of his height, his performance is suddenly hampered and he cannot even handle the basic 3-step hurdle. His hope of being in the school team is dashed, let alone winning over his teammates. The more desperately he tries, the more he realises his goal is beyond reach. Can Allen overcome this challenge before high school ends?","popularity":0.0752,"poster_path":"/iSCGvMrDtF9yc8oRe5DKAE7Wl9x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2020-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Is Not the End","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3373856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hu Jhih-ciang","original_name":"胡智強","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/7HcsGmAcWNUb1S4SNpejv7RvcTa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Yung-Mu Cheng","credit_id":"62b2bfde1b7c590549a2f4a8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2359929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Chen","original_name":"Vera Chen","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/oPX3EwNONcSsUHoOaEeieyaNS2n.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mina Wang","credit_id":"604f2bdb68929c003c1fb6f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3890287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nat Chen","original_name":"陳柏文","popularity":0.199,"profile_path":"/i3oKyDMILnAAyJWDhtBP2SzQrcK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hsiang-Yu Chiang","credit_id":"640203939653f6007c1e6312","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3011591,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kam-Hei Chan","original_name":"Kam-Hei Chan","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/536Bx1ICuJ38EX5r4qNMh615dot.jpg","credit_id":"604f2b8322e480005485c9ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27487668","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1792,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iSCGvMrDtF9yc8oRe5DKAE7Wl9x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1194}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2020-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
