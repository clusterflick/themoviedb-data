This is a nautical example of a 'phantom ride' - in which a camera is mounted on a moving vehicle - a popular genre among early filmgoers for the still-novel sensation of travel it offered. Thanks to the swelling waves, the effect when projected on a screen is rather queasier than the comparatively gentle train or tram journeys that were more typical phantom ride subjects. Waves on Bow of a Ship was made by Warwick Trading Company, a leading British film production and distribution company between 1898-1915.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5jyG1cTP6UfzM1OMG3wBqA1SPLB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1900-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waves Break on Bow of a Ship","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5jyG1cTP6UfzM1OMG3wBqA1SPLB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
