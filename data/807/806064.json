The workaday humdrum... drones to the hive. So I take to the streets, with my homemade Bolex robot, affectionately known as \"BOLBOT.\" It is a time-lapse motion control machine capable of smoothly spinning through X-Y-Z axes continuously or in a stop/go pattern. The resulting footage is a transformed view of the city; urban scenes are in a continual state of exaggerated movement. A main idea of this film is to take mediated views of everyday city scenery and to elevate the city to a frenzied cosmic rendering with orb-like symmetries abounding. The city, and nature are transformed into a seething and pulsing mandala. The hope is that the spectator experiences meditative, trancelike states.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4K9QVUQtX0BYaTtuDj0kcanecQi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Axis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2845413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Kneller","original_name":"John Kneller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604ee4746517d6003ff41a98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4K9QVUQtX0BYaTtuDj0kcanecQi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
