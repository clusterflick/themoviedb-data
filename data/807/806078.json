This tape takes an irreverent look at the stereotyping that surrounds body hair for women. It mixes historical research, a little personal testimony, ad-copy, and the voices of “hair experts” to create an informed analysis. Body Hair closes, in time-honoured feminist documentary style, with a radical call to action.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/t2ZCEXEmXpEQivnJC2AIatNu2Nn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Body Hair","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3011490,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carla Wolf","original_name":"Carla Wolf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604ef1e568929c0073179038","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t2ZCEXEmXpEQivnJC2AIatNu2Nn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
