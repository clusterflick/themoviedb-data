Too hot for PBS, but prime time TV everywhere else. Do the World Bank and IMF make the poor even poorer? Are the Bank and IMF democratic institutions? Why do people demonstrate against the Bank and IMF? For the first time, a documentary global investigation of major criticisms of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), two of the most powerful financial institutions in the world. Five country case studies are presented, each concentrating on a different aspect of critics' charges: 1. Bolivia: Debt, Drugs and Democracy 2. Ghana: The Model of Success 3. Brazil: Debt, Damage and Politics 4. Thailand: Dams and Dislocation 5. Philippines: The Debt Fighters. The charges, including those related to structural adjustment, are controversial and provocative. Some go to the heart of the power and policies of these institutions.","popularity":0.5556,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Money Lenders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1136361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Richter","original_name":"Robert Richter","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/oC9BnfRndgapiwWhTNDMo7UYJty.jpg","credit_id":"6701cb9fb146282f7b8572ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1641836","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3228,"name":"bolivia"},{"id":3434,"name":"thailand"},{"id":6895,"name":"philippines"},{"id":165193,"name":"financial crisis"},{"id":207458,"name":"national debt"},{"id":209509,"name":"ghana"},{"id":264118,"name":"brazil"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
