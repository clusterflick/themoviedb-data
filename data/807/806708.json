Who are they and what connects them? As the narrative progresses we learn that something has happened. There's been an event, something that has changed everything. But when did it happen... and where? There are suggestions; talk of bankers bonuses and bombs but nothing is specified. Has it happened? Will it happen? Then we see that the subjects of the narrative are from dedications on memorial park benches that are very real; covered in moss and graffiti, heightening the confusion between what is real and what is not. Monument appears as a low budget doc about park benches but its narrative poses powerful questions about memory, memorial and the way of things...","popularity":0.3355,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monument","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Therese Bradley","original_name":"Therese Bradley","popularity":0.5058,"profile_path":"/rkzXK3dRUd9n22RZHC22E130ieq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60512f8d6dc6c000546607ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3013365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Chamberlain","original_name":"Christopher Chamberlain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60512f9a2cde980053cbd7d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3013366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Cowan","original_name":"Annie Cowan","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60512fa57314a10040f71403","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3013367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Dix","original_name":"Sophie Dix","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60512fb28c7b0f003c343465","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3013368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Kerrigan","original_name":"Jonathan Kerrigan","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60512fc0976a23003d87b6b7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3013369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Richmond","original_name":"Laura Richmond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60512fcb41a561007360e7b0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3013370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Rodriguez","original_name":"Carmen Rodriguez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60512fd841a561003dbe7504","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3013371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Rodriguez","original_name":"Carmen Rodriguez","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60512fefc072a2005313e5c3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3013372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Thorn","original_name":"Rebecca Thorn","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60512ffb7314a1002b20f21a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3013373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Wright","original_name":"Christopher Wright","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"605130056517d6003ff6f2c1","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3013362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duncan Pickstock","original_name":"Duncan Pickstock","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6051301f197de4006bb32057","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3013362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duncan Pickstock","original_name":"Duncan Pickstock","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6051302b22e480003c25a447","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
