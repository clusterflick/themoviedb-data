A gold disk containing coded information was on board. On the disk were recorded greetings and invitation to visit the Earth in all languages of our world. The film tells the story of an alien ALIE by name who responded to the invitation from inhabitants of the Earth. Gravity that confined ALIE to a wheelchair, people around him, who don't understand each other, homesickness. That's not all the problems the hero faced being among people. The moment he meets his love seems to lose touch with reality. But he finds the path to himself.","popularity":0.0902,"poster_path":"/pOSiaFg3uk2UsxUCJwnuhCQ7Zk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152234,"logo_path":"/2Xf1skjenjpJewvXPRipXD0rgWn.png","name":"VAVILON","origin_country":"UA"},{"id":131386,"logo_path":"/7hbMW4N2YRj15Ytk4wCjpJ9WRWw.png","name":"Ministry of Culture of Ukraine","origin_country":"UA"},{"id":61460,"logo_path":"/3yPCkEWvnabeiF8l3sjUBHlRq0j.png","name":"Ukrainian State Film Agency","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2020-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ALIE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2788437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmytro Korshak","original_name":"Dmytro Korshak","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/9QMl9LLgYRgsfYBMbMIrwZ2ogs1.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63edf048699fb7009e3e3190","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3922821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olena Meshcheriakova","original_name":"Olena Meshcheriakova","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/tNCj5Lge8MUGpnHicSb6f7nUGUp.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63edf1861f3e6000c03372c6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2421906,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Natalya Blok","original_name":"Natalya Blok","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604f736368929c003c1fe88d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3006533,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrii Rizol","original_name":"Andrii Rizol","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ud5MJgcbM2zrL0vTCbaueLJmGNc.jpg","credit_id":"604f738a976a230074764302","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kadim Tarasov","original_name":"Kadim Tarasov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604f73ce1d820f00529b933d","department":"Writing","job":"Creative Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3011767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Romaniuk","original_name":"Victor Romaniuk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604f732d2cefc2002855cf5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3011769,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alina Krasnianska","original_name":"Alina Krasnianska","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604f73b86517d6006a208073","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kadim Tarasov","original_name":"Kadim Tarasov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604f73476517d60029237a96","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3011768,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sviatoslav Rizol","original_name":"Sviatoslav Rizol","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604f73a2ae2811006bd4b70a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2788434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kadim Tarasov","original_name":"Kadim Tarasov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63edf270699fb70084e25f65","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14243430","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2N5ec1x6rIZCF9CSqeE9w4oo2Od.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1405,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/gWGgxqDjD9ULyxyroQpJR01IZ9k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pOSiaFg3uk2UsxUCJwnuhCQ7Zk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":571}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
