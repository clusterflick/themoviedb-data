The incident was that a woman broke through her belly and had an umbilical cord popping out of her belly, and at the same time three men were said to have blew bubbles from their mouths and died.  One day, Shinya's wife, Junko, receives something called Baby Mail. The baby mail says, \"I have a grudge against someone who is trying to have a child. I will raise my child.\" When she opens the attached file \"@\", the baby cried and the LCD of her cell phone cracked, which was creepy. A month later, she was found in a condition similar to the bizarre incident. However, she was diagnosed as four months pregnant when her body was found, even though she had her period a month ago.","popularity":0.3661,"poster_path":"/kKu1JA7otnnzOa9C0JgP6p6hL4E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2005-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"@Babymail","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"@beibîmêru","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27786,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kōji Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木光司","popularity":0.4056,"profile_path":"/jkL3dmRLZlAvDnzIZymI8MMg5Sr.jpg","credit_id":"604f9868031deb0054e3ac7e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150779,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yusuke Yamada","original_name":"山田悠介","popularity":0.1507,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604f98724ca6760054f4eff0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshihiro Nakamura","original_name":"中村義洋","popularity":0.475,"profile_path":"/pQvOhnjNx1fUnDmGCkgrPDoflXV.jpg","credit_id":"604f984e848eb9003c36c85c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0768097","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1387,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kKu1JA7otnnzOa9C0JgP6p6hL4E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":974}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
