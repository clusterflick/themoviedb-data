The film is a form of visual diary, taking the viewers on a journey of realizations regarding the filmmaker's difficult family relations, gender and sexual identity, and lack of control. It reflects on shame, guilt, and the experience of queerness in a conservative, Catholic setting, as well as on the concepts of migration and re-rooting. The filmmaker uses this deeply personal and moving film to reflect on whether it's possible to fully accept one's fate.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/tBQrkt4VSMicfGiBUfTaPDW5lTz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"42 Days","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2104269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nat Portnoy","original_name":"Nat Portnoy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6051b00a74507d00536aefb2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.748,"height":922,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tBQrkt4VSMicfGiBUfTaPDW5lTz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":690}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Burnt Video Art and Experimental Film Festival","release_date":"2021-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
