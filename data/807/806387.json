There's certainly a gale, and a wrecked ship, but the one didn't cause the other. This early film records a brutal storm with a close view of waves crashing over a wreck - an empty, broken ship that had beached some time before. Still, the wreck gives a sense of scale to the ferocity of the weather, and is a stark reminder of the damage that a gale can do.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1900-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Wreck in a Gale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
