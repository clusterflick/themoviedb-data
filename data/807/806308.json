Tano D'Amico thus began a journey that would lead him to be at the forefront of the social battles of the 1970s: the birth of new movements, \"the appearance on the threshold of history of a people who had never entered history\", the hopes, illusions and betrayals. Tano still continues to photograph workers, the homeless, migrants, the last people and all those who take protest to the streets.","popularity":0.3259,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
