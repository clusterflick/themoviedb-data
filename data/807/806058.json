The Turtle see a preview of \"The Shaman King\" before setting out to find parts of the code. They are joined by Cubix, Kid Muscle, Kirby, and Sonic the Hedgehog. Can the good guys along with 1,000,000 viewers watching this special stop the bad guys and save their Saturday Morning block? Or will the villains be victorious for once?
