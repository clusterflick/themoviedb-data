During a party, Sammy assigns unusual significance to it, while Rose juggles preparations amid distractions. The unexpected arrival of Helen, who claims residence there, oscillates between confusion and lucidity. Strangely, Helen possesses intimate knowledge of the house and its guests: an Ingenue, a director, and Rose's former flame.

change.","popularity":2.6115,"poster_path":"/qca6vdh8Rg2Kc9kFTcSeEpAgWlI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":223250,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rosebud
