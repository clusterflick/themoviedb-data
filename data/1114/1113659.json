More than 50 thoroughbred racecars, including more than 30 in the new Group C category, set off for almost 3,000 miles of fascinating competition at the Circuit de la Sarthe, with speeds along the infamous Mulsanne straight topping 230mph.  Le Mans legends Jacky Ickx and Derek Bell once again led the Porsche attack, with the Belgian legend chasing a sixth Le Mans. After seeing off the challenge from the Rondeau machines, the race for victory became a straight fight between the three works Porsche 956s.","popularity":0.0412,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 1982","title":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 1982","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
