More than 50 thoroughbred racecars set off for almost 3,000 miles of fascinating competition at the Circuit de la Sarthe, with speeds along the infamous Mulsanne straight topping 230mph.  Le Mans legends Jacky Ickx and Derek Bell would lead the Porsche charge in the amazing works 936, but, as always, the 24 Hours Race had attracted an incredibly high quality of entry.  Drivers like Hans Joachim Stuck, Jochen Mass, Hurley Haywood, Eddie Cheever, Jean Rondeau, Bob Wolleck and more would be among those bidding to prevent Ickx taking a remarkable fifth Le Mans win.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 1981","title":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 1981","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
