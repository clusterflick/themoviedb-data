The first film made in the Philippines to feature optically recorded sound was George Musser's Ang Aswang (The Vampire). In 1932, Musser imported 50,000 PHP worth of optical sound equipment and turned his house into a studio. He spent a year shooting the film with Charles Miller as his cinematographer and William Smith as his soundman. Despite its Tagalog title, the film was actually recorded in Spanish and English. The film opened to acclaim at the Lyric on January 1, 1933, then at the Tivoli on January 4. Unfortunately, according to some observers, the sound was sometimes out of sync and inaudible.","popularity":0.0689,"poster_path":"/jD8TFfa9AntkRCWigE8AAdg6MQt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aswang 1933","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","title":"The Vampire","type":"Direct translation"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khavn","original_name":"Khavn","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/m9vSp0TVkjkiWr8qiiO8sInAYv3.jpg","credit_id":"643be7e9da10f01bff64bd83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5070782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Musser","original_name":"George Musser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676dfa5caa8f3159d612a971","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khavn","original_name":"Khavn","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/m9vSp0TVkjkiWr8qiiO8sInAYv3.jpg","credit_id":"676dfa632c9097b266614d84","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khavn","original_name":"Khavn","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/m9vSp0TVkjkiWr8qiiO8sInAYv3.jpg","credit_id":"676dfa6a769852f290129aa3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jD8TFfa9AntkRCWigE8AAdg6MQt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
