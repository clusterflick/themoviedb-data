Take a look as he works in his atelier, preps for exhibitions, and speaks at lectures. The simple, warm and gentle figures carved out by Funakoshi can be attributed to the harmony of precise calculations and accidental occurrences. His human-like sculptures draw in beholders with their distant marble gaze as if pondering philosophical thoughts and projecting subtle yet bold emotions.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fdtYoGLxNqnESDnM79C67OYl7kl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Katsura Funakoshi: Whispering Gaze","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Near Equal Funakoshi Katsura","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Funakoshi Katsura: Katarikakeru manazashi","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1569467","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fdtYoGLxNqnESDnM79C67OYl7kl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
