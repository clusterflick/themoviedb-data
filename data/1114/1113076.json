Men don’t know how to be a man anymore. Some are comfortable being effeminate, but many are looking for guides like Jordan Peterson and Jocko Willink. They get angry because ‘I won’t be able to have what my father, what my grandfather had.’ That rage is not going to fix anything. Yeah, you had a bad deal, and these things aren’t all your fault, but you’re still responsible for your response to the time that God has put you in. It’s your job to stop being a victim even if you’ve been victimized.","popularity":0.2095,"poster_path":"/tuIblxF1P64kHX8nihBVkG26h9w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's Good To Be A Man: A Map to Manhood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3339752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Foster","original_name":"Michael Foster","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"643973c7202e110102cb67ee","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3833399,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Kohl","original_name":"Brian Kohl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64397397202e110102cb67dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3833401,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Engerbretson","original_name":"James Engerbretson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643973a696670e0111d3d0c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tuIblxF1P64kHX8nihBVkG26h9w.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9pH4xCH9IbUKtCmyUMShV3J6zqB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":225172,"name":"manhood"},{"id":258703,"name":"christian"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
