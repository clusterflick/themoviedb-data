Set in California, the story explores the cult-like nature of the beauty industry — as well as 'the danger of internalizing its pitiless gaze.' Set to be published in September this year by Simon & Schuster/Marysue Rucci Books, Rouge is the latest novel from [Mona] Awad, behind All’s Well, 13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl and Bunny, which was listed among the best book of 2019 by Time, Vogue and the New York Public Library.\" (THR)","popularity":0.3378,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":121813,"logo_path":"/7OwtRpQAFKU3KWA7InBg3h3PxqI.png","name":"Fremantle","origin_country":"US"},{"id":197828,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sinestra","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Rouge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3976752,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mona Awad","original_name":"Mona Awad","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/y7PraepYtBqe5YJ0Gd2TIW7OYUs.jpg","credit_id":"64399d587ef38104f8626d8a","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Renck","original_name":"Johan Renck","popularity":0.4086,"profile_path":"/pkPO6RhVFcKDiEUtbHjTkq4JjYi.jpg","credit_id":"6439ab622938350479a99b55","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4010674,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Parets","original_name":"Michael Parets","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6439ab91be4b36048735f20a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"},{"id":9872,"name":"grief"},{"id":15032,"name":"gothic horror"},{"id":33505,"name":"gothic"},{"id":157213,"name":"death of mother"},{"id":210586,"name":"dark fairy tale"},{"id":240266,"name":"beauty industry"},{"id":259094,"name":"dark"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
