The original \"voice of god\" style sound-track is recut to match the ridicule of the censored images, as well as to expose its own white colonial centricity and superiority. William Castle is introducing the film himself, and he concludes the piece with a reaction of the audience. Some special effects from the frame by frame transfer from film to video, are inserted as an extra reminder of the plasticity of media and their sometimes shady content (then and now).\" - Gerda Cammaer","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skindrums and Tattoos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerda Cammaer","original_name":"Gerda Cammaer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643a9c2b091e62047b5e2803","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
