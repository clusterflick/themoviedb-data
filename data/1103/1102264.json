The Guerra family breaks up when Joaquín abandons his wife Mónica and his three children. But that same day, Arturo and Teo Salvador, a father and his son who have lived alone since the death of their mother, arrive at the neighboring house. Thus begins a confrontation between two opposing paternity models: the tender and present father, against the one who renounces and forgets. But how and why do these families look for each other, or get lost, or find each other without knowing that they have been lost? An innocent prayer on the mountain will trigger danger, illusion, laughter, fear and the conquest of these boys alone in a forest of questions, violence, but also mercy.","popularity":0.064,"poster_path":"/lZApegmKunILSsy227ZESVYkNno.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105019,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tamto Producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":105018,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radio HCJB Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Contigo voy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3969884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Williams Arauz","original_name":"Williams Arauz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6417ad362b8a4300f68e39b5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":593070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Baumann","original_name":"Christoph Baumann","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":"/mUjy37Yim97vj38iYcw02NA0veG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6417ad535690b500a217c41d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2051849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jashua Fiallos","original_name":"Jashua Fiallos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6417ad7b3103250086f8b308","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3969885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce Fiallos","original_name":"Joyce Fiallos","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6417ad955690b500d401799d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3969886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keren Gregorich","original_name":"Keren Gregorich","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6417adad9ee0ef00d72d2202","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3969887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santiago Gómez","original_name":"Santiago Gómez","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6417addb2b8a4300b8d4fc26","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3969888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathy Miño","original_name":"Kathy Miño","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6417adef9ee0ef00d72d2236","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3969889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Tamayo","original_name":"Antonio Tamayo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6417ae0a3103250086f8b389","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3969890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrés Vásconez","original_name":"Andrés Vásconez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6417ae2a2b8a4300b8d4fc6e","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2051845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco de la Torre","original_name":"Marco de la Torre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6417ad035690b500bb01e3e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3969883,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Aurelia del Nero","original_name":"Aurelia del Nero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6417ad1ee9c0dc00ecc9c4ab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23749198","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lZApegmKunILSsy227ZESVYkNno.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":902}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"CONTIGO VOY (Pelicula Ecuatoriana) Trailer 1","key":"LEHE5n2IED0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-01-16T03:31:51.000Z","id":"6417ac810d5d85009ba24416"}]}}}
