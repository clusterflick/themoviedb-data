It is the heroic story of how Pittsburgh, once plagued by industrial pollution and urban blight, was transformed in just 40 years to what it is today. It is a story told by people who were intimately involved in its change - scientists, politicians, teachers, construction workers, business and community leaders.  Unique archival footage dramatically portrays Pittsburgh's past; stunning photography captures the city today - from its hills, bridges and rivers to the medical, educational and artistic communities in its mosaic of neighborhoods. This is Pittsburgh, a place whose people take pride in their heritage and in their ever-changing home. THE SPIRIT OF PITTSBURGH was commissioned by The Pittsburgh Foundation of Dollar Bank. Look for this remarkable film at its permanent home in the Renaissance Theatre of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center.","popularity":0.3239,"poster_path":"/19snvFrdKM8aMDB5XgtsnZOpAq5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16021,"logo_path":"/2bjAiWiyI4nUWzxLcnGejDO0amC.png","name":"WQED","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A new film celebrating the transformation of a city","title":"The Spirit of Pittsburgh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritz Weaver","original_name":"Fritz Weaver","popularity":0.4751,"profile_path":"/gjudPIeWyMJaxDvkRgx0HoTf2zG.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6418619c5690b500bb0258ba","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3970425,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Argentine","original_name":"Peter Argentine","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6418609b6a2227008de8bc6e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3810620,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gary Hines","original_name":"Gary Hines","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641860bfe74146007c82e631","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2485143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norris Brock","original_name":"Norris Brock","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6418613b310325010151a3ac","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3970425,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Argentine","original_name":"Peter Argentine","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641860a4e74146007c82e623","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168307,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mark Knobil","original_name":"Mark Knobil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6418615be74146007c82e67b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1029005,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas Skinner","original_name":"Thomas Skinner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641861732b8a4300f68eaeb9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2354,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/19snvFrdKM8aMDB5XgtsnZOpAq5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1570}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":193594,"name":"pittsburgh, pennsylvania"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
