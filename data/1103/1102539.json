Armed with a pair of binoculars and several bottles of bourbon, she passes the time watching Tom and Katherine Royce, the glamorous couple living in the house across the lake. They make for good viewing—a tech innovator, Tom is powerful; and a former model, Katherine is gorgeous. One day on the lake, Casey saves Katherine from drowning, and the two strike up a budding friendship. But the more they get to know each other—and the longer Casey watches—it becomes clear that Katherine and Tom’s marriage isn’t as perfect as it appears. When Katherine suddenly vanishes, Casey immediately suspects Tom of foul play. What she doesn’t realize is that there’s more to the story than meets the eye—and that shocking secrets can lurk beneath the most placid of surfaces.","popularity":0.9593,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":27711,"logo_path":"/3e294jszfE6cE8TOogmj0zNd6pL.png","name":"Berlanti Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":61791,"logo_path":"/xyiy5wZdmnxVViRa8oRMXQQvT6F.png","name":"Feigco Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The House Across the Lake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3682168,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Riley Sager","original_name":"Riley Sager","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6418a3a92b8a4300d794f7a1","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Feig","original_name":"Paul Feig","popularity":0.6857,"profile_path":"/mE3eFY3gq1UQ7Rj2He2YbZ7PFya.jpg","credit_id":"6418a3bae7414600f7ef5758","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1395152,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarah Schechter","original_name":"Sarah Schechter","popularity":0.3062,"profile_path":"/8UgL2O24cC8SniiryeYmZuafU4G.jpg","credit_id":"6418a4016a22270085f0eae8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88967,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Greg Berlanti","original_name":"Greg Berlanti","popularity":0.603,"profile_path":"/1T24SiIIDMa9gAmq7QaYwZywq4y.jpg","credit_id":"6418a40ce74146008672ccdc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2131196,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael McGrath","original_name":"Michael McGrath","popularity":0.1133,"profile_path":"/lWbcy9Quc3ODgQvHVBM9EElHS8g.jpg","credit_id":"6418a41ca14bef00b8151612","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27192871","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"},{"id":4129,"name":"widow"},{"id":156799,"name":"vermont"},{"id":178649,"name":"voyeurism"},{"id":254618,"name":"lakehouse"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
