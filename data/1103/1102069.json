With a bitter undertone to it, Soosaar shows how, to this view, a lack of possibilities for self-government and the conceited attitude of the mainland towards the islanders have caused great problems to this society. The island has been negligently placed under far too large a kolkhoz. Enormous alcoholism is prevalent among the male population and, increasingly, among the women. Sheer possession of money has become a standard of regard. If a family cannot spare 4,000 roubles for the marriage of their children, they are ignored by the other islanders. In this dramatic as well as poetic documentary we see how the social awareness of a society has gone by the board. Merely concrete and strict reformations can improve the situation the island is in.","popularity":0.078,"poster_path":"/gJIPC0uhleHZoubz1877c5pxzQU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6147,"logo_path":"/ygdtYCejdFLfMWht1M8XOwuM3Sj.png","name":"Tallinnfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1986-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man of Kihnu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Männen på Kihnu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152385,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mart Kessel-Otsa","original_name":"Mart Kessel-Otsa","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/c6MTdLFTfp8KEQrlipVVNIIqVrF.jpg","credit_id":"64171fee6a222700e975b623","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1945438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark-Toomas Soosaar","original_name":"Mark-Toomas Soosaar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1k2EiWdCTnesD3Tahf3z8LdjlQb.jpg","credit_id":"64171f29e9c0dc007b99d018","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1945438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark-Toomas Soosaar","original_name":"Mark-Toomas Soosaar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1k2EiWdCTnesD3Tahf3z8LdjlQb.jpg","credit_id":"64171f343103250086f8869c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3969298,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Janika Freidkes","original_name":"Janika Freidkes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64171faee9c0dc007b99d077","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3969299,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alar Neiland","original_name":"Alar Neiland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64171fbe31032500e8a23bab","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3969303,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Märt Müür","original_name":"Märt Müür","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6417202f5690b50084e05c68","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3129765,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eha Meier","original_name":"Eha Meier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64171f43310325008efd15ba","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3969302,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sulev Saar","original_name":"Sulev Saar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64171fe00d5d8500838710c9","department":"Production","job":"Administration"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1945438,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark-Toomas Soosaar","original_name":"Mark-Toomas Soosaar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1k2EiWdCTnesD3Tahf3z8LdjlQb.jpg","credit_id":"64171f1d5690b500bb01b910","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3969301,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mihkel Sutt","original_name":"Mihkel Sutt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64171fd3e9c0dc008f714ec3","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1545901,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ike Volkov","original_name":"Ike Volkov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6417200531032500e8a23bd1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"et","file_path":"/gJIPC0uhleHZoubz1877c5pxzQU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7464,"name":"alcoholism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tallinn","release_date":"1986-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
