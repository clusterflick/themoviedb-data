This version also includes a prologue cameo featuring Kathy Coleman and Wesley Eure, who played siblings Will and Holly in the original “Land of the Lost” TV series from the 1970s. The duo wasn’t able to travel to Portland but filmed a scene to be edited into the project. Many of the local cast and extras are members of Weird Portland United, a nonprofit collective of the city’s self-proclaimed weird artists.","popularity":0.1992,"poster_path":"/hTbJcrdsJtXObpFDN7syhoRrSRQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sleestak's Big Adventure","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1229712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathy Coleman","original_name":"Kathy Coleman","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6418a63c2b8a4300b8d57e8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":214068,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wesley Eure","original_name":"Wesley Eure","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/7Mamyx7AY2bBVanZcyTdlPsMIGS.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6418a6465690b5007a559426","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3970780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Blake Olson","original_name":"Blake Olson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6418a545e7414600b96bf320","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3970782,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brent Marr","original_name":"Brent Marr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6418a5655690b501016335e2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3970783,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Travis Stanton-Flowers","original_name":"Travis Stanton-Flowers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6418a57c6a22270085f0eb28","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3970780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Blake Olson","original_name":"Blake Olson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6418a5846a2227008de8d2e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3970783,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Travis Stanton-Flowers","original_name":"Travis Stanton-Flowers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6418a5976a222700e97669de","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hTbJcrdsJtXObpFDN7syhoRrSRQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
