Being Earnest takes place in a mod, 1960’s, Austin Powers-era setting. All of the brilliant wit in Wilde’s most popular play intact in this effervescent musical about two young couples and the societal conventions, over-bearing mothers, and misplaced handbags in railway stations that they must overcome in the course of finding true love. The score is a sparkling homage to 1960’s rock groups such as Herman’s Hermits, The Dave Clark Five, The Rolling Stones, The Seekers, The Hollies, The Lovin’ Spoonful and more.","popularity":0.3209,"poster_path":"/5fipVoEwAnOkhhhfaVToy2XF3Yc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196221,"logo_path":null,"name":"Skylight Music Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Being Earnest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3972104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Pink","original_name":"Max Pink","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Algernon","credit_id":"6419b6d3e7414600b96c8284","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3972108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Rebers","original_name":"Tim Rebers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lane / Dr Chasuble / Merriman","credit_id":"6419b706e7414600f7efe42d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3972111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joey Chelius","original_name":"Joey Chelius","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jack","credit_id":"6419b7156a2227010c4cfa2a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3972112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Marinan","original_name":"Nathan Marinan","popularity":0.0501,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lady Bracknell","credit_id":"6419b725e741460082183db7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3972115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Staszak","original_name":"Stephanie Staszak","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Gwendolyn","credit_id":"6419b74ce74146008673599b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3972120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Estrada","original_name":"Karen Estrada","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Miss Prism","credit_id":"6419b7706a2227007d745a3e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3972123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Oveido","original_name":"Ashley Oveido","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Cecily","credit_id":"6419b783e74146007c8379e8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2936736,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Barbara Gruska","original_name":"Barbara Gruska","popularity":0.0665,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"Additional Vocals","credit_id":"6419b9cbe004a600e29fea71","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3972155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethan Gruska","original_name":"Ethan Gruska","popularity":0.1215,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":25,"character":"Additional Vocals","credit_id":"6419b9d9e004a600b8a673f6","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3972128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Unger","original_name":"Michael Unger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6419b7a63103250086f9b156","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3972146,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jack R.
