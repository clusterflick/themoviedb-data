When rabbits and foxes play a role in the airport's ecosystem and are protected by scientists, others could be a threat to aircraft safety. This is the story of Goupil, the airport's official fox and rabbit controller. With a hundred of his fellow foxes, he is in charge of controlling the 20,000 rabbits that invade the airport's lawn and sometimes get sucked into the engines, thus endangering the planes and their passengers. Given that each female rabbit can give birth to 1848 young rabbits during her 9 years of life, Goupil fears neither famine nor unemployment. But many other animals threaten the safety of the planes: birds of various sizes and species, sedentary or migratory, bats, and even hares and boars. Will Goupil manage to accomplish his mission?","popularity":0.0951,"poster_path":"/v0Zt7EH486OfW3VhNhVj78BgCat.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Airport Animal Stories","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2253514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Charle","original_name":"Samuel Charle","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/2or2C6JLgGYVeJtFehIpjDkkDsw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"648f30bbc2ff3d0139aebfd1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3674965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marie-Hélène Baconnet","original_name":"Marie-Hélène Baconnet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6418bfaba14bef0081007853","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26770708","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kCdlYTqsPI0Q3gRSAlBvNyYutPm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1332,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v0Zt7EH486OfW3VhNhVj78BgCat.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":888}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
