The village life is all centered around the local bar and for the men, the days go by drinking and kidding one another until one night, the statues that decorate the village square get vandalized. The blame goes on Corvaz. While the grudge from the community rises, a punishing expedition eventually forces Corvaz to face the villagers and leave. For the others, there may be no such an alternative. The code of “rispet” that has kept them all together is now broken.","popularity":0.1854,"poster_path":"/oYDsQhD6yLO1sck1QfsRcMJSt9K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96786,"logo_path":"/8LoW4RoenaXpaVGyGCZPZvRa4P8.png","name":"Stefilm","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":12340,"logo_path":"/2tgY95Di4hQhR4JUkejJWx2sN2z.png","name":"ma.ja.de.
