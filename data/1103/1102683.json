When the truth-seeking reporter begins to gain notoriety on back page blogs for his journalistic integrity, an off-the-books FBI-SDPD joint task force discovers that he could be their key to uncovering a case of corruption and by a subsequent quick stroke of luck, Eddie literally collides into the woman of his dreams, and finds that she could become his key to breaking out back into the mainstream. But Eddie soon finds himself in over his head, when the case of corruption converges into his personal life and he's forced to make the ultimate choice--sacrifice his values...or everything else.","popularity":0.1082,"poster_path":"/3OcZOsuoej0uUIbZrtl4gv54IR7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last
