Dorothy Towers frames the buildings in a continuum of history that extends back to the city's postwar redevelopment via its modernist underpasses and nightclubs. The film opens a space to reflect on the complex relationship between architecture, community and memory.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xRBWSR4XSubELHZSXGqJKJPXahQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dorothy Towers","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3969079,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean Burns","original_name":"Sean Burns","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6416f9213103250086f879e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3969080,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kim McAleese","original_name":"Kim McAleese","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6416f9326a2227008de81790","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2127887,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Neil Hillman","original_name":"Neil Hillman","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641af205688cd0010c5f7e15","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3797185,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chris Keenan","original_name":"Chris Keenan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641af1cba3e4ba00830b022f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3969079,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean Burns","original_name":"Sean Burns","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641af0f795c0af00c5aec395","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3974172,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eleanor Jones","original_name":"Eleanor Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641af1e2a3e4ba00f6e7d400","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26765584","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1391,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xRBWSR4XSubELHZSXGqJKJPXahQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":928}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
