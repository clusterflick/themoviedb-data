It's the closing months of the war in occupied Holland and some women unravel a beautiful bedspread in order to knit 55 socks to barter for food. Reaching back into his childhood memories, Hoedeman has made a simple, poetic film of rare beauty.","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"55 Socks","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Co Hoedeman","original_name":"Co Hoedeman","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/y9G2oaPIpDJ1V016vqdWeHGGQGH.jpg","credit_id":"55a996599251411e11004278","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3975528","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
