Director Nicole Ma spent more than a decade documenting Putuparri's journey, travelling with him and his family on numerous occasions to Kurtal, in the Kimberley's Great Sandy Desert region – traditionally a site of great significance as a place where people ritually make rain – as they fight for their native title claim over the area.  Set against the backdrop of this long fight for ownership of traditional lands, the MIFF Premiere Fund-supported Putuparri and the Rainmakers is an emotional, visually breathtaking story of love, hope and the survival of Aboriginal law and culture against all odds.","popularity":0.0905,"poster_path":"/sDeDfLfhIYW672IRViaKHm4YEns.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20422,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sensible Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Putuparri and the Rainmakers","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1487885,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicole Ma","original_name":"Nicole Ma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55a861989251411e0f002b61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5098418,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Elliot","original_name":"Paul Elliot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675047d544847e97dff409e9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1487885,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicole Ma","original_name":"Nicole Ma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67504886b666830b6e43e793","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4847090","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gPQc03jv1fn0hCaDyiQhUCfo9Mc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":824,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8e3eXUsg9zaP7n2K6bZLJH8weQW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1467}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sDeDfLfhIYW672IRViaKHm4YEns.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eITuVbORQ65V7XQSxOxNXBOlzh8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
