Nowhere on Earth is hit worse than the Korean peninsula. Ha-jin, a sly, savvy orphan, prowls the rubble of a broken, barely functioning Busan wracked by daily tremors. Her petty crimes land her in jail, and from there the clutches of human traffickers — and finally far out to sea, rescued (or rather, kidnapped?) by a ragtag band of pirates seeking the precious crystals at the heart of a volcanic island. To reach their prize, they’ll need to defeat the island’s fearsome guardian, the legendary volcano whale. And to do that, they’ll need Ha-jin’s special talent for summoning whales. But is her rare power a blessing, or a curse?","popularity":0.0811,"poster_path":"/2vfqxeDBLJZaf4uzVF977Qbg3ZI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2014-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Crimson Whale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Hwasan Golae","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Hwasangorae","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1488049,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Park Hye-mi","original_name":"Park Hye-mi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55a953cb92514125da00378f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1488049,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Park Hye-mi","original_name":"Park Hye-mi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55a953c49251411e0b003c58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4839348","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2vfqxeDBLJZaf4uzVF977Qbg3ZI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":837}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
