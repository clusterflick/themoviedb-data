It tells the tale of the life and loves of one peculiar poet. In 1932, Bon-wwong returned from studying fine arts in Japan. He is known as a painter of the Fauvism school of the Art. At the first successful exhibition of his works, he meets a young man, Lee Sang, a poet with really queer character. Soon Lee Sang and Bon-woong become close friends, and they meet almost every day and enjoy all kinds of interesting and usual events. Lee Sang goes to visit Bakchon (a health resort) for medical treatment. Bon-woong follow him. At Bakchon, Lee and Bon-woong meet Keum-hong (a famous waitress) and both fall in love with her. Lee loves Keum-hong physically, vulgarly, and indecently. On the contrary, Bon-woong loves her spiritually and platonically with respect. So, he can do nothing but watch the torrid love affair between Lee and Keum-hong.","popularity":0.7335,"poster_path":"/9Ylxn4S4pcvQKKebgyTGmHBgO2w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16505,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taehung Pictures","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"1995-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is the true story of the Fauvist painter Bon-woong and Lee Sang, the poet and writer.","title":"My Dear Keum-hong","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Keum-honga Keum-honga","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"My Dear Geum Hong","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1222431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Kap-soo","original_name":"김갑수","popularity":0.8702,"profile_path":"/u5Y4oC2qKPD2Xsw5JsC8vHQRo8s.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lee Sang","credit_id":"5ebd0b671283e9001fcad662","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":231505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Ji-eun","original_name":"이지은","popularity":0.1341,"profile_path":"/MG1TeJnqhGAd602yCNAzNzx8vF.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Keum-hong","credit_id":"5f0aa8b41f98d100381ad433","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1903218,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kim Su-cheol","original_name":"김수철","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":"/xvjjKWdHLFCcPaccWlI5jfp1QnT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Goo Bon-woong","credit_id":"5f0aa84df48b340034fdfe97","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoon Jung-bin","original_name":"Yoon Jung-bin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Byeon Dong-rim","credit_id":"5ebd0b8d076ce80021764885","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Woo-ran","original_name":"Kim Woo-ran","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Choi Kyeong-ja","credit_id":"5ebd0b991283e9001ecbb8d1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park Ji-il","original_name":"박지일","popularity":0.3582,"profile_path":"/lQRlAAR7FFwb7ieNtbj4OZcK6uh.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Kim Gi-rim","credit_id":"5ebd0ba68586780021e4520d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Yoo-jin","original_name":"김유진","popularity":0.3258,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55b4b6439251411e0f01435b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4727448,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yi Sang","original_name":"이상","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/s8HEFHCGG3QEcZYHDGTcrb0gXh2.jpg","credit_id":"664cd5f36272462801304712","department":"Crew","job":"Poem"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638056,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yoo Ji-hyung","original_name":"Yoo Ji-hyung","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ebd0e8d3d3557001cdcaae4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0309768","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xHcibhmY6FiM9Qc6MVEk32Y4HJD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cbCsOrrsfUrzzisLtkMbPuZLVvL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bHfFibRSQeJVn3rjG3hPwb6wn9U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/9Ylxn4S4pcvQKKebgyTGmHBgO2w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":214548,"name":"1930s"},{"id":250212,"name":"japanese occupation of korea"},{"id":290327,"name":"seoul, south korea"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"My dear KeumHong(Geumhong-a Geumhong-a)(1995)","key":"CMgtODtrdLI","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-01-05T01:28:18.000Z","id":"5ebd0d0e3d3557001edd8dd1"}]}}}
