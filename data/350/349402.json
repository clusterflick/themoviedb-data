A quick look at a couple of \"nice old folks\" and that should be it. But it's just the beginning of the story (or rather stories). While the folks he meets are a bit long in the tooth, they have a lot to say. With Pumpkins and Old Lace, Juliette Loubières joins the classic tradition of puppet animation films, creating a sincere, whimsical fairy tale with a moral that reminds us that old age is sometimes a mask guarding the treasures of our souls.","popularity":0.4852,"poster_path":"/huPMhKYyOY0IzO1T9YNwIbBhyGT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76912,"logo_path":null,"name":"Département de la
