The film tells us the strange incidents that happen in the ruined old village. Comparing to Jon Jostâ€™s previous movies, this film has a clearer narrative and is more experimental with the structure as well. The essay film, which takes place in Missouri where they live an outdated lifestyle and where old culture still exists, confuses the boundary between fiction and non-fiction. The movie is based from a true story but instead of telling the exact story, the director casts real actors and gives a little twist to it. The actors explain about the inhumane incidents that happened in the village and while reviving it, they create their own narratives.","popularity":0.4235,"poster_path":"/raXA3ss01zvehViBcBOhklNtW6d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They
