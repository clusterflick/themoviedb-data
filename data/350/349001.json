The group originated in the late 1950s via the innovative efforts of Jacques Loussier, founder of the Play Bach Trio, then reformed some thirty-five years later (c. 1985) with Loussier, bassist Vincent Charbonnier and percussionist André Arpino, and an emphasis on stringing together an entirely new repertoire. This concert release presents an extended set by the second incarnation of the group. Selections include: Pastorale in C minor, Gavotte in B Minor, Fugue No. 5 in D Major, and Gavotte in D Major.","popularity":0.0795,"poster_path":"/4hmxU81NKUA6ocWilPZBnL53P8a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124843,"logo_path":"/aX6ufVP7tTY5XNLygICUEPxw6UV.png","name":"Productions Loft","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jacques Loussier Trio - Play Bach - The 1989 Munich Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35950,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jacques Loussier","original_name":"Jacques Loussier","popularity":0.148,"profile_path":"/tJPtOVdP7fFLZrLtUmgGT6QPF7j.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55a7d963c3a36847760004fa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3482645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Charbonnier","original_name":"Vincent Charbonnier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6240a9f4c740d9005d728908","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3482642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Arpino","original_name":"André Arpino","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gqSsu47jY8zRl8GXKCgT85mOZRQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6240a9be1cfe3a00476da991","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dieter Hens","original_name":"Dieter Hens","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6240aa0fc616ac0047808672","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4hmxU81NKUA6ocWilPZBnL53P8a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
