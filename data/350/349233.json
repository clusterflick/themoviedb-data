The tour promoted the recent IT’S HARD album, which had been released in June 1982, and the set list included a number of tracks from that album, some of which the band would only play live on this tour. This concert film features the show from the second of their two nights at New York’s Shea Stadium and was filmed on 13 October 1982.","popularity":1.107,"poster_path":"/mHqD0aBCClPYekS71JN85hbnNrB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Who: Live at Shea Stadium 1982","video":true,"vote_average":7.75,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Daltrey","original_name":"Roger Daltrey","popularity":0.7913,"profile_path":"/wQUIoUytxAoqaMpq2jW51v4CLhJ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55aa1809c3a3682ff9004e00","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1089120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenney Jones","original_name":"Kenney Jones","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":"/hazczupDMkyL0EfnzigAzSaS8yB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55aa1843c3a3682ff9004e08","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Townshend","original_name":"Pete Townshend","popularity":0.4168,"profile_path":"/juqxP6G6O7i4bOHuIwdyVHNyHME.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55aa184f92514125da004e12","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Entwistle","original_name":"John Entwistle","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":"/imepW0WY82SgtnL2mkddd0Q5b8U.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55aa1876c3a3682ff60053eb","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2893565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Roberts","original_name":"Chris Roberts","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd79e2ad8e22500401bfab8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231540,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Terry Shand","original_name":"Terry Shand","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602b9300d6d64d0042c8b414","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":231538,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Geoff Kempin","original_name":"Geoff Kempin","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602b930c81140f004193f54a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12821194","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kLzFTc3eDLxzmeGjGfgeMMNnQCQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mHqD0aBCClPYekS71JN85hbnNrB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"VHS","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD ","release_date":"2015-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
