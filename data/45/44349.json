But Will isn't really taking a sentimental journey at all: He's merely in town to modernize and streamline his family's real-estate company. While going through his grandfather's effects, Will and his grandmother come across the old man's diary--which reveals a lengthy relationship with a woman named Lillian.","popularity":2.4517,"poster_path":"/eS5FSn26Cbk1gBGDkjoxGfjgkV9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51811,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Polson
