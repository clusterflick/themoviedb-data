They make life unbearable for each other. To add spice to this situation, Uncle Maurice and Aunt Mala, Ernest's brother and sister, meddle in everything and, notably, try to find a \"nice little Jewish girl\" for Simon to marry. When Ernest passes away, Simon fulfils his father's last request: bury him in the village where he was born, in the depths of Ukraine. And so Simon finds himself caught up in an event-packed road movie in the company of his paranoid old uncle, his aunt who nags him endlessly about his \"Goy dancer\", his six-years-old son, his father's body and his ghost, and also a rabbit. Not to mention his ex who hassles him by phone. The journey will be nothing like a cruise down the Nile!","popularity":0.2095,"poster_path":"/eGMzbBylGZHUCOakMxohbG3kQM0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3040,"logo_path":"/aZww3B7RCFAMV1qrDZDrdeB8qcI.png","name":"Versus
