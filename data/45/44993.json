The city they’ve loved for decades has become a playground for the too-rich; their places, the ones they’ve frequented for years, are now refuges from a changing world they’re increasingly unable to keep up with. When Lenny—a lone schemer all his life—finally gets in over his head, he decides to seek the one thing he’s never had: true love. But to achieve it, he may have to abandon the only place he’s ever known. THE LAST NEW YORKER is a tale of friendship, love and the world’s greatest city -- and how all three keep us young and make us feel alive.","popularity":1.5829,"poster_path":"/3iX6I5F8cQnAh3I1II3phoUad19.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-19","revenue":6607,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You're never too broke to fall in love.","title":"The Last New Yorker","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominic Chianese","original_name":"Dominic Chianese","popularity":0.5189,"profile_path":"/wJIybLAbVv6VEPFpZtpxRW26aq2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lenny Sugarman","credit_id":"52fe46a9c3a36847f810b271","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Latessa","original_name":"Dick Latessa","popularity":0.1307,"profile_path":"/3UPF8ws6ZUbob2UjLUKfUlCLCKf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ruben","credit_id":"52fe46a9c3a36847f810b275","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":131880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Buddeke","original_name":"Kate Buddeke","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Connie","credit_id":"52fe46a9c3a36847f810b279","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Lloyd Burns","original_name":"Catherine Lloyd Burns","popularity":0.2681,"profile_path":"/dPi7v1T0haC9m0CzmtEKBf0rLT1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hostess","credit_id":"52fe46a9c3a36847f810b27d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":52003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Chalfant","original_name":"Kathleen Chalfant","popularity":0.3987,"profile_path":"/wjxN78pdzKpUiO9HG1vBqJdnf4x.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mimi","credit_id":"64a5962e8c44b9010c9d258f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Grifasi","original_name":"Joe Grifasi","popularity":0.5202,"profile_path":"/30c0szBZvqsk3nuOgg2A9PeSQFt.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jerry","credit_id":"64a596391bf26600e694b683","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Hamilton","original_name":"Josh Hamilton","popularity":0.7564,"profile_path":"/7nuAUPd7E8iOE5lhUcNpogS2akP.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Zach","credit_id":"64a5965a8c44b9014e3baeb7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":155573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irma St. Paule","original_name":"Irma St. Paule","popularity":0.1513,"profile_path":"/qtJmKcPHbTyveOE2NhLcsU04KUF.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Pearl","credit_id":"64a5966a8c44b9010c9d25ab","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":131878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harvey Wang","original_name":"Harvey Wang","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46a9c3a36847f810b26d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591276,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Adam Forgash","original_name":"Adam Forgash","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a595ed5a991500adf87d9b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0338187","wikidata_id":"Q47064323","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3iX6I5F8cQnAh3I1II3phoUad19.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Big Apple Film Festival","release_date":"2007-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
