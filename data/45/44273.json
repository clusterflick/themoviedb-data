After years of difficult negotiations and searching for the right spot, this was deemed to be the safest place on earth. Eventually, 4,5 million seed samples will be stored in this »Doomsday Vault« and ensure the continued existence of biodiversity.  But is the dream of global food security achievable? By 2050 temperatures worldwide are expected to rise by at least 2 degrees. This will result in a 30 per cent drop in production of food crops. By this time global food demand will have doubled. How will we feed the world?  In SEED WARRIORS we hear from the scientists behind this ambitious project and examine the reality of the fight against hunger.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2323,"logo_path":null,"name":"ican films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seed Warriors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":53747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mirjam von Arx","original_name":"Mirjam von Arx","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53b1055f0e0a26597d00776e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katharina von Flotow","original_name":"Katharina von Flotow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53b1056c0e0a26597d007771","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1588393","wikidata_id":"Q1311910","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
