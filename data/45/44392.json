After one check is cut and filming begins, high unemployment figures come out in the press. The producer feels he should take some money and build a factory to provide employment - but all he and Mograbi know is films, so he cuts a second check for Mograbi to do a film on injustices which might highlight the need for reforms.","popularity":0.0593,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Birthday, Mr. Mograbi","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ido Berger","original_name":"Ido Berger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"55215f729251415c87003b51","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1164972,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gidi Dar","original_name":"Gidi Dar","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55215f7b925141709600161d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shahar Degal","original_name":"Shahar Degal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55215f85c3a36834530016e1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Avi Mograbi","original_name":"Avi Mograbi","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/iQNxH2kKDrcFZJeTHfsd9Nrq6b9.jpg","credit_id":"55215f609251415c82003b26","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0198529","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
