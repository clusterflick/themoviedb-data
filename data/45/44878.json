This is a landscape and population that is changing rapidly as small scale agriculture is disappearing and the generation who inhabited a pre-mechanised world is dying out. Much influenced by his conversations with the writer Peter Handke, the film maker leads us on a poetic and profound journey into a world of endings and beginnings; a world of stuffed owls, sheep and fire.","popularity":0.4986,"poster_path":"/a4GJqz91B7NPysJQ5Vd639mmyGy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Welsh","iso_639_1":"cy","name":"Cymraeg"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sleep Furiously","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099396,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gideon Koppel","original_name":"Gideon Koppel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46a1c3a36847f8109793","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Figgis","original_name":"Mike Figgis","popularity":0.299,"profile_path":"/8qTZVgAlkb0N03CW66q1j2VTdQw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46a1c3a36847f8109799","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41793,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Serge Lalou","original_name":"Serge Lalou","popularity":0.1421,"profile_path":"/lJgdWev2t6vJL6I3984sFu92Nuk.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46a1c3a36847f810979f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":991016,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Margaret Matheson","original_name":"Margaret Matheson","popularity":0.1138,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46a1c3a36847f81097a5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122990,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aphex Twin","original_name":"Aphex Twin","popularity":0.1725,"profile_path":"/ffY2mm9yqiMdw98msS8DHPpRkLA.jpg","credit_id":"52fe46a1c3a36847f81097ab","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1084080,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mario Battistel","original_name":"Mario Battistel","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46a1c3a36847f81097b1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":75094,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tim Alban","original_name":"Tim Alban","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46a1c3a36847f81097b7","department":"Sound","job":"Foley"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1099398,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christer Melén","original_name":"Christer Melén","popularity":0.1485,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46a1c3a36847f81097bd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099396,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gideon Koppel","original_name":"Gideon Koppel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46a1c3a36847f81097c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099396,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gideon Koppel","original_name":"Gideon Koppel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46a1c3a36847f81097c9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1235072","wikidata_id":"Q25557133","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mAQ7lD90jCBj0fRvRNLpvJPdTIQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a4GJqz91B7NPysJQ5Vd639mmyGy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2735,"name":"veterinarian"},{"id":10668,"name":"stuffed animal"},{"id":182278,"name":"farming community"},{"id":182281,"name":"farming"},{"id":182282,"name":"baking"},{"id":182283,"name":"school closing"},{"id":182286,"name":"garden competition"},{"id":182287,"name":"sheep rustling"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"2008-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
