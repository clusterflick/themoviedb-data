Her helpful neighbor, Tom, introduces a young eligible Tony Braganza to Nancy in the 9:10 AM Western Railway local train from Bandra to Churchgate. Tom also asks Nancy to introduce Tony to Rosie, which she does. Rosie is initially apprehensive about him as he only drawing a mere Rs.300/ compared to Nancy's Rs.700/-, but soon changes her mind when she finds out that after his probationary period he will draw a monthly pay of Rs.1000/-. Nancy and Tom are permitted to meet and both eventually fall in love. While Nancy wants to follow her mother's directions and get married, Tony is hesitant, and this is what costs him Nancy's love, as she starts to feel that he will not come through with the marriage. And soon Rosie starts looking elsewhere for a son-in-law, while Tony is still reluctant to make any commitments.","popularity":0.4251,"poster_path":"/1B265Q95QVfn2NZOLjYyWVxgcFU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81915,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cineye Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1979-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baton Baton Mein","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Baton Baton Main","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amol Palekar","original_name":"Amol Palekar","popularity":0.2627,"profile_path":"/kUnejDjArzNVxouIaIj3WxxC83G.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tony Braganza","credit_id":"52fe4675c3a36847f81001ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":133417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Munim","original_name":"Tina Munim","popularity":0.3704,"profile_path":"/a6Tj59QGgJjI3nCs0YroAmHhkwj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nancy Perreira","credit_id":"52fe4675c3a36847f8100203","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1032107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pearl Padamsee","original_name":"Pearl Padamsee","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":"/mkdVFkLix2Z7PoD4zpHvYhPzYBC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Rosie Perreira (Nancy's mom)","credit_id":"52fe4675c3a36847f8100213","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Abraham Cheulkar","original_name":"David Abraham Cheulkar","popularity":0.2206,"profile_path":"/qlq3zKqvDaTEH5SGN6DY510YtDM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Uncle Tom","credit_id":"52fe4675c3a36847f810020b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Govardhan Asrani","original_name":"Govardhan Asrani","popularity":0.4893,"profile_path":"/zoZRnIHNkCRq4gKZGaQhbtPrIDj.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Francis Fernandes","credit_id":"568ad227c3a36860e902be71","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":630988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leela Mishra","original_name":"Leela Mishra","popularity":0.1543,"profile_path":"/n827OUemLIbQmRTI8hQBxuuOlld.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Philomena Aunty","credit_id":"52fe4675c3a36847f810020f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1033073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tun Tun","original_name":"Tun Tun","popularity":0.2397,"profile_path":"/y2ORD7WlbDnMVdlKbmq1dAMdeUm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Imaginary Nancy's mom","credit_id":"52fe4675c3a36847f8100217","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1035456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arvind Deshpande","original_name":"Arvind Deshpande","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mr. Braganza","credit_id":"52fe4675c3a36847f810021b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1035457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piloo J.
