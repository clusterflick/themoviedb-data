Hagar is a surrogate, an alternative partner for practical, sexual therapy. They meet once a week and practice a relationship and intimacy in laboratory conditions. The fictitious relationship between them exposes them both physically and emotionally and brings to surface repressed fears from the real world. The changes Eli goes through during the therapy, along with the secrets revealed, not only shake his own life, but also the life of his family. Between clinic walls, due to an \"artificial\" process, Eli learns how to love for the first time.","popularity":0.1229,"poster_path":"/tpzKKbODM5cuL7SQpXsh1hXHMml.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tali Shalom Ezer Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":76772,"logo_path":"/oGHBYYQfySC323WeaLaR7LyFhzW.png","name":"Marker Films","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2008-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surrogate","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amir Wolf","original_name":"Amir Wolf","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Eli","credit_id":"57363f0f9251410b21000c8c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":569336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lana Ettinger","original_name":"Lana Ettinger","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":"/eFb96rHvEiHi8dNw0RQtExYnFPq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hagar","credit_id":"57363f1a92514113dd000bc6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1195669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosina Kambus","original_name":"Rosina Kambus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Mother","credit_id":"57363f26c3a3687e2f000cf1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619509,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yonatan Swirski","original_name":"Yonatan Swirski","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Yarden","credit_id":"57363f31c3a3687e17000d0d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1147538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liat Glick","original_name":"Liat Glick","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Adva","credit_id":"57363f3cc3a3680ac0000c74","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lascha Shimshoni","original_name":"Lascha Shimshoni","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Marlen","credit_id":"57363f49c3a3687e2f000cf9","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1394326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tali Shalom-Ezer","original_name":"Tali Shalom-Ezer","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/pVuESpaF2kKRYipiDDIkAI9my0t.jpg","credit_id":"57363ef6c3a3687e1d000ca4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1394326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tali Shalom-Ezer","original_name":"Tali Shalom-Ezer","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/pVuESpaF2kKRYipiDDIkAI9my0t.jpg","credit_id":"57363efcc3a3687e2f000ceb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":566112,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Radek Ładczuk","original_name":"Radek Ładczuk","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/Id9yoModmqkGK2ZIAwOj0vymMA.jpg","credit_id":"66e3ff650000000000b9855a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1407081","wikidata_id":"Q7008143","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pSGsfG6fpQ8YQBR5tQjIlgalr7L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1750,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/fEs6kSYLCDbfHscA7gKfS1qDIPv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1166},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tpzKKbODM5cuL7SQpXsh1hXHMml.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
