A.C. is startled to be summoned to the White House, where top officials ask him to convert the toy factory into a weapons manufacturing company for the duration of the war. \"No\" is really not an option, for fear of being labeled unpatriotic so the switch is made. Later, government officials ask A.C. to be their spokesman for a campaign to avoid \"toy giving\" for the coming holidays and buy war bonds instead. With a young son himself, who looks forward to Christmas like any other child, what will A.C. do this time?","popularity":2.0085,"poster_path":"/duVZ4pnQhJA5sZ2IXqxXvvoX5DD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He couldn't stop the war, but he wouldn't let the war stop Christmas.","title":"The Man Who Saved Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Alexander","original_name":"Jason Alexander","popularity":2.0442,"profile_path":"/qRezZ2yhM2bmBERt7jVcxo8RVSA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"A.C.
