In the story of the adulteress Jesus confronts the Pharisees with the simple phrase, “let him without sin cast the first stone,” and thereby teaches us of God’s immense mercy and grace. Caiaphas, who unrighteously judges a blind man sinful, is contrasted against the gratitude of the blind man when Jesus freely heals him.","popularity":0.607,"poster_path":"/adjhfbdvLlmfV90VQePdCuO7wnq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4107,"logo_path":"/nV1eu9bqF38PufXbth8BrVltXWR.png","name":"NEST Family Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4108,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rich Animation Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":140873,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animated Bible Stories","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Righteous Judge","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Animated Stories from the New Testament 13 - The Righteous Judge","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1229807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Snegoff","original_name":"Gregory Snegoff","popularity":0.2018,"profile_path":"/kDooPIo8VB3R79zNB1GVRvmStfH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Caiaphas (voice)","credit_id":"6250ab02c613ce009e0a00ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":947905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Arrington","original_name":"James Arrington","popularity":0.2558,"profile_path":"/lS2qgyS9D41QiMarpoL9AJyrPn3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Assistant / Jezreel / Officer (voice)","credit_id":"6250ab1ae210230066c5644f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3498894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg L.
