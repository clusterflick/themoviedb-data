Jean Simmons portrays young Bess in this rich tapestry of a film that traces the tumultuous, danger-fraught years from Elizabeth's birth to her unexpected ascension to the throne at a mere 25. Charles Laughton reprises his Academy AwardÂ®-winning* role as her formidable father Henry VIII. Deborah Kerr plays her last stepmother (and Henry's last of six wives), gentle Catherine Parr. And Simmons' then real-life husband, Stewart Granger, adds heroics as Lord Admiral Thomas Seymour. In a resplendent world of adventure, romance and court intrigue, Young Bess reigns.","popularity":2.1224,"poster_path":"/yI8vCadGjFtMnJdkRWDGnXrB8rv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Great and Spectacular Drama!","title":"Young Bess","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":18,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Young Bess (1953)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Simmons","original_name":"Jean Simmons","popularity":1.5897,"profile_path":"/scbR91Bl4SbfQqhXaH6OfhjxfYt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Young Bess (Queen Elizabeth I)","credit_id":"52fe4698c3a36847f810782d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stewart Granger","original_name":"Stewart Granger","popularity":0.6025,"profile_path":"/1DDF3dXe7nKVWqGX9HEvQyMHaHr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Thomas Seymour","credit_id":"52fe4698c3a36847f8107831","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Kerr","original_name":"Deborah Kerr","popularity":0.9907,"profile_path":"/dHFhOEhHnn5cQjQN29IGRxzoxBP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Catherine Parr","credit_id":"52fe4698c3a36847f8107835","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Laughton","original_name":"Charles Laughton","popularity":0.7799,"profile_path":"/lhk6flmWDZMOLwq8VILMD6jH71F.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"King Henry VIII","credit_id":"52fe4698c3a36847f8107839","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kay Walsh","original_name":"Kay Walsh","popularity":0.2609,"profile_path":"/23pK7H4sxPATJ34g8N1yC2RFBTd.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. Ashley","credit_id":"52fe4698c3a36847f810783d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Rolfe","original_name":"Guy Rolfe","popularity":0.2907,"profile_path":"/u9hAhsWEo6gX8pVmp9LJE5zk57Z.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Ned Seymour","credit_id":"565cc1e39251415d28000a15","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Byron","original_name":"Kathleen Byron","popularity":0.2251,"profile_path":"/AftFBxZ30sYwhg7Eh7Sv5DfckYm.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Ann Seymour","credit_id":"565cc1f1c3a3682a0d000a2f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecil Kellaway","original_name":"Cecil Kellaway","popularity":0.3162,"profile_path":"/rGVj5ODGkAxEllJt2JZTtO7doIj.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Mr. Parry","credit_id":"565cc1fec3a3682a13000a47","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rex Thompson","original_name":"Rex Thompson","popularity":0.2442,"profile_path":"/5zQmlPHklcwoECLbQBOSWkovx5k.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Prince Edward / King Edward VI","credit_id":"565cc20f9251415d2c000997","order":8},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":78304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Arthur","original_name":"Robert Arthur","popularity":2.867,"profile_path":"/ppYxQZPddFPRzflyhGJzO8Whhj5.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Barnaby","credit_id":"565cc225c3a3682a10000a2e","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo G.
