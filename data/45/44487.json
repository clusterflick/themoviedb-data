Calling for a new era of DIY transgender self-representation, Haworth's feature debut is a comic, heartbreaking, and uplifting autobiography that breaks away from the marginalized depictions of trans people that populate mainstream media and focuses on the interpersonal relationships of a family who unexpectedly find their bonds strengthening as they overcome their preconceptions of gender and sexuality.","popularity":0.0891,"poster_path":"/rFZFaWIesnttADjhOP7rKVRnkz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2007-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She's a Boy I Knew","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1983842,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gwen Haworth","original_name":"Gwen Haworth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a9384fc0e0a2616c302aaf8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1095496","wikidata_id":"Q28132667","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rFZFaWIesnttADjhOP7rKVRnkz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cJBPBIlRiAC3cAmd3tUI82B61UH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Vancouver)","release_date":"2007-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
