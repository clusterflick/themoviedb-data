It's a confrontation between a couple: he demands to know what's wrong, she challenges his sexual orientation. Cameras shoot the exchange, and another camera records Greaves and his crew. Sometimes we watch the crew discussing this scene, its language, and the process of making a movie. Is there such a thing as natural language? Are all things related to sex? The camera records distractions - a woman rides horseback past them; a garrulous homeless vet who sleeps in the park chats them up. What's the nature of making a movie?","popularity":1.8024,"poster_path":"/a8INKiTZWT6DBkpIRVtv85tKunh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":254199,"logo_path":null,"name":"Take One Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":54,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Symbiopsychotaxiplasm","type":"original title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":557869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Ree Gilbert ","original_name":"Patricia Ree Gilbert ","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/rXkwLLUgKphkDE3l8CoTXvZ7yUi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Actress Testing for Alice","credit_id":"52fe469cc3a36847f8108459","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Fellows","original_name":"Don Fellows","popularity":0.217,"profile_path":"/2HFUZr73tp5BSOs02Ev7pGoDUfE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self - Actor Testing for Freddy","credit_id":"52fe469cc3a36847f8108461","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2667223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Gordon","original_name":"Jonathan Gordon","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/fN41WvMqHJNkcZHd1ixzVaRkMea.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Self - Soundman","credit_id":"5edabaa6f36a32002086c296","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Greaves","original_name":"William Greaves","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/9rzW1T4gT0lMvnu9oUG253Xnh51.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self - Director","credit_id":"5d42c9d4d8cc4a0015350213","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Anspach","original_name":"Susan Anspach","popularity":0.2578,"profile_path":"/o9PqTDLsktDUoaweBBLZj666G32.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self - Actress Testing for Alice (uncredited)","credit_id":"5d42ca087719d700136362ea","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2376769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Audrey Heningham","original_name":"Audrey Heningham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Black Lady Clapping Her Hands (uncredited)","credit_id":"5d43d28fb7abb500174935ea","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33057,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stevan Larner","original_name":"Stevan Larner","popularity":0.0843,"profile_path":"/y2CHjvMA6iFBLrhFbe2gsdx9m0L.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Self - Cameraman (uncredited)","credit_id":"5edabb50b458b8002049e68b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1335592,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terence Macartney-Filgate","original_name":"Terence Macartney-Filgate","popularity":0.0936,"profile_path":"/dnGX2sB5M7pifl3JYT8qfKyE2MF.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Self - Cameraman (uncredited)","credit_id":"5edabb68f36a32002086c2d7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2667229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Zeheri","original_name":"Maria Zeheri","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Self - Camera Assistant (uncredited)","credit_id":"5edabb7b8d52c90023a2a4c4","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57708,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert L.
