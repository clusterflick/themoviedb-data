Declared extinct in the 1940â€™s, the bird has apparently been spotted by numerous experts. Enter amateur birder and poet Johnny Neander, who has convinced his taciturn sidekick that he will be the one to find the elusive woodpecker. The ensuing chaos divides the small town between believers and non-believers, rabid environmentalists and opportunistic entrepreneurs. Much like the bird itself, Woodpecker explores the intersection of fact and fiction, manipulating our notions of documentary and narrative techniques within a tragic comedy about hope, perception, and some very very strange birds.","popularity":0.3635,"poster_path":"/1sTQ2gWXZHW7TKn10E8MyOKqYWW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Woodpecker","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1964399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Hyrns","original_name":"Jon Hyrns","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Johnny Neander","credit_id":"5a63f139c3a3687f8a017bf0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633544,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wesley Yang","original_name":"Wesley Yang","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Wes","credit_id":"6792b6e025d2980fb0237742","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Clay","original_name":"Billy Clay","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Mayor","credit_id":"6792b70c7660f09f3f48224b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Kemmer","original_name":"Sandra Kemmer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Brinkley Chamber of Commerce","credit_id":"6792b73725d2980fb023776f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4142821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kent Parham","original_name":"Kent Parham","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Sheriff, Monroe County","credit_id":"6792b75d25d2980fb0237789","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brother Jim Daniels","original_name":"Brother Jim Daniels","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Pastor, First Baptist Church","credit_id":"6792b76eace3eab82e183c12","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Boyd","original_name":"Lisa Boyd","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Owner, Ivory-Bill Nest","credit_id":"6792b7957660f09f3f4822a7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Miley","original_name":"Evelyn Miley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Brinkley Chamber of Commerce","credit_id":"6792b7a6c5081346f1482068","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Allen Sibley","original_name":"David Allen Sibley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Author,  Sibley Guide to Birds","credit_id":"6792b83a57975f1b0b1839d1","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5199290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan J.
