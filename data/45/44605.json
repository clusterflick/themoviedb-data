To fulfill their commission from a Swiss cultural festival, they adapted a great Swiss novel, “Aimé Pache, Painter from the Vaud,” by Charles Ferdinand Ramuz, from 1911 (about a local artist who goes to Paris for his education and then returns home) and extruded its autobiographical analogies to Godard’s own life and work. Using a choice set of clips from Godard’s films to coincide with events from the painter’s life, verbal references to modern times and to Godard’s own—Sartre, the late nineteen-sixties, the cinema—and images of the Swiss terrain, which plays a decisive role in the work of Pache, Godard, and Miéville (an important filmmaker in her own right), they produce the effect of mirrors within mirrors.","popularity":0.1474,"poster_path":"/62DbWVnFqCyHBUX4ECybPDj1tRy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8138,"logo_path":"/4P6c8TiJZhL2z7b0LbPOUTZwP4z.png","name":"Vega Film","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":33266,"logo_path":null,"name":"Périphéria","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2002-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An almost ecstatic recounting by Jean-Luc Godard of the making of a painting by the apocryphal artist Aimé Pache.","title":"Liberty and Homeland","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Gos","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Gos","popularity":0.2032,"profile_path":"/qpRbYXc7umQyTPTHg5rtJn1JGJH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"628fb6e389b561009f1b3957","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1777345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geneviève Pasquier","original_name":"Geneviève Pasquier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"628fb6e97d5db510a7288afe","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1419156,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gabriel Hafner","original_name":"Gabriel Hafner","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628fb6fcd48cee6cb205db58","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73858,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"François Musy","original_name":"François Musy","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628fb70476eecf00508af979","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95058,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne-Marie Miéville","original_name":"Anne-Marie Miéville","popularity":0.1899,"profile_path":"/aFz0xu9fuReVOm0rEzUVvHZ5Agw.jpg","credit_id":"628fb70e76eecf009a1bff63","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Luc Godard","original_name":"Jean-Luc Godard","popularity":1.0955,"profile_path":"/zP5EDY5MstfkdBmPXNCj8Y6v5KR.jpg","credit_id":"628fb7139a64350065b9bcd1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Luc Godard","original_name":"Jean-Luc Godard","popularity":1.0955,"profile_path":"/zP5EDY5MstfkdBmPXNCj8Y6v5KR.jpg","credit_id":"53377b779251417d9e001b3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95058,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne-Marie Miéville","original_name":"Anne-Marie Miéville","popularity":0.1899,"profile_path":"/aFz0xu9fuReVOm0rEzUVvHZ5Agw.jpg","credit_id":"53377b8d9251417da1001c59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Luc Godard","original_name":"Jean-Luc Godard","popularity":1.0955,"profile_path":"/zP5EDY5MstfkdBmPXNCj8Y6v5KR.jpg","credit_id":"58ef4bcfc3a368263300ab57","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95058,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne-Marie Miéville","original_name":"Anne-Marie Miéville","popularity":0.1899,"profile_path":"/aFz0xu9fuReVOm0rEzUVvHZ5Agw.jpg","credit_id":"58ef4bd7c3a3682626009bc5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0385051","wikidata_id":"Q3237862","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/62DbWVnFqCyHBUX4ECybPDj1tRy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
