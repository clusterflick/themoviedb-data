Feeble-minded Reza works at a bridal shop where he transports wedding dresses on his old, rickety bicycle. Reza spends his time communing with his long-dead mother at the cemetery, or with a dress mannequin in the shop window. One day, not long after the mannequin loses its head, Reza's life changes when a beautiful woman, accompanied by her maid, arrives at the store looking for bridal veils.","popularity":0.0618,"poster_path":"/NlCpuNJqN5sd4TJ2EiU8sSpJTd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2002-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Dream","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1938629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Amini","original_name":"Elizabeth Amini","popularity":0.0832,"profile_path":"/kZcv0VQWCjtA95YYiGZ5qGYxRre.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae096e2925141106c0133e0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1584147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hamid Jebeli","original_name":"حمید جبلی","popularity":0.2019,"profile_path":"/bUSmCJZfXy44UcaTp4Fo6nLczPw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Reza","credit_id":"5ae096f692514110690136cf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2029702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soghra Karimi","original_name":"Soghra Karimi","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae09707c3a3683db5014550","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2029703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yousef Yousef Pashandi","original_name":"Yousef Yousef Pashandi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ae0971bc3a3683db5014573","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1584147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hamid Jebeli","original_name":"حمید جبلی","popularity":0.2019,"profile_path":"/bUSmCJZfXy44UcaTp4Fo6nLczPw.jpg","credit_id":"5ae09744c3a3683d94014a94","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1584147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hamid Jebeli","original_name":"حمید جبلی","popularity":0.2019,"profile_path":"/bUSmCJZfXy44UcaTp4Fo6nLczPw.jpg","credit_id":"5ae0974f0e0a26155d0161da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119422,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Touraj Aslani","original_name":"Touraj Aslani","popularity":0.1258,"profile_path":"/z8FmjZ1yHOeMG6f4E9VcSTfpw88.jpg","credit_id":"5d326185caab6d1640a6cdc9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0319683","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1443,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/NlCpuNJqN5sd4TJ2EiU8sSpJTd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":964}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Fajr)","release_date":"2002-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
