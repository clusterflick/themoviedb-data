Harris jumps at the chance when the young man invites him to come to the small town to film a talent show. At the show, the man dons a blond wig and performs in drag as Olivia Newton John. Harris captures it all on tape: A portrait of a true outsider. Harris shot a dramatic piece, \"Beaver Kid 2\" based on the documentary; This interpretation of the story, made in 1981 on a home video camera with a budget of $100, features a young Sean Penn as \"the Beaver Kid\". Still possessed, Harris then rewrote the script, cast up-and-comer Crispin Glover in the lead, and created the final segment, \"The Orkly Kid\", with funding from the American Film Institute. The trilogy unveils the inner world of a fantastic character in three incarnations.","popularity":1.5614,"poster_path":"/zdKOqEM3yGOq8dhXATD6qcZTHWu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beaver Trilogy","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":24,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Orkly Kid","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Penn","original_name":"Sean Penn","popularity":2.54,"profile_path":"/9glqNTVpFpdN1nFklKaHPUyCwR6.jpg","cast_id":1003,"character":"\"Groovin' Larry\" Huff","credit_id":"52fe4678c3a36847f8100eab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crispin Glover","original_name":"Crispin Glover","popularity":2.4893,"profile_path":"/imBnLpSXvg61qDDdEfvL6R4ITKt.jpg","cast_id":1002,"character":"Larry Huff","credit_id":"52fe4678c3a36847f8100ea7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3586197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard LeVon Griffiths","original_name":"Richard LeVon Griffiths","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1008,"character":"Groovin' Gary","credit_id":"62a65d161c6329009e585e69","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"E.
