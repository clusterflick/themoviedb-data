As the minutes tick by, a battle for survival ensues where each of them is forced to examine their sordid ties to St. Julian-the building, as well as the legacy of the religious figure.","popularity":0.0377,"poster_path":"/R4oiRkR4jIUGSzfAGLbs4fsH0o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Stories of St. Julian","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":130521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ky Evans","original_name":"Ky Evans","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/x74ZjR7jZn9CIAIV8A2ne8ScWKi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe467ec3a36847f8102367","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":130523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shane Thueson","original_name":"Shane Thueson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe467ec3a36847f8102373","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":130522,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shane Thueson","original_name":"Shane Thueson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe467ec3a36847f810236d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1059790","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/R4oiRkR4jIUGSzfAGLbs4fsH0o.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
