She's scared and confused by this new existence. But, when she realizes she has been murdered, she's furious. She's determined to find her killer and get justice, believing that it was someone she knew. Impulsive and restless, Neve regrets never leaving her isolated community. And, as she comes to terms with her abilities, she begins to destabilize the lives of those she left behind. Particularly her estranged father, Tom and her beloved mother Maria. Neve is a disruptive, unsettling hero who should not exist, and she needs to find her purpose. She takes us through the investigation into her death, going where the police can't. In the process she uncovers deeply buried secrets and is forced to re-examine everything about her life and the people she cared about.","popularity":1.1852,"poster_path":"/cEZtdeCFmpmoM7cQRiaVUfzeXNx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135346,"logo_path":"/hIwjhVdOOQ1fpdebwOuDQD7bnw0.png","name":"Sky
