He genuinely loves Michigan. He is Michigan in so many ways.\"\r Joel Klatt -  I will miss Jim Harbaugh. I will miss his integrity. I will miss his authenticity. I will miss how he is a true leader who takes the bullets when it goes bad, but heaps the praise on his players when it goes good. I will miss all his sayings and quotes and how much he loves his players. There is no other coach like Coach Harbaugh. Thank you for everything.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harbaugh: A Michigan Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
