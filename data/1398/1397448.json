Experimentation with the vertical displacement of the image of a 35 mm film. 35mm film has four perforations per image. If the perforations are offset from the projector window, the image is split in two on the screen: for example, in a face image, the eyes are at the bottom and the mouth is at the top; The image has two displaced parts. To avoid this mistake, this multi-image movie uses collage. The filmmaker assembles an image by perforation (the normal technique is an image by 4 perforations). Therefore, there is never a vertical shift in the projected image.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/p5BjlKVDo309g25TNX6kTMlEr2l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1982-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Movie Watching","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575125,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jun'ichi Okuyama","original_name":"Jun'ichi Okuyama","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/yE2u1iLL1gSVElJGbKzZeErqrDc.jpg","credit_id":"6750886c6e101d94911a67e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2287921","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p5BjlKVDo309g25TNX6kTMlEr2l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
