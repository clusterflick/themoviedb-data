The film maker Anna Zett is seen spray painting short questions and statements onto large mounds of pebble gravel, where every step leads to a rockslide. The action is interspersed with found footage filmed by Klaus Freymuth, showing demonstrators writing and painting onto the East side of the Berlin Wall shortly after the border was opened in November 1989.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endarchiv","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2943434,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Zett","original_name":"Anna Zett","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6751b48d8e033e9136dc6e56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100458,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nadja Krüger","original_name":"Nadja Krüger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6751b4e9871a42c9c2451071","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323420,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jochen Jezussek","original_name":"Jochen Jezussek","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6751b503f043bd8a602724f8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
