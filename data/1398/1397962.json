His extraordinary home, The Steading, is a Grade A-listed work of art in Scotland - a lifelong project of organic form, skill and love that he carved from wood. However, it is an uphill battle for Maggy Stead and her friends to save Tim's lifeworks for future generations to be inspired by. Tim Stead started the first UK community woodland back in 1987, was a passionate educator, brought mesmerising shapes out of wood into furniture, art installations and interiors, and wrote poetry. Yet, few have heard of this trailblazer - will The Steading be preserved, or left to be forgotten?","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/16IjE2EgZ93jMuL0TSXOJBwqDkB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246473,"logo_path":null,"name":"TrixPixMedia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The whole inside story of a man, a tree, a wood and a sculpted home.","title":"Tim Stead: Magician With Wood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Stead","original_name":"Tim Stead","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6751d4b472d1a8a59c298ae9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maggy Stead","original_name":"Maggy Stead","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6751d4e572d1a8a59c298af6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giles Sutherland","original_name":"Giles Sutherland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6751d51272d1a8a59c298b14","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eoin Cox","original_name":"Eoin Cox","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6751d54d84ca928d00c9eada","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beatrix A.
