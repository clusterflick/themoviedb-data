The film is a deconstruction and reimagining of the female monster character Broodmother in video games. The Broodmother is a new species of fully digitised, slimy spider-like creature with the ability to devour, vomit, scream and breed demons. In this work, the Broodmother transforms into a powerful avatar that tells a scientific myth about life, nurture, ecology, and technology.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Br00dm0ther's e-Fable","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100476,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zijing Zhao","original_name":"Zijing Zhao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6751badb84ca928d00c9e50d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
