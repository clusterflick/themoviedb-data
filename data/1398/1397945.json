Edited after his move to Paris, the film takes on the quality of a solemn departure as locations and landmarks that have appeared in previous work are shadowed in the dark oranges and yellows of sunset. Perhaps classifiable as one of Kostrov’s landscape films, it stands out because of its unsettled framing. No longer on a tripod, the camera trembles in the filmmaker’s hands, his breath interwoven with the sounds of the environment.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Look of Autumn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
