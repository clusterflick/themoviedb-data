Despite his tireless enthusiasm, his health tells him that his days as a flamenco master are coming to an end. His art saved him from starvation and the cinemas sheltered him from the cold during the Spanish post-war period. And it was on the big screen that he met his admired Fred Astaire, who settled in his imagination as a fantasy to aspire to. And as he awaits his long-awaited American adventure, Carrete looks back on his past. Joaquín, one of his sons, who was a talented guitarist and whose hopes were dashed by prison, wants to play again. Father and son try to find each other again, while the mirage of the giant skyscrapers fades away, revealing the reality.","popularity":0.1131,"poster_path":"/9kLqNQhwgoGajPbHpf1rdcbD7UL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Womack
