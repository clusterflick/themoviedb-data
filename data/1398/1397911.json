But when an alien invasion upends Earth's existence, the queen encounters new challenges that forebode terrifying outcomes for humanity. Trapped within the library, her storytelling skills are suddenly put to extraordinary tests, jeopardizing the lives of the last humans on Earth - the families who've cherished her stories and the protesters who've scorned them. Ultimately, it is the supreme power of imagination that holds the key to both the queen's survival and the invaders' domination.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fUwu1qcGUJnCqcZac9SfPuWCHYm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Story on Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Immediato","original_name":"Aaron Immediato","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6751b9a380e5b8f0a756132f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34801882","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fUwu1qcGUJnCqcZac9SfPuWCHYm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
