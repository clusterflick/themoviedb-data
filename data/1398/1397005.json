The film traces this area’s agricultural beginnings, its development in the 1970s and the significant demographic transformation when Indian immigrants began to settle on and around Oak Tree Road in the following decades.  Viewers experience, through first-hand accounts, that this evolution did not come without a price, as those who settled were met with resistance from local residents. The film seeks to discover how the Indian American/South Asian American community came to the area in the first place and then revitalized it into today’s international tourist attraction.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/ntH1FaugGkv0K1BEyLbeKsfO0UK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Destination Oak Tree Road","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33290495","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1755,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ntH1FaugGkv0K1BEyLbeKsfO0UK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1170}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
