People, tired of everyday struggling for survival, keep their inertial meaningless existence. In a little, isolated house at the edge of the city live two elderly sisters. Lily (60 years old) works as a Cableway conductor and guides workers from the city to the factory every day. Tatyana (64 years old) is unemployed and mainly is busy doing housework. Despite poor living conditions, their micro world had been idyllic, before Lily got a chance to leave Chiatura, moving in another city with her daughter. On a farewell day tension rises between the sisters. Tatyana still hopes and believes that Lily will change her mind and will not abandon her. At the same time she realizes that it`s the last chance for her to escape from swamp and spend her last years with her daughter.","popularity":0.7499,"poster_path":"/wg2YBAv5HsWOOIiSUKyOl8nOLtv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94802,"logo_path":"/za6AmJNMqbsOoPYUl3hpXtdjIta.png","name":"Artizm","origin_country":"GE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exodus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5099442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lili Bitsadze","original_name":"Lili Bitsadze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6750db5f8012f93dbc69b830","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5099444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatiana Bitsadze","original_name":"Tatiana Bitsadze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6750db6a21e1eacac6f03893","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5099441,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vakhtang Jajanidze","original_name":"Vakhtang Jajanidze","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/aJbMzIHCcAR3KFOJ13nmM28HgfG.jpg","credit_id":"6750db42cb1e120ccb5de606","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5099441,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vakhtang Jajanidze","original_name":"Vakhtang Jajanidze","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/aJbMzIHCcAR3KFOJ13nmM28HgfG.jpg","credit_id":"6750db4a8012f93dbc69b816","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1299571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tinatin Kajrishvili","original_name":"თინათინ ყაჯრიშვილი","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6750db925ace98ba46d487e2","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2185919,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lasha Khalvashi","original_name":"Lasha Khalvashi","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6750dba421e1eacac6f0389b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4391543,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sandro Wysocki","original_name":"Sandro Wysocki","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6750dbbb21e1eacac6f038a2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5099450,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Tamaz Bochoidze","original_name":"Tamaz Bochoidze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6750dbd7cb1e120ccb5de62f","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4278971,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Keti Nozadze","original_name":"Keti Nozadze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6750dbee5f744bf1741e1e6b","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4278971,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Keti Nozadze","original_name":"Keti Nozadze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6750dc26fd69f3d4fb65d451","department":"Art","job":"Property Master"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5135618","wikidata_id":"Q30607816","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cAXgQTvEmNvTFRKEbtbEic0TQJB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wg2YBAv5HsWOOIiSUKyOl8nOLtv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
