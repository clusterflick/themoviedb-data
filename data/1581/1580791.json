Both his uncle and girlfriend try to set his path straight again, but he revels his old days of performing rituals to tell fortunes and 'heal' people. Having a clear conscience and defending his affirmations on being a charlatan, he reconnects with his master and continues with the old trade.

When unexpected circumstances unfold, will Man Chun retain his faith in his vocation?","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/j8IWXeGcgzmhusasfvRIrVKlpl3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61392,"logo_path":"/e1g54NyBA3ICLice0kKOYHMc84u.png","name":"Fresh Wave","origin_country":"HK"},{"id":61393,"logo_path":"/zBPeWCDSwQ2PDSRHacdt4HPHw3n.png","name":"Hong Kong Arts Development Council","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2014-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Charlatan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1333234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie Ho","original_name":"Leslie Ho","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Kong Man Chun","credit_id":"691773a61076f8473dac2c13","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1416065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Kwok Fung","original_name":"郭鋒","popularity":1.4589,"profile_path":"/ZsCpOKqMKARlOrjonsKW8CQQ6P.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hung Kun","credit_id":"691773cf0ccc7fff2a40e970","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4256188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cheung Chin Hung","original_name":"Cheung Chin Hung","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69176c3eb5004f2d5ea0e33f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4256188,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cheung Chin Hung","original_name":"Cheung Chin Hung","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69176c64591b1bb437a0e39c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5817217,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lai Chun Kit","original_name":"Lai Chun Kit","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69176ee2aee235a1df31cdf4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5305389,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ho Ching-yi","original_name":"何靜怡","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"691775d347d1fab49c31cbd8","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4446159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lam Tsz Pui","original_name":"Lam Tsz Pui","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6917760763fc15e27b9c58a5","department":"Directing","job":"Second Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":983,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eMQ6l6wUeXh8eJhWjYYyTmGTRmf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1749},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":983,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mwQcgOa9n2m8kQBT6WUq5PdsCLP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1749},{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1310,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r3FhqP9tUlfGQbfKrltX4I7Z9O1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2332},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":983,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1vwCKl8i3XYbkc0bO0PIjo6hyoj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1749},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":983,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i2QgivhYOWy0lad5JA849GvUcLm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1749}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1554,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j8IWXeGcgzmhusasfvRIrVKlpl3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1036}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Fresh Wave International Short Film Festival 2014","release_date":"2014-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Fresh Wave 鮮浪潮 2014 競賽短片《神棍 Charlatan》trailer","key":"uDfCnDDiz2Y","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-11-06T03:34:00.000Z","id":"69176956540af423d04c9ea9"}]}}}
