Her sensual and rigorously intellectual works explore desire, sexuality and the body. Produced alongside a major retrospective exhibition, organised by London’s Barbican Art Gallery, this film provides a rare opportunity to to reflect on her art. Important installations are featured, such as Ego Geometria Sum, which uses photographs of her own naked body, and the Baroque fantasy The Oval Court, as well as more controversial pieces, including Cacao, a fountain of hot bubbling chocolate, and the Piss Flowers, sculptures made by casting the holes left after urinating in snow.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lQ6uw020K8J9jTJTM10yEaeISP4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This understated, perfectly judged film from the ever-reliable Illuminations stable provides a fitting memorial for the artist.","title":"The Art of Helen Chadwick","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lQ6uw020K8J9jTJTM10yEaeISP4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1060}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
