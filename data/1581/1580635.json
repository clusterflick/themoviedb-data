(Re)live the magical atmosphere of one of the band's shows, as if you were on stage with them. Twenty years after Les Cowboys Fringants' historic recording at the Bell Centre in 2003, which marked the end of their exceptional Break syndical tour, the band did it again in January 2023 with a concert filmed at the Videotron Centre during their Les Antipodes tour, which broke all attendance and ticket sales records. Les Cowboys Fringants are no strangers to large-scale concerts, having repeatedly filled the Bell Centre and Videotron Centre to capacity, as well as dozens of arenas in French-speaking Europe. With a festive crowd, an incomparable connection with the audience, visibly moved fans, breathtaking cinematic images, and the band's greatest hits, this new recording is reminiscent of historic rock concert films!","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Cowboys Fringants: Québec/14/01/2023","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38693652","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
