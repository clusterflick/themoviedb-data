A green frog with unusual orange and black coloring—seen for the first time—as well as a strange red frog. Scientists are trying to determine the cause – whether these are \"natural errors\" in a few specimens, or whether the entire frog population is affected – with environmental pollution being cited as one of the reasons. In a parallel story the scientists are conducting research on the restored tree frog population, observing the results of a project implemented in the 1990s – at that time, the extinct tree frog species was successfully restored and is once again found on the Kurzeme coast.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jLG5ek8QA5MzWXc22GlRQIa3vNn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74746,"logo_path":null,"name":"Riverbed","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2025-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frog Safari","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2697104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agnese Laizāne","original_name":"Agnese Laizāne","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":"/pTAlzUfZp4w8vif8fpf3BORLT96.jpg","credit_id":"69167ea5c5c5faff3aa0e0a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andris Gauja","original_name":"Andris Gauja","popularity":0.0756,"profile_path":"/5O4NFzLE4GgzCJK9OhLjwwMi07Q.jpg","credit_id":"69167ebb0ccc7fff2a40e587","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2165805,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Toms Šķēle","original_name":"Toms Šķēle","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69167ef14194ebdee1ac25fc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2506661,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Toms Krauklis","original_name":"Toms Krauklis","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69167f083a7b019fa89adb76","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2506661,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Toms Krauklis","original_name":"Toms Krauklis","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6916854c78d69718849c53c8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2222,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jLG5ek8QA5MzWXc22GlRQIa3vNn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1481}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":238508,"name":"environmental issues"},{"id":272851,"name":"environmental documentary"},{"id":362110,"name":"tree frogs"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lv","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
