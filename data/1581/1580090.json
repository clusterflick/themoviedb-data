She also spends considerable time with Victor Raymier, the artist who is painting her portrait, unaware that he is a fraud who merely signs his name to the work of a real artist in his employ. One day, Victor persuades Patricia to accompany him to his country home. A storm forces them indoors and the fake artist proceeds to make unwanted advances on Patricia. The Masons come to her rescue, and following their return to the city, Patricia telephones her husband, asking him to come home. He informs her that the proceeds from his new oil well will enable him to be a full-time husband.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/empGRxzCDuLF4q6CfuRMmtMXNZ2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166858,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sawyer-Lubin Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1923-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Your Friend and Mine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"嵐に叫ぶ声","type":"Japanese title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":930690,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enid Bennett","original_name":"Enid Bennett","popularity":0.1817,"profile_path":"/1vQDnUFq2XnAuxGuYiJFImiBa85.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Patricia Stanton","credit_id":"6915cdd29913d3c4f98772ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Huntley Gordon","original_name":"Huntley Gordon","popularity":0.1211,"profile_path":"/dlZO1dnpaVuiJyZ3BitziRgolXB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hugh Stanton","credit_id":"6915cde544d974b7e99c5258","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1004953,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Willard Mack","original_name":"Willard Mack","popularity":0.1404,"profile_path":"/eXm5yWoBI7NmVwGs2GZsyMiWAT4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ted Mason","credit_id":"6915cdf84ef72b612e31c662","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosemary Theby","original_name":"Rosemary Theby","popularity":4.1145,"profile_path":"/5vfVa2QJXqsVRnMFJWVur9YhNyN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Beatrice Mason","credit_id":"6915ce1dad78ce5faeac2387","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
