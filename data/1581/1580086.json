In the early 2000s, a young comic artist decided to tell stories through drawings, far from the canons of mainstream comics. He did it under the banner of DIY and sharing: small, stapled booklets, photocopied, bound, and mailed directly. In those strips, suspended between anticipation and memory, the stories are about lives that intersect, friendships, love, out-of-town students, the disorientation before growing up, fanzines, and self-produced records. In the background, the quiet indolence of the provinces. That young comic artist became Alessandro Baronciani, now one of the leading figures in Italian authorial comics, and that project was \"Una storia a fumetti\".","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hjVL1IlpWIhhWgPEZVmjoCMVtpv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":245379,"logo_path":null,"name":"MIUR
