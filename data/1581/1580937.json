You’ll hear music from over 30 of the artists, including Arch Enemy, Bullet for My Valentine, Borknager, Barb Wire Dolls, Triptykon, Saxon, Metal Church, Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons and Steel Panther. Once your ear-drums are begging for a breather, you can gorge your eyes on the following footage from many of the same artists, including Axel Rudi Pell, Entombed A.D. Red Fang and Tarja Turunen, plus experience the emotional tribute to legendary Motörhead founder Ian ‘Lemmy’ Kilmister, “Born To Lose, Live To Win”.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/g8WfVymzJ2UGrBRMMKa8oFCSKGo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"27 Years.
