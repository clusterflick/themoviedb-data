Kjartansson, along with nine other performers, donned outfits to mimic this postcard and performed a fragile chorus on repeat in a similar idyllic, pastoral setting. In a confluence of references from classical pastoral painting to traditional romantic ballads, the film evokes a portrait of unrequited love as well as a Buddhist sense of acceptance.
