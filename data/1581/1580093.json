And this one has been paying you for seven years. Alright, I know she doesn't pay you directly, that it's her children who give you the cash, but the money is still hers. But what is she paying you for?\"  It is the voice-over of Domenico who says these things, a presence in absentia, always outside the frame, simultaneously inside and outside of what is happening. He is addressing Ferdinando, the \"damo\" of Genziana, an elderly woman being gradually eroded by senile dementia (\"May total oblivion carry away everything, if possible; otherwise, let silence cover it,\" as the epigraph borrowed from Titus Livius states). He reads passages of literature to her. She tells him what she remembers. In his free time, Ferdinando visits modernist architecture and spiritual places.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":115725,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lab 80 film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2025-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Il Damo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5814637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Davide Pinardi","original_name":"Davide Pinardi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6915ceee3a7b019fa89ad7f2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5814638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martine Bucci","original_name":"Martine Bucci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6915cf0a908b0e308bac2377","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4447986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Domenico Monetti","original_name":"Domenico Monetti","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6915cf2264a32b21624c93df","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Ferri","original_name":"Luca Ferri","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6915cf4dd0450fa3063a41eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luca Ferri","original_name":"Luca Ferri","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6915cf60d1da7ed6a28765f4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1086898,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alessandro Rota","original_name":"Alessandro Rota","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6915cf755fb76ce1f8a0de2d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5814639,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Claudio Cristini","original_name":"Claudio Cristini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6915cf8c95143dfa46a0db53","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2703878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Spina","original_name":"Giuseppe Spina","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/A4Cr9zx36iR3lVV4XILvu7lrxoV.jpg","credit_id":"6915cfa32859dd97554c9548","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2515753,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrea Zanoli","original_name":"Andrea Zanoli","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6915cfb7cf0d14c7a49c5067","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"FilmMakerFest 25","release_date":"2025-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
