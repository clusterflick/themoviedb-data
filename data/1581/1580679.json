Daphne falls in love with Tom Dunstan, but when she learns that Mrs. Trowbridge favors the young man, she deserts him, whereupon he departs for the woods brokenhearted. Because her aunt dislikes Gerald, Daphne accepts his proposal, but on the day of the wedding, she discovers that Mrs. Trowbridge has liked him from the beginning. Furious at her aunt's scheming, Daphne hires the first man she meets, who happens to be a heavily bearded lumberman, to marry her and then leave. Later, however, her hired husband abducts her to his cabin in the woods, where he eventually succeeds in taming her. After he rescues her from two lecherous lumberjacks, Daphne discovers that her husband is Tom, whom she had loved all along.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/o1pwuxffc3Qqn2nu8KPGnc1Q65O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She Hired a Husband","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Un mari pour Gilberte","type":"French title"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"第二の結婚","type":"Japanese title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Priscilla Dean","original_name":"Priscilla Dean","popularity":0.1641,"profile_path":"/twj8OOwEL8vlkD7h5sF7pFL8gk2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Daphne Trowbridge","credit_id":"69174206763b5097ddac29bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1239954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat O'Malley","original_name":"Pat O'Malley","popularity":0.3408,"profile_path":"/4evplBNQp1k390ec2Ivrvp4jSF8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tom Dunstan","credit_id":"6917422e5b452b4483a0e4a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1549456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marian Skinner","original_name":"Marian Skinner","popularity":0.1345,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Trowbridge","credit_id":"69174240560020a6de40e7b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Vroom","original_name":"Frederick Vroom","popularity":0.18,"profile_path":"/nGnxOg6NMKbyxs9V4cdXsRzPRqx.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mr. Trowbridge","credit_id":"69174252dec356429f40e76e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"F.A.
