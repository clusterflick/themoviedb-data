His brilliant, frequently hysterical commercials for Wendy's, Alaska Airlines, Federal Express and others were snappy slices of cultural quirk that tapped into the Cold War-fearing, corporate workaholic zeitgeist of the '70s and '80s with a sense of humor that cracked billions of smiles, sold billions of burgers, and sped up the default rhythm of time-based media.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/kPcPRlrHRoVd7G9QDyU9a0jqTEy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":280384,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bloggs Productions LTD","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"More storyteller than ad man","title":"Point of View: A Retrospective of Joe Sedelmaier","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1348826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Sedelmaier","original_name":"Joe Sedelmaier","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6915f5d3e07d80bcbbac23c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2246841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Plante","original_name":"Mike Plante","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6915f5fee24e363ff98762eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3222,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Mulvehill","original_name":"Charles Mulvehill","popularity":0.1627,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6915f60fd2cd4e571740e21d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Moschitta Jr.","original_name":"John Moschitta Jr.","popularity":0.2596,"profile_path":"/o5BGJDlLzy00oQiEUMYk78JGSRe.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6915f623ad9e766f534ca129","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2483092,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Trevor Groth","original_name":"Trevor Groth","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6915ffa0c14a37294e4c953f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1625089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Garfield","original_name":"Bob Garfield","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6915ffb0dfa21e6e1340e344","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":115347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cliff Freeman","original_name":"Cliff Freeman","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6915ffc0a4a1c96cc831c827","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5814883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Delaney","original_name":"Tim Delaney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6915ffee86f8f3fce7ac247d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5814884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Deighton","original_name":"John Deighton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"69160017034982ba0940e326","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":115345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Clow","original_name":"Lee Clow","popularity":0.1515,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"691600249de4988bb440e355","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5814885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John E.
