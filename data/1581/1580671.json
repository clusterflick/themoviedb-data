The two hold a house party for Pell Kingston, who buys pork and beans for the United States Army, to negotiate a contract. To convince Martha of the merits of kissing, the shy Rudolph asks Pell to kiss her in the dark, and when she responds favorably, Rudolph claims the credit. Martha discovers that Pell, to whom she is attracted, actually kissed her, but things become confused when Mrs. Irene Chandler also demonstrates an interest in Pell. After several amatory mix-ups, everything is cleared up, and Pell and Martha leave the party together.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/8zo659EuWqzjQTLYkSys9iKrIFl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Camouflage Kiss","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le baiser camouflé","type":"French title"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"A.-B.Ärter och fläsk","type":"Swedish title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2388275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Caprice","original_name":"June Caprice","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/86le24kmVzD6IJGvovQxo4oV9fz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Martha Thorne","credit_id":"69173b38160c5cef5b40e8ca","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Thornton","original_name":"Bernard Thornton","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Rudolph King","credit_id":"69173b6b95aa21afb7a0e37f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1961275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pell Trenton","original_name":"Pell Trenton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/69PgasGCpoeEzBnKYiO9Nu1wiz6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pell Kingston","credit_id":"69173b7d2859dd97554c9a56","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Bunny","original_name":"George Bunny","popularity":0.0792,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"John Chandler","credit_id":"69173b8e312ecd29889adccd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1372522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lola May","original_name":"Lola May","popularity":0.1916,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Irene Chandler","credit_id":"69173ba5f125b88b5631ca38","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1386786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry F.
