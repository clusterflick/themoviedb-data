Zion's Cooperative Mercantile Institution, founded by Mormon colonizer Brigham Young, started in 1868 and lasted through its sale in December 1999. The name ZCMI remained until 2002 when it was changed to Meier and Frank. Auerbach's was the other major department store in Utah. Frederick and Samuel Auerbach's began the Salt Lake City store in 1879. It flourished in two different locations until it closing in February 1979. This KUED production documents both of these grand and iconic Utah department stores through memories of those who shopped and worked in them. interviews clips focus on ZCMI's Christmas windows, the hot dog stand in the basement, and the Tiffen Room restaurant. Former shoppers at Auerbach's remember the elegant Crystal Room and the giant chandeliers and much more.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vV8UcybLjjx6WTUfeRMWBQqdXYm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94564,"logo_path":null,"name":"KUED","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Auerbach's and ZCMI Memories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5817078,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ted Capener","original_name":"Ted Capener","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xhyToGPJxRjn29pdIdZXieoNYmn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Host","credit_id":"6917641fd20f50e31d3a4c58","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5817080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russ L.
