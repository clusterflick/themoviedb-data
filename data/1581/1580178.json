The film combines interviews with Suzuki’s father, mother, sister, and his father’s disciples, with footage of the mountain house in which his father went to live and conduct his religious activities. Suzuki’s father’s phone conversation with one of his disciples is depicted, as well as his explanation of the appearance of spirits in photographs.
