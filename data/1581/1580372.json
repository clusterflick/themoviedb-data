In exchange for her revealing journals, Jack helps Lucy escape her Santa Fe nursing home and drive her home to North Dakota. Along the way, they pick up Anna, a free-spirited hitchhiker who disrupts their uneasy companionship. But their unlikely road trip takes an unexpected turn when a local detective sets out to track them down.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78555,"logo_path":null,"name":"International Film Trust","origin_country":""},{"id":6692,"logo_path":"/2Wd2CodKtgB4XyAQH4ez8qnZuqg.png","name":"Benaroya Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Lucy Boomer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ansel Elgort","original_name":"Ansel Elgort","popularity":1.5904,"profile_path":"/pbU6qz8eudly20UE6u9T7jUXTgT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jack Ritchie","credit_id":"69166aa8965b35bb239ad8a9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirley MacLaine","original_name":"Shirley MacLaine","popularity":1.9838,"profile_path":"/mpW9c34IAFPW0ODuKR8J0FAqN5i.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lucy Boomer","credit_id":"69166ac62b99e7c7694c96be","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26502,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Howard Deutch","original_name":"Howard Deutch","popularity":0.7363,"profile_path":"/9MOjJAkLZHET0IrKsV6ysUryfs7.jpg","credit_id":"69166add567ac822129c540e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102705,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ron Cutler","original_name":"Ron Cutler","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69166af4aee235a1df31ca1d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Steven Johnson","original_name":"Mark Steven Johnson","popularity":1.5305,"profile_path":"/fhMvsLJyTDfj39qPSR6ZBEEMoDE.jpg","credit_id":"69166b029de4988bb440e5e9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5815695,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Russell Hill","original_name":"Russell Hill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69166b0f883685b575a0c63f","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Steven Johnson","original_name":"Mark Steven Johnson","popularity":1.5305,"profile_path":"/fhMvsLJyTDfj39qPSR6ZBEEMoDE.jpg","credit_id":"69166b30f2f7e3b1b487692a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937171,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Benaroya","original_name":"Michael Benaroya","popularity":0.0979,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69166b41c4ea5b5c2e3a4461","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2574181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Grodnik","original_name":"Dan Grodnik","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69166b50eba221c4a93a445d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437641,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alan J.
