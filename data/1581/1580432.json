His world revolves around taking care of his father Paco and two brothers Bogs and Boy, who love and protect him. When Maxie meets a young, handsome, and idealistic policeman Victor, the two quickly form a friendship and Maxie begins to realize that he can have a better life, which soon incurs the ire and disapproval of Maxie’s family. Torn between his emerging affection for Victor and unquestioning devotion to his father and brothers, “Maxie The Musical” is a tale of lost innocence and redemption amidst poverty and corruption.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/avflA4P8NwRAAiX0xqW3WEKCrTJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":280423,"logo_path":null,"name":"bit by bit","origin_country":""},{"id":280424,"logo_path":null,"name":"PETA Theater Center and the Cultural Center of the Philippines","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2013-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A new bromance craze has hit town.","title":"Maxie The Musical: Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1864044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jhayvot Galang","original_name":"Jhayvot Galang","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Maxie","credit_id":"69169687540af423d04c9ab2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1864208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jojo Riguerra","original_name":"Jojo Riguerra","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Victor","credit_id":"69169abd57e51d6fe73a44a0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5815904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nazer Salcedo","original_name":"Nazer Salcedo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mang Paco","credit_id":"69169ae35a5c69041b40e5c0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3799228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg De Leon","original_name":"Greg De Leon","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Chief Dominguez","credit_id":"69169b17579b325ab63a490b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5815905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Gatmaitan","original_name":"Al Gatmaitan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Boy","credit_id":"69169b57591b1bb437a0df5d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5815906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Gonzaga","original_name":"Jay Gonzaga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bogs","credit_id":"69169b6fb5004f2d5ea0dee8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5815907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teetin Villanueva","original_name":"Teetin Villanueva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Maxie's friend","credit_id":"69169ba2b83adf228eac2821","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5815908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nomer Limatog Jr.","original_name":"Nomer Limatog Jr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Maxie's friend","credit_id":"69169bb887eb54ced231c7b7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1519736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Ching","original_name":"Aaron Ching","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Maxie's friend","credit_id":"69169bd141b0b93d78a0e2fd","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5815903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dexter M.
