The two friends, Jeremy and Luca, are different, yet are united through their mutual friendship with Alonzo. I am trying to convey the reality of being 'torn apart' through this film; showing that two many moving parts of someones life can cause a strain, and later a tear.","popularity":0.1143,"poster_path":"/coQmiYkOpMl1t5BftOoYOoXH9PP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":279545,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sue8de","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fishbone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5387636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santosh
