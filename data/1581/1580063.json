Set in in a world where cloud storage has been decommissioned by international agreement to address wasteful energy practices, and new hard drives are no longer in production, all that's left to archive precious memories are the old hard drives already in circulation.  In this new reality of storage scarcity, personal hard drives must be decluttered continuously by ‘hard drive swimmers' according to the owner's ReadMe.txt. The film follows characters facing a dilemma presented by a hard drive left behind with vague instructions.  Clara's Hard Drive combines still photographs, stop motion, 3D animation (Nikos Kourous Vázquez), live music, and existing  home video to build a world around a hard drive that was gifted to the filmmaker by their friend, Clara Boulard. The resulting project is a collaborative exploration of outsourced memory, trust, and tenderness.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lAMq9tLf3vt77Cy1GCUORg7q9zF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clara's Hard Drive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5814648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Bourthoumieux","original_name":"Charles Bourthoumieux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6915d67ceacffe65b23a411a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5814649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Kourous Vasquez","original_name":"Sofia Kourous Vasquez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6915d68c0041954608a0de8d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5814650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikos Kourous Vasquez","original_name":"Nikos Kourous Vasquez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6915d6b3540af423d04c96ed","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5814651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oona","original_name":"Oona","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6915d6c22ea0461e539c51a0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5814646,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosemary Moss","original_name":"Rosemary Moss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6915d5af95aa21afb7a0dd74","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5814647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serena Mirambeau","original_name":"Serena Mirambeau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6915d5c29b2ed4e73f9c514e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lAMq9tLf3vt77Cy1GCUORg7q9zF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":357272,"name":"sci-fi"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
