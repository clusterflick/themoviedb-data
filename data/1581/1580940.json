When he learns that the leader of the group, oarsman Buck Simmons, is also winning the favor of Aida Courtlandt, the dean's niece, the jealous Browning and gambler Burton Hampdon, to whom Browning owes money, attempt to disgrace Buck so he will not be allowed to participate in the upcoming Yale-Harvard race. After they fail to lure Buck to bed with a girl, Browning takes Aida to a roadhouse so that Buck will have to break training rules to go there. When the coach, suspicious about the roadhouse incident, finds a letter planted on Buck about a deal for him to throw the race, he suspends Buck, but with Aida's influence, the dean straightens matters out. After Yale wins a close race, Browning shoots at Buck, who then trounces him. Proclaimed captain of the next year's team, Buck becomes engaged to Aida.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6t06agSpwwIswsPSk2OnqjXRHnj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Winning Stroke","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":633744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Walsh","original_name":"George Walsh","popularity":0.1028,"profile_path":"/hLkVjr3BHI9FyBI2I1vqWr6s3NB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Buck Simmons","credit_id":"6917ae60dfa0d78076876b52","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5817785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane McAlpine","original_name":"Jane McAlpine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Aida Courtlandt","credit_id":"6917ae9ac0b23dcca8ac2b4b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5817789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Leslie","original_name":"John Leslie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Paul Browning","credit_id":"6917aeaf57e51d6fe73a4b17","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2981756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William T.
