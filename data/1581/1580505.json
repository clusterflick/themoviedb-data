It was crucial for them to keep a track of the rhythm of the major drum leader of Senegal and they organized in the Island of Gnor a concert that this film restores us. Under the small amphitheater made of stone, the great virtuoso give us to see and listen to a great moment of joy because Doudou N'Diaye Rose dances as much as he drums. And for the fifty percussionists and one hundred members of the Julien Jouge's church choir, this is also the celebration of the bodies.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Djabote, Doudou N'Diaye Rose","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18766908","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
