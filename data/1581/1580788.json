With no fixed itinerary and no certainty about where they will sleep, they ride along, lulled by the road, their encounters, and simple pleasures. Between camping under the stars, impromptu feasts, and mountain adventures, they finally reach the summit... before taking off in paragliders. Along the way, they discover pure freedom, where riding is enough to make them happy.
