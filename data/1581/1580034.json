The film places the historic Flight of Five locks on the Erie Canal in Lockport, New York, squarely in the American narrative as a symbol of a young and developing nation. The Lockport Locks were regarded as a modern engineering marvel at the time that the Erie Canal was originally opened in 1825. They enabled water-borne commerce and passengers to travel from New York City to the Great Lakes via the Hudson River and the man-made inland waterway system, opening up the Midwest to development.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"America's Stairway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2862860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Lamont","original_name":"Paul Lamont","popularity":0.0919,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6915abdf9cdeac55348763d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
