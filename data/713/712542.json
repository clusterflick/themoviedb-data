A performer enters, and the viewer realizes that the camera is placed  above the scene looking back in space toward the floor. The performer brings in fluorescent light tubes and places them on the floor horizontally near the bottom of the screen. This positioning corresponds to the foreground in the filmed scene  The lights appear to be black since white is black in negative.
