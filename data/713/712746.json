Almost a million stateless people now amass in makeshift refugee camps, their survival banking entirely on humanitarian aid from international organizations like the UN's World Food Programme. \"One Life\" takes a cinematic journey following eight-year-old Nur Kalima as she adapts to life in the world's largest refugee camp. Moving from the individual to the global stage, the film delves into the ever-larger powers holding the fates of Nur and the rest of the Rohingya in their hands.","popularity":0.0784,"poster_path":"/2i2COwU9II6rRd6kdM598sL8OOp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Life","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Josh Turnbow","original_name":"Josh Turnbow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eda666196e30b0022985e3a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9605888","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2i2COwU9II6rRd6kdM598sL8OOp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
