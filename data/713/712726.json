Birds, and ducks in particular, are like role models for humans— they find ways to survive by various means across varied terrain. I hope to bring together a mix of local birds and migratory ones, migrating across different generations of  moving image media.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/yYeGmEQ5uCaevpn3KwAemHEkwEe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A child dies, a child plays, a woman is born, a woman dies, a bird arrives, a bird flies off","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272627,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shireen Seno","original_name":"Shireen Seno","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/8HsXoJs52JxJirWicKUAXROa2bO.jpg","credit_id":"5eda53562f3b170020562aee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yYeGmEQ5uCaevpn3KwAemHEkwEe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":567}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arcade 4walls edition, 18 min, color, HD.
