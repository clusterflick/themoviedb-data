Juxtaposing \"documentary\" takes on a fashion shoot with footage of semiologist Sylvère Lotringer giving an impromptu lecture on Mallarmé on a frozen lake, Hell Frozen Over maintains an ambiguous stance from which to both critique and celebrate the power of surface.","popularity":0.2143,"poster_path":"/IvzxIan5jzx1w8a5rZCgWhLPnz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135101,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Bohen
