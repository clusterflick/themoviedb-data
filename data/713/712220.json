Created over 7 years out of thousands of charcoal drawings, the animation weaves both texts together and explores the spirit of place to take you on a journey from West Africa to the Thames in London and the Rhine in Germany. It has themes of moonlight, oceans, rivers, unexplored territory, mythological symbolism and highlights concerns for the environment. Our guides on the journey are Hermes, a grey seal, and Pegasus, the winged horse, they are both unconstrained by the straight jacket of time.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/fUZwNORVfNTJkErlskZzQV9hORe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Masque of Blackness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2278408,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Epoh Beech","original_name":"Epoh Beech","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed82df096e30b002295f75c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1029,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fUZwNORVfNTJkErlskZzQV9hORe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":686}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
