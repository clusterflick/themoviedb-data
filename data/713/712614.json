During the Middle Ages between Christmas and Epiphany, everything was turned topsy-turvy. The poor could mock the rich, the humble could deride the powerful. A “fool’s pope” was elected and one could disguised himself as a bull, a cow, a deer or other pagan divinities. In New Orleans, the carnival has preserved this sense of liberty. Suddenly, everything is permitted, even the most absurd extravagance.","popularity":0.119,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1965-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carnaval Nouvelle-Orléans","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1146725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Reichenbach","original_name":"François Reichenbach","popularity":0.1163,"profile_path":"/vvhbUSypqTRHgAcrPbHq6HtY0uz.jpg","credit_id":"5ed9e9461b157d001e595e23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
