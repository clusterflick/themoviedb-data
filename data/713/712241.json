This has made it impossible to cultivate the soil and raise livestock, a form of livelihood for local families. Member of one of these families, Ruivaldo Nery Andrade, our guide character, struggles to save his farm, through the construction of a manual system of dikes to contain and alter the course of invading waters and, thus, resume his activities and guarantee the survival of the land.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/1MuGMSIGwtCpmPSyrFMIywONCtU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2019-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruivaldo, O Homem que Salvou a Terra","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruivaldo Nery de Andrade","original_name":"Ruivaldo Nery de Andrade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ed84787e4b576001e34edbb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Farkas","original_name":"João Farkas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed8473d96e30b0020963c24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Bodanzky","original_name":"Jorge Bodanzky","popularity":0.0665,"profile_path":"/w01npJr3kIhsSeKFyCWrCi9J3EH.jpg","credit_id":"5ed846ef8ddc34001fda9768","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1827109,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mônica Guimarães","original_name":"Mônica Guimarães","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f346b8464f7160036a4af21","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2076983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruna Callegari","original_name":"Bruna Callegari","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f346b7864f7160035a4bfaa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2076983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruna Callegari","original_name":"Bruna Callegari","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f346b735f622b0036641b55","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11350702","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1MuGMSIGwtCpmPSyrFMIywONCtU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":663}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
