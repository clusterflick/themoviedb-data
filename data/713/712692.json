Calavera Highway (Skeleton Highway), traces the odyssey of two brothers as they decipher their family's story-why their mother ROSA was outcast by her own family, and what happened to their father PEDRO, who disappeared during the notorious 1954 U.S. government deportation program, \"Operation Wetback,\" in which over a million Mexican and Mexican Americans were forced across the border. A sweeping story of a family of seven men grappling with the meaning of masculinity, fatherhood, and a legacy of rootless beginnings.","popularity":0.0662,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Calavera Highway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1042320,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Renee Tajima-Peña","original_name":"Renee Tajima-Peña","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eda420596e30b0022983ec2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1090307","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
