As the fastest aging country in the world, which also severely limits immigration, Japan finds itself undergoing a depopulation that has led to the shrinking of some communities. Speculating on a \"post-society\" landscape where the natural world is taking over, the causal links between industrialized society and fragile eco-systems finds parallels in our sudden dramatic awareness of nature’s autonomy, as the presumption of our ability to maintain and control the natural world comes under question.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xFA3z1BYmJbksz5TIjbFCqO1P81.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Extinguishment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuki Higashino","original_name":"Yuki Higashino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Voice (Japanese)","credit_id":"5ed8617f1b157d001e57af99","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Kihlström","original_name":"Elisabeth Kihlström","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Voice (English)","credit_id":"5ed861a91b157d001e57afaf","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuki Higashino","original_name":"Yuki Higashino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed861223a99370020559177","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuki Higashino","original_name":"Yuki Higashino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed8608021c4ca0020eb8614","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuki Higashino","original_name":"Yuki Higashino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed8603d1b157d001f5ae91e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2547162,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexander Martinez","original_name":"Alexander Martinez","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed8614421c4ca001fe2c889","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2665093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuki Higashino","original_name":"Yuki Higashino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed8604e21c4ca001fe2c7f8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xFA3z1BYmJbksz5TIjbFCqO1P81.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
