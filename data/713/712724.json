Stuart Hall was able to interview him for Channel 4 in the UK . The interview discusses his thoughts on revolution, socialism, and politics. His involvement in activism lasted decades. Born in Trinidad, much of his life was spent in the UK. C.R.L James became a teacher and notably taught Eric Williams. Williams went on to lead Trinidad and Tabago to independence. C.L.R. James also wrote fiction and about cricket. During his youth he did play the sport and wrote Beyond a Boundary (1963) describing cricketâ€™s cultural significance. One of his favorite novels was Vanity Fair. This novel followed the lives of Becky Sharp and Amelia Sedley during the Napoleonic Wars. James was a figure in the Pan-African movement and the anti-colonial freedom struggle. What tends to be ignored is his concern about class exploitation.","popularity":0.0656,"poster_path":"/850wsbdYxWhOyMkJUaZXlec7OmT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CLR James Talking to Stuart Hall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2934644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Hall","original_name":"Stuart Hall","popularity":0.1164,"profile_path":"/7oh4Fm32o7ZgyCghSFArZuXSx4X.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6319030654a8ac0099f970a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2666744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"C.L.R.
