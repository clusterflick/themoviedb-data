From 1995-2001 there were fifteen black men killed by the Cincinnati police.  The film focuses on two of those murders, Roger Owensby, Jr and Timothy Thomas.  Martin Luther King said that “A riot is the cry of the unheard.”  Thomas's death sparked three days of civil unrest and protests.  This poignant and powerful story of injustice is told through news reports, first-person accounts and cinema verité footage of the surviving families' long-suffering battle for justice.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tYsNa3Lawv4TYunBKglQv6zjEt9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This documentary is about police brutality, institutional racism, and the power of grassroots activism in Cincinnati, Ohio.","title":"Cincinnati Goddamn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1955501,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Paul Hill","original_name":"Paul Hill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed7f5c01b157d001f5a5540","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2664789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"April Martin","original_name":"April Martin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed7f5a196e30b002095cad6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4286704","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tYsNa3Lawv4TYunBKglQv6zjEt9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
