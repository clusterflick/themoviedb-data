Most of the men and women are asylum-seekers. They have little idea where they are and have nothing more than the clothes on their backs. Welcome Strangers is a short documentary that tells the story of Sarah Jackson, a young woman who searches the streets for these immigrants and invites them into her home. She is assisted by Oliver, the lead host, and over a thousand volunteers as they provide hospitality and help reunite the guests with their families.","popularity":0.0459,"poster_path":"/jfeh6RQDcYBsV4IyKFOgxQ2w7A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welcome Strangers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1620526,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dia Sokol Savage","original_name":"Dia Sokol Savage","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed8f84121c4ca001fe32d3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100476,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Garret Savage","original_name":"Garret Savage","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed8f84e21c4ca001fe32d4d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2665592,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chelsea Jackson","original_name":"Chelsea Jackson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/oLHWdPMSDVisRCieyGmiBsgvbPm.jpg","credit_id":"5ed8f85de4b5760020398a80","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morgan J.
