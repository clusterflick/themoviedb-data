He is fierce and drives terrible deeds, but he is also the Divine Protector and Supreme Guardian; his intention springs from pure compassion. In this work, carried by a strong and deeply evocative musical score and by the singular energy of the ancient site of Hampi, dancer and choreographer Shantala Shivalingappa embodies the presence and distinctive qualities of Bhairava. With her technical mastery and refined expressivity, she alternates between moments of precise symbolic gestures and more abstract body language surging from the powerful and omnipresent persona of Bhairava, creating a vivid incarnation of the deity.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/jZDZUBZy19rWdwmLIuHl4Y9aNmD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135126,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mouvement Perpétuel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bhairava","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2666374,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shantala Shivalingappa","original_name":"Shantala Shivalingappa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"5ed9bdaa700bf70020580cc1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2666378,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"B.
