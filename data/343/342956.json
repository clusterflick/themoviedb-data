But Lea, now in her mid-20s, is starting to break away from her dominant mother. In this difficult and conflicting time between mother and daughter, Lea suddenly falls ill with multiple sclerosis. In Ruth, a terrible suspicion begins to germinate: Lea may have been poisoned by intensive contact with solvents in the printing house where she has a student job. When Ruth voices her fear, the company turns on the works attorney Robert. He turns out to be Ruth's old childhood sweetheart.","popularity":0.3416,"poster_path":"/xqfBlxI4OeBkeDfp4Q1RdgxOlXG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meine Tochter, mein Leben","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thekla Carola Wied","original_name":"Thekla Carola Wied","popularity":0.2301,"profile_path":"/7ltQ1oueNva0sZgPEHcQHu9X1es.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ruth Lorentz","credit_id":"556ee436c3a3684a60001407","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chiara Schoras","original_name":"Chiara Schoras","popularity":0.1423,"profile_path":"/dSv6J5w0SD2P84Tv2xwQ2mdKQHt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lea Lorentz","credit_id":"556ee444c3a3684796001491","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Mendl","original_name":"Michael Mendl","popularity":0.2585,"profile_path":"/3RrIh45zEvRtyq9kG6qyh52a2I8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Robert Sturm","credit_id":"556ee4539251414220002b3c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Peach","original_name":"Timothy Peach","popularity":0.1661,"profile_path":"/og3ImGqoxz2s8ljpYRo7eaZ9bpW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Seelbender","credit_id":"556ee498c3a3680e7a0027cc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthias Koeberlin","original_name":"Matthias Koeberlin","popularity":0.2365,"profile_path":"/c8NeOISGKyT3cmk16qOZWPvbZ8R.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Björn Reschke","credit_id":"56046bf0c3a368552b006089","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirsten Block","original_name":"Kirsten Block","popularity":0.3165,"profile_path":"/e1gl6JMgedhLKVh1THHpVaevQ8V.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Beate Grüning","credit_id":"56046bfbc3a3685526006594","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Davor","original_name":"Peter Davor","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":"/axAtzw8iJISbQQIMXnPQc1bnrXN.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Peter Weiland","credit_id":"56046c09c3a36855410059a9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":571170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renate Geißler","original_name":"Renate Geißler","popularity":0.1911,"profile_path":"/rGdAlu9veh9wr9SJmODAUbNltZY.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ina Rabenalt","credit_id":"567ff4209251411334004992","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1391306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrich Wiggers","original_name":"Ulrich Wiggers","popularity":0.1308,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Thomas Rauchfuß","credit_id":"5b4b14010e0a264544021fde","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1326736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ursula Staack","original_name":"Ursula Staack","popularity":0.0872,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Gudrun Fischer","credit_id":"5b4b143ec3a36823e6024cba","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1324484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Günter Barton","original_name":"Günter Barton","popularity":0.1342,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Dr. Klausen","credit_id":"5b4b144e9251417d1e01f8de","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":292198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bodo Fürneisen","original_name":"Bodo Fürneisen","popularity":0.1489,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"556ee41f925141421d0029f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0412013","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/tKgcQfDTzfIDc4iVsj8xWZiI6hj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/xqfBlxI4OeBkeDfp4Q1RdgxOlXG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
