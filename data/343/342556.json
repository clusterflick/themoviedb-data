She informs the police, but initially ends up with a corrupt policeman who lulls her into a false sense of security, but in reality has been working with the man who hired her for some time. Her life is in grave danger, but the policeman is reluctant to eliminate the witness, especially as he has fallen in love.","popularity":0.4797,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1478,"logo_path":"/plHEkpGkULYqiLRpYsUak8uYmhU.png","name":"Sat.1","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1704,"logo_path":"/sb3PuMTgJgpPUY7x634etBAhodu.png","name":"Bavaria Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1999-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Tod in deinen Augen","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Kretschmann","original_name":"Thomas Kretschmann","popularity":1.3002,"profile_path":"/p1XYiekXjaUxHMztBALrez1Ud4J.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Billy Tanauer","credit_id":"556af26192514164cd000e77","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aglaia Szyszkowitz","original_name":"Aglaia Szyszkowitz","popularity":0.2227,"profile_path":"/8Jju93UvSPszRzZ9Glvjp9z2anF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Laura Tillmann","credit_id":"556af27192514164cd000e7c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Horwitz","original_name":"Dominique Horwitz","popularity":0.2133,"profile_path":"/3YuwwLvwuDjl6R9RnBQ03A6vp3R.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Leo Lohmann","credit_id":"556af28092514174a8003660","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Kreye","original_name":"Walter Kreye","popularity":0.3081,"profile_path":"/JtzOVZZMiRvsyWoJgNRPaqf0ei.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Helmut Reiger","credit_id":"556af28ec3a36825d5001307","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manfred Lehmann","original_name":"Manfred Lehmann","popularity":0.297,"profile_path":"/tvrQfgKdn5k5552RpPlqeCWPVFu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"556af298c3a36826f8001410","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52041,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Rowitz","original_name":"Michael Rowitz","popularity":0.1719,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"556af249c3a368254b0015e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1449856,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Oliver Schündler","original_name":"Oliver Schündler","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6659d1e32f924e7400941de6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":45656,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Angelika Sengbusch","original_name":"Angelika Sengbusch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6659d21874c0ec3c06286d36","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4746787,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Benjamin Parment","original_name":"Benjamin Parment","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6659d1c951725b351b941f27","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":52294,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dietmar Koelzer","original_name":"Dietmar Koelzer","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6659d2002004bb194f2d6313","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":50225,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jürgen Ecke","original_name":"Jürgen Ecke","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6659d20c730856fd3ba3ef3c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1123881,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael January","original_name":"Michael January","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6659d1b72004bb194f2d630c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2546179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Veres","original_name":"James Veres","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674d78d475cd01706a7cdab2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0191565","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
