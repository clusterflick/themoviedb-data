It isn't until she's approached  by a mysterious stranger that her luck may change... for the worse; a typical night of work for a librarian  becomes a classic ghost story with a modern twist. Sometimes you can't keep a bad book down; Sidney  is allowed to stay after hours to study for a test. It's not until she suddenly awakens in the darkened library  that she realizes the horrifying truth of what lurks among the stacks of books after midnight. She better  pray she doesn't become the prey; Paige faces regrets that she'd do anything to take back. When an  ancient and arcane spell book literally falls into her lap, she decides to make a grave decision. Be careful  what you wish for, it might just kill you.","popularity":1.8551,"poster_path":"/zPb7jWuaRQ3PxyXe9LHgDWSseNP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124496,"logo_path":null,"name":"Verite Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some libraries make a killing!","title":"Volumes of Blood","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3559240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Clark","original_name":"Kevin Clark","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/gAtV9yX1OotlG8WfiOFVbZwEoJf.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Rod the Bod","credit_id":"6289bf116c84922f757012a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandria Hendrick","original_name":"Alexandria Hendrick","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6289bf1fe267de0067828199","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3559241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wes Johnson","original_name":"Wes Johnson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6289bf2fe267de00678281d5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1960444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerrimy Keiffer","original_name":"Gerrimy Keiffer","popularity":0.1079,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6289bf46e267de0067828210","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2813131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Todd Reynolds","original_name":"Todd Reynolds","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6289bfa26c84922f76f76d28","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1960463,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"P.J.
