Electrodomésticos was the band that leaded this resistance, more occupied with bringing the repressed Chile closer with new artistic tendencies of the world than to adhere to a specific political discourse. Within this context, at the beginning of the 1980s artists Silvio Paredes and Ernesto Medina begin experimenting with sounds as inventive as running blenders, Casiotones and recordings from local radio stations. In 1984, they meet an air traffic controller of common interest, Carlos Cabezas, with whom they form a band so groundbreaking it sounded like nothing ever done before.","popularity":0.0669,"poster_path":"/hZpPuC806x4Iqpn4sMhZCcmT4Tg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2010-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Electrodomésticos: El frío misterio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1393595,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlos Cabezas","original_name":"Carlos Cabezas","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e7e8179688cd00018347fdc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836673,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Silvio Paredes","original_name":"Silvio Paredes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fa86a2bc68b69003da44b8f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1425014,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergio Castro San Martín","original_name":"Sergio Castro San Martín","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa868ad81383100409add76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/hZpPuC806x4Iqpn4sMhZCcmT4Tg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
