He uses his ingenuity to uncover the mystery. Cubby and his girlfriend go underground and create a crop of synthetic vegetables in their underground cave-factory, then force them upward through the soil. An evil clothes-wearing opossum conspires to steal the entire load of vegetables in his pickup truck, but Cubby's worm friend tips them off. Cubby bombs the opossum with a pineapple, blowing him sky-high. Beans, peas, and other assorted objects take on lives and personalities of their own.","popularity":0.1127,"poster_path":"/nlm1HnriLjUlmSHjnDJ75mE9iM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7515,"logo_path":null,"name":"Van Beuren Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How's Crops","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Brownie's Victory Garden","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148258,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vernon Stallings","original_name":"Vernon Stallings","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":"/uiho47tq19hRJemmfXDxzL4GoEp.jpg","credit_id":"5569b60dc3a368774e001717","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0148318","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nlm1HnriLjUlmSHjnDJ75mE9iM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1934-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
