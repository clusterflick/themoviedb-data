Desperate to be someone in life---and to pay off his debts---he embarks on a journey into the increasingly magnetic world of Evangelical Christianity. Religion seems to offer a quick path to becoming rich and soon Gonzalez is willing to do anything in his power in order to make it happen. A thriller that evokes the gritty style of Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver, Gonzalez: The False Prophet is a suspenseful ride through the darker side of charismatic preachers and upstart religions that flourish on the hard-earned money of desperate people in need of hope.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"González: El Falso Profeta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
