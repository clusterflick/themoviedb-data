Schaller's lovely and sometimes deeply emotional, 63-minute journal/essay film offers a look at the making of the Wausau, Wisconsin classic, including interviews with the one surviving cast member and the relatives of others who appeared in the movie.","popularity":0.0516,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When You Wore a Tulip and I Wore a Big Red Rose","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1473099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Schaller","original_name":"Stephen Schaller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"556d0dd7c3a36811f6000450","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3898592","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
