Shot in a piecemeal fashion between 1966 and 1969 and plagued with production problems, this film never completed principal photography and never entered post-production. The original negatives are now considered to be lost, and the film only exists in two incomplete workprint versions (one color and one black-and-white), which have received isolated public screenings since 2007.","popularity":0.477,"poster_path":"/dryWvXlAJx3xbhZTlcCQoeOewUk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
