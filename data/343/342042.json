He tells Mickey how he can't get close to the girl of his dreams; he's overheard by Dave, a smooth operator, who insists that Alabam leave everything to him. He contrives to have Alabam and Mickey wreck Alabam's car in the girl's front yard, then he arrives, posing as a doctor, asking the residents of the house if they'll let the injured boy come inside while the doctor examines him. Meanwhile, Mickey gets a look at the girl's cousin and feigns injury so that now both lads are in beds upstairs while Dave, the doctor, conjures foul-tasting treatments. The fly in the ointment is the girl's crusty uncle, who may stand between the lads and their true loves.","popularity":0.4915,"poster_path":"/8JwPQoG3K55v8yavGyPK1FDVYNg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doctor's Orders","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Sharpe","original_name":"David Sharpe","popularity":0.2479,"profile_path":"/n8AaxxHG0ocOBV3uPm0zuuHoz0x.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dave / Dr. Sharpe / Nurse","credit_id":"5565f78e9251413549001dfc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1000932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrude Messinger","original_name":"Gertrude Messinger","popularity":0.1055,"profile_path":"/1gmJg3HQotI8BIxa2bXTBhHN6YI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gertie","credit_id":"5565f798925141354c001d00","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Kornman","original_name":"Mary Kornman","popularity":0.1101,"profile_path":"/xl7dNI3feY6Mv3Xyxr2JA9iQuAM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"5565f7a7c3a3687ad9001da0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Daniels","original_name":"Mickey Daniels","popularity":0.1889,"profile_path":"/kYS1wlzxNiRq7oZf9w9f8Sdd6y7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mickey","credit_id":"5565f7b0925141353d001bde","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Granger","original_name":"Dorothy Granger","popularity":0.2115,"profile_path":"/3iNHKiEQ0wx2bTYMzG2YdRz28HK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dorothy, the Maid","credit_id":"5565f7b9c3a3687ac2001d90","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grady Sutton","original_name":"Grady Sutton","popularity":0.1963,"profile_path":"/tNvIf1ATZiZJCrO7lkI056yK1zp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Alabam","credit_id":"5565f7c3925141354c001d07","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Kennedy","original_name":"Edgar Kennedy","popularity":0.1961,"profile_path":"/oA8h7AdAUZYg5uO0xzFMQOkc9DQ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mary's Father / Gertie's Uncle","credit_id":"5565f7cd9251413546001d77","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1362713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Mae Crane","original_name":"Betty Mae Crane","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Introductory Titles Speaker","credit_id":"5565f7d5c3a3687ac500211a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beverly Crane","original_name":"Beverly Crane","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Introductory Titles Speaker","credit_id":"5565f7e09251413549001e01","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiny Sandford","original_name":"Tiny Sandford","popularity":0.232,"profile_path":"/dsfbvZOIb1rdBx8eUGa2QTYyqGE.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Cop","credit_id":"5565f7e99251413543001c87","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1429806,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arch Heath","original_name":"Arch Heath","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5565f74dc3a3683c0f001c06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131383,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"H.M.
