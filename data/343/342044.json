Alabam suggests that his uncle might hire Dave at a department store. The uncle likes Dave's attitude and tells Alabam and Mickey they should work there too. Reluctantly, Alabam takes a sales assignment in ladies' accessories, where he's charming but clueless. Mickey, lazy and on the take, sees the store detective helping himself to a chocolate bar, so he wants that job. Dave learns the hard way that the customer is always right, Mickey puts the cuffs on the wrong customer, and Lake Arrowhead looks very far away.","popularity":0.4488,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1930-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bigger and Better","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mickey Daniels","original_name":"Mickey Daniels","popularity":0.1889,"profile_path":"/kYS1wlzxNiRq7oZf9w9f8Sdd6y7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mickey Daniels","credit_id":"5565fd14c3a3687acf001eaf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grady Sutton","original_name":"Grady Sutton","popularity":0.1963,"profile_path":"/tNvIf1ATZiZJCrO7lkI056yK1zp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Grady 'Alabam' Sutton","credit_id":"5565fd1e925141354f001d2b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Sharpe","original_name":"David Sharpe","popularity":0.2479,"profile_path":"/n8AaxxHG0ocOBV3uPm0zuuHoz0x.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dave Sharpe","credit_id":"5565fd2a9251413543001d03","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Kornman","original_name":"Mary Kornman","popularity":0.1101,"profile_path":"/xl7dNI3feY6Mv3Xyxr2JA9iQuAM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"5565fd37c3a3687acf001eb2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Granger","original_name":"Dorothy Granger","popularity":0.2115,"profile_path":"/3iNHKiEQ0wx2bTYMzG2YdRz28HK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dorothy","credit_id":"5565fd409251413540001dfe","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1000932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrude Messinger","original_name":"Gertrude Messinger","popularity":0.1055,"profile_path":"/1gmJg3HQotI8BIxa2bXTBhHN6YI.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gertie","credit_id":"5565fd49c3a3687acf001eb7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1362713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Mae Crane","original_name":"Betty Mae Crane","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Introductory Titles","credit_id":"5565fd53c3a3687ade001e8c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beverly Crane","original_name":"Beverly Crane","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Introductory Titles","credit_id":"5565fd5c9251413543001d0b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Forte","original_name":"Joseph Forte","popularity":0.117,"profile_path":"/oekO9k6QNowKRd1PVs7n5ruac2W.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Store Detective","credit_id":"5565fd70925141353d001c76","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Granger","original_name":"Dick Granger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Minor Role","credit_id":"5565fd7b925141354c001daa","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1471128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Granger","original_name":"Jim Granger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Minor Role","credit_id":"5565fd839251413549001e88","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dell Henderson","original_name":"Dell Henderson","popularity":0.2378,"profile_path":"/gA4BPbRHPSvI16n1QcRlAd3gmSo.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mr. Kornman","credit_id":"5565fd8fc3a3687ad7001ccc","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Keith","original_name":"Isabelle Keith","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/w7smwshGFGuDG3lHO8WYf6KhHVn.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Mrs. Vanderveer","credit_id":"5565fd9a925141353a001ead","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Kennedy","original_name":"Edgar Kennedy","popularity":0.1961,"profile_path":"/oA8h7AdAUZYg5uO0xzFMQOkc9DQ.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Uncle Ed Sutton","credit_id":"5565fda3c3a3687ad7001ccf","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1353645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl M.
