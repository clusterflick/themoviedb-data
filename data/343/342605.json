Playing in theaters in 1941-42, only a few years after the Man of Steel made his debut in Action Comics, these 17 exciting films were produced by Fleischer and made famous the phrase \"This looks like a job for Superman!\" At 10 minutes, each film had just enough time to run the opening credits, establish the threat, let Lois Lane make a headstrong rush into peril, and allow Clark Kent to change to his alter ego and save the day. The films show a remarkably dynamic and atmospheric storytelling style that enables them to hold up for modern viewers. At first the films followed a science fiction-fantasy theme, but not unexpectedly for that time soon focused on wartime concerns.","popularity":0.7428,"poster_path":"/fqwlHx8FXeUHQGqC8K1cp5hY4F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is a job for Superman!","title":"Max Fleischer's Superman 1941-1942","video":true,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Superman: The Fleischer Cartoons","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"超人","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":214193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bud Collyer","original_name":"Bud Collyer","popularity":0.126,"profile_path":"/4MQxyzMCBZpANBU7STDU1QGsfmG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Superman / Clark Kent (voice) (archive sound)","credit_id":"56e32ccb9251416d430009d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":560295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Alexander","original_name":"Joan Alexander","popularity":0.1307,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Lois Lane (voice) (archive sound)","credit_id":"67dd4b541cda1dbb467a745b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":606084,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Max Fleischer","original_name":"Max Fleischer","popularity":0.14,"profile_path":"/m4i8FwtAeh3u1J01cdFsCf0G6VB.jpg","credit_id":"67dd4b62c70acdd9df69898f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Fleischer","original_name":"Dave Fleischer","popularity":0.3152,"profile_path":"/wSsZ2FuFstd6Ed0D6h94TwYlVuq.jpg","credit_id":"67dd4b7b1fee87c1bc7a6df8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":"","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iHfEGHg5c2urlG82tuRIQA9k1hq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1QdOkEAJDMl6VIhvNzwYBEDfM9F.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.489,"height":233,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2HeEPNozrtQOEyV3yrKcZRM5GgT.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1515,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fqwlHx8FXeUHQGqC8K1cp5hY4F.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":1010},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/64J0XTuIRSkiBVRvfCwfWDdceZj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6513,"name":"cartoon"},{"id":33637,"name":"super power"},{"id":190200,"name":"short compilation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
