Brigadier, who doesn't like being mistaken for a dog, doesn't believe in the authenticity of the jewels. Then, discovering the owner, he introduces Fernand to the big wide world. Ghislaine Lafont-Dubreuilh, the daughter of the found jewels, sure of her fiancé, whom she neglects, is only concerned with the tramp's future. Her introduction to politics, boxing and wrestling leads to as many failures for the tramp as successes for Fernand Raynaud in his repertoire. Finally, the tramp becomes chaplinesque, restoring the fiancé to his belle's heart and taking only the English chambermaid on the road.","popularity":0.3407,"poster_path":"/lowPsZF1G5nDu01bYC1oLZDTCQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54544,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jeannic
