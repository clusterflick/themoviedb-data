It only contains a barman, a man and a beautiful woman who lives in a bathroom. For commercial reasons, we have included two policemen, a drop of blood and a multilingual nymphomaniac. For aesthetic reasons, a tear and a negro. For both reasons, the film takes place anachronically, during the fifties and nineties in a make-believe city called Caracas. It's a story of histerics, like all stories, unfinished.","popularity":0.0513,"poster_path":"/djKCF85CIfqiUi1RIZU7DMZfC7B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Departamento de Cine de la Universidad de los
