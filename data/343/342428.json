Little things thwart him: Maxine the maid makes noise, Sonny, a lad in the household, makes a mess, and Henry's wife wants the car for shopping. A newly arrived friend, Bert, suggests that Henry fake his own death, don a disguise and appear as Bert's English valet, and skulk about. They'll mourn and the truth can later be revealed. Sonny hears the entire plan and alerts Henry's wife and the rest of the household. Only Maxine is in the dark. Henry's wife gives the valet an attic room, throws herself in his arms, complains about her late husband, and sends Henry into a tizzy. He and Bert set up a s√©ance to try to fix their ruse.","popularity":0.3392,"poster_path":"/yzQGeBi1aqE9kWqQWjyOQfO2K3C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1936-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Live Ghost","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Errol","original_name":"Leon Errol","popularity":0.1492,"profile_path":"/8jV6d5rKmmXn69TRbm4Ndehdrpr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Henry Morton / Philpot (valet) / Ghost of Henry Morton","credit_id":"5569dedcc3a36875ef0014b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucille Ball","original_name":"Lucille Ball","popularity":0.9088,"profile_path":"/HpqB6dUz4eqZnOjk5xEuHCvp5Y.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Maxine","credit_id":"5569dee792514173e0001629","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":80648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivien Oakland","original_name":"Vivien Oakland","popularity":0.242,"profile_path":"/jShxUZ2SxscXXVwLCQe6y7G6AnV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ethel Morton","credit_id":"5569def2c3a36875ef0014b8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Graves","original_name":"Robert Graves","popularity":0.0883,"profile_path":"/etz3P6QUZiSXaguWbsVRPNBQMhl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bert","credit_id":"5569deff92514173e000162e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delmar Watson","original_name":"Delmar Watson","popularity":0.2003,"profile_path":"/zvQfnB9FepYMBbryCZX1T5FRLNb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sonny","credit_id":"5569df0892514173b30017a1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Curtis","original_name":"Alan Curtis","popularity":0.1359,"profile_path":"/AfJi9skVbom6EgeqUY76nFjxq1W.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Alan","credit_id":"5569df13c3a3685489001a48","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Kerr","original_name":"Donald Kerr","popularity":0.2895,"profile_path":"/g59FziDjwnUQFiYLJR4MFSP2OMY.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Chauffeur","credit_id":"5569df1c92514173f5001709","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Goodwins","original_name":"Leslie Goodwins","popularity":0.2818,"profile_path":"/oPBTBFXVdoQrkxfNB4Q3vyQvli9.jpg","credit_id":"5569de8b9251416b04001b45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Goodwins","original_name":"Leslie Goodwins","popularity":0.2818,"profile_path":"/oPBTBFXVdoQrkxfNB4Q3vyQvli9.jpg","credit_id":"61aabf0d6c1e0400829db043","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monte Collins","original_name":"Monte Collins","popularity":0.1436,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61aabf1b8efe730041f16c82","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0174092","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p54skd63RUdlM58Zj382e5WC7pY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yzQGeBi1aqE9kWqQWjyOQfO2K3C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1936-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
