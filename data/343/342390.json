It celebrates the relationship of a people to the land that they occupy and cultivate and places high esteem on the virtues of the bucolic (as opposed to urban) living.  From this propaganda film, we learn, how hard it is to be a peasant when liberals rule the state. A family of peasants is forced to sell their property and run away to a big city, where they are forced to live in the poverty. Thankfully when the Nazis take power, they may finally come back and live a happy life.  Besides the main plot, there is also educational elements here: Germans are informed how few of them will remain in 2050 year if they don't start a mass reproduction.","popularity":0.1331,"poster_path":"/vsz0fPlj0FazD3OFpixF2s6tWBZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147057,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stabsamt des Reichsbauernf√ºhrers","origin_country":""},{"id":147058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hauptabteilung Werburg","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1933-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blood and Soil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Blood and Soil","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1472019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Berghaus","original_name":"Heinz Berghaus","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"556985bb9251416b0a001395","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl de Vogt","original_name":"Carl de Vogt","popularity":0.0993,"profile_path":"/3vTyDyjn1Py82xSs3ng1qsL0cT9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"556985c4c3a368774e0011e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1197289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herta Scheel","original_name":"Herta Scheel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"556985cec3a36876980010ec","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1472020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jakob Sinn","original_name":"Jakob Sinn","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"556985d8c3a36876bd000f1a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1472021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Stock","original_name":"Hans Stock","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"556985e59251416b040012f3","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2798,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Ruttmann","original_name":"Walter Ruttmann","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":"/tadF9CxIFsJMTMhyPRWtgDqBzsi.jpg","credit_id":"556985789251416afc00136c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1472018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans von Passavant","original_name":"Hans von Passavant","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5569858d92514173e0000e13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":577225,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rolf von Sonjevski-Jamrowski","original_name":"Rolf von Sonjevski-Jamrowski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5569859c92514173b3000fa3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0442003","wikidata_id":"Q30715530","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1458,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vsz0fPlj0FazD3OFpixF2s6tWBZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":972}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1933-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
