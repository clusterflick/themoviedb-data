A man (favourite actor Wang Shin-hong) meets a woman (standard actor Wu Ke-xi) on a moored ship, a sort of floating palace decorated like a Buddhist temple. The woman or her spirit struggles with her memories and the man takes on the form of a Buddhist monk in his next life. Complex and yet simple. The man, the woman and the camera move gracefully 'dancing' through the space. Only the thought of escape.","popularity":0.0701,"poster_path":"/r357gvqwKJlljx5DyN05nEjlOB8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Palace on the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","title":"海上皇宮","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"THE PALACE ON THE SEA","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1294367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wu Ke-Xi","original_name":"吳可熙","popularity":0.2428,"profile_path":"/w401WjwYr5m293vuigRv3eOqmjh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sanmei","credit_id":"594b31d29251413115007f36","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1294366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wang Shin-Hong","original_name":"Wang Shin-Hong","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":"/cTaFnMMiwlX8tJQ7qkKLGN9L6vo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"594b31e29251413111007dc1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1033620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Midi Z","original_name":"Midi Z","popularity":0.2562,"profile_path":"/fqzWs5kAjg7bn8MNbF4nvyBON7I.jpg","credit_id":"5565dd029251413543001a59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1033620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Midi Z","original_name":"Midi Z","popularity":0.2562,"profile_path":"/fqzWs5kAjg7bn8MNbF4nvyBON7I.jpg","credit_id":"594b31bd9251413155008120","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837216,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lin Sheng-Wen","original_name":"Lin Sheng-Wen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594b3610c3a368329b008c52","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1923151,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tom Fan Sheng-Siang","original_name":"Tom Fan Sheng-Siang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce758c2c3a3682a9c1df1b9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3475162","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r357gvqwKJlljx5DyN05nEjlOB8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1119}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
