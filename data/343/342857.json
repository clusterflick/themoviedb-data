The film presents a vast array of projects, concepts, and people, and it translates the diversity of permaculture into something that can be understood by an equally diverse audience. For those familiar, it will be a call to action and a glimpse into what's possible - what kind of projects and solutions are already underway. For those unfamiliar, it will be an introduction to a new way of being and a new way of relating to the Earth. For everyone, it will be a reminder that humans are capable of being planetary healing forces.","popularity":1.0516,"poster_path":"/xFUVoeOkTi0kH0Ow3QvBiQwzZKn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inhabit: A Permaculture Perspective","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2603283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Depiano","original_name":"Lisa Depiano","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e9819b2d14443001450ea01","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2603284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Eisenstein","original_name":"Charles Eisenstein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e9819e4fdf8b70013a29c2f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2603285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Falk","original_name":"Ben Falk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e9819f8fdf8b70013a29c4f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2370745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Fernandes","original_name":"Lisa Fernandes","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e9821360582240013ae4ac4","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2603288,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Costa Boutsikaris","original_name":"Costa Boutsikaris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e981a90d14443001450ea91","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2603287,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Costa Boutsikaris","original_name":"Costa Boutsikaris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e981a72fdf8b70015a2ac32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2603287,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Costa Boutsikaris","original_name":"Costa Boutsikaris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e981a7e0582240013ae4021","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105349,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aled Roberts","original_name":"Aled Roberts","popularity":0.1007,"profile_path":"/mxAafdmetI69nLPLUJ8ZOq60vLn.jpg","credit_id":"5e981ac0f6787a0019f04809","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4422154","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1nmIjIMIh5WozrBIYW4Cr1pFli0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.69,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xFUVoeOkTi0kH0Ow3QvBiQwzZKn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":690}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1672,"name":"lifestyle"},{"id":2470,"name":"education"},{"id":3721,"name":"health"},{"id":10637,"name":"food"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":196316,"name":"permaculture"},{"id":208179,"name":"environmental issue"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
