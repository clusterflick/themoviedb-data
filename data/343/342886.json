Despite the seven minutes of turbulent action, it is actually a slow film: in the war against Kreon, one of Antigone's brothers fights for the king, one against him. Both die. One of them is buried; the other is left lying on the street. Antigone goes against the king's wishes and wants to bury her brother. As a punishment Antigone is buried alive behind a wall. Her fiancé, Haimon dies, overcome with grief. Haiman's mother, Eurydike, is so upset by his death that she hangs herself. And just as the old soothsayer predicted, the king himself finds no happiness from all this death: he is killed. That makes 6 deaths, even though the war is over.","popularity":0.0807,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":104560,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hochschule für Gestaltung Ulm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antigone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4484980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heide Sparmann","original_name":"Heide Sparmann","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Antigone","credit_id":"65a71a6f4b0c630126e3094d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1269917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Roeschke","original_name":"Robert Roeschke","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kreon","credit_id":"556df98cc3a3680e9d001031","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4484982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Surja Balodis","original_name":"Surja Balodis","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Theiresias","credit_id":"65a71a795294e70130d28e29","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4484988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rainer Dietz","original_name":"Rainer Dietz","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Haimon","credit_id":"65a71b448cfcc701291682e6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1382692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ula Stöckl","original_name":"Ula Stöckl","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/7hGEundVhxXIPbGCaD3eOxuV6s2.jpg","credit_id":"556df83cc3a3680e9d001011","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1382692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ula Stöckl","original_name":"Ula Stöckl","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/7hGEundVhxXIPbGCaD3eOxuV6s2.jpg","credit_id":"65a71ad78cfcc70129168262","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1734211,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lothar Spree","original_name":"Lothar Spree","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a71a5e4b0c630126e30913","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4484985,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frieder Meyerhofer","original_name":"Frieder Meyerhofer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a71acb05b54900c5a7d3a9","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1382692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ula Stöckl","original_name":"Ula Stöckl","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/7hGEundVhxXIPbGCaD3eOxuV6s2.jpg","credit_id":"65a71ad3b6cff101202bdede","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0129755","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
