The title of the work “TK”, is an onomatopoeic description of the sound made either by stone hitting the ground or by teeth closing in bite. Departing form an eight part poem (part seven being excluded form a film itself, however its narrative significance is further explored in the exhibition surrounding the film), the artist constructs a complex polyphonic work in which poetry meets movements, sounds, silences, bodies, and ­endurability in order to project the ideas behind the work.","popularity":0.0547,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TK","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1471659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damir Ocko","original_name":"Damir Ocko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55685e54c3a3681c60002305","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
