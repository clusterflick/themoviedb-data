Their works, and that of their contemporaries, fetch tens of millions of dollars around the globe. But who were they really? Why & how exactly did they paint? What lies behind their enduring appeal?  To help answer these questions, this unique film secured unparalleled access to a major exhibition focussing on the man credited with inventing impressionism as we know it: 19th-century Parisian art collector Paul Durand-Ruel. This eagerly anticipated international exhibition is possibly the most comprehensive exploration of the Impressionists in history.","popularity":2.3781,"poster_path":"/itnKod8pTJTzu8UP3UlkHae3RA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seventh Art Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Impressionists: And the Man Who Made Them","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Exhibition on Screen: The Impressionists – and the Man Who Made Them","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"EOS: The Impressionists – and the Man Who Made Them","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lindsay","original_name":"Robert Lindsay","popularity":0.8048,"profile_path":"/7BRYggQuwUVfs3ncuVTcw7QgaDw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"562de7b19251412857009c36","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Grabsky","original_name":"Phil Grabsky","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5565c40192514135490019ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4388248","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qww0xSvm1X3gMMRkR8G4MyPoOoN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nm8TjAYXjtVEsICJmJh8xYI51Pz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7CfDRBRFS3lhzeSzCPQLYp7QJPZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4ScPSMRFVKm73eQ44IcoNTvMZ7l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/itnKod8pTJTzu8UP3UlkHae3RA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":852},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1100,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/kT0xMMen7PnmJUFe5pMo8WC2UoT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":159521,"name":"claude monet"},{"id":180578,"name":"impressionist"},{"id":231803,"name":"impressionism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"EXHIBITION ON SCREEN | The Impressionists - and the Man Who Made Them | Trailer","key":"RpObeUsbHKE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2015-04-24T11:53:11.000Z","id":"6193229c01757f008a7c3601"}]}}}
