Now they're all staying off the grid, hiding out in an abandoned building to stay away from anyone who may report them and return them to one of the camps. Luke, the group's leader, has decided to go back to the camp with Desi and Olive to break out Kenna, the only girl who stayed behind. They've been longer than they should have been, though, and Carla and the others are getting nervous. Luke and the others meet some new friends in the woods while Carla and the others need to decide between staying to wait for the others to return and risk exposure, or to save themselves and leave the others behind. This is the sequel to \"One Shot,\" inspired by Alexandra Bracken's \"The Darkest Minds.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1RIcCcOIfVWUnhXkqIuUyGpP7kM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":267436,"logo_path":null,"name":"JayPay Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Left Behind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5270275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gem Marc Collins","original_name":"Gem Marc Collins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Luke","credit_id":"686d7964d489a9c32a540667","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3038894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne-Lise von Wismar","original_name":"Anne-Lise von Wismar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Kenna","credit_id":"686d79762e4f1002429a4961","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2443554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aria Brooks","original_name":"Aria Brooks","popularity":0.147,"profile_path":"/6mQ0J7DuBuqqBoX8xW6OzS76DZr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jewel","credit_id":"686d7983bb64f77f45703461","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3141775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kinsey Kunkel","original_name":"Kinsey Kunkel","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":"/sAEpvszAJxuIIoTlJvPEWgWdnzX.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Desi","credit_id":"686d799d14a3ea9170a96026","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3849520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ava Grace Roberts","original_name":"Ava Grace Roberts","popularity":0.0752,"profile_path":"/jTjxArbMvOXua9155Zx6YcGoMbF.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Olive","credit_id":"686d79adc55cd072b9104016","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2802055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Walterhouse","original_name":"David Walterhouse","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/crElJsSPYGKYCCyOMiw4QGirqpa.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"William","credit_id":"686d79bf47d59a896aa96149","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5552338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dillon Church","original_name":"Dillon Church","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"686d79d95a3c40c6005407d2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5552345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Douglas","original_name":"Taylor Douglas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Charity","credit_id":"686d79eaa38e6c90e9ed641c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5552401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe E.
