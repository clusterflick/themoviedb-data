These qualities took her to the four corners of the world, where she photographed the major conflicts of her time. She was the first woman to be awarded the prestigious Robert Capa Gold Medal for her reportage in Lebanon in 1976, and was also one of the first photographers to cover the Vietnam War, when she was just twenty years old. Directed by American photographer Jacques Menasche, this film looks back at her reporting at the heart of this conflict that shook the world, which she lived through from 1966 to the end of 1968. As more than 400 of her photographs are shown, we hear the letters that the photographer sent to her parents, interspersed with the accounts of those who were close to her at the time.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/kY79ZosGtGc86hf3y1A89qVeBFV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The greatest female photographer of the Vietnam War.","title":"Cathy at War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5552228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Leroy","original_name":"Catherine Leroy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"686d61435a3c40c600540726","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5552232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Douglas Duncan","original_name":"David Douglas Duncan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"686d61a3501988a24c104495","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5552233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Horst Faas","original_name":"Horst Faas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"686d61b2056ab290b3e7ffae","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5552234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don McCullin","original_name":"Don McCullin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"686d61be3773a7fdb951e905","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5552236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Page","original_name":"Tim Page","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"686d61d197e7a847f2ed6271","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5552240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Simonpietri","original_name":"Christopher Simonpietri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"686d61da48e76658149a4a2f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5552230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Menasche","original_name":"Jacques Menasche","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686d6188f2cd5874466e8a03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33456997","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1112,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uZ6QI0fH4x8fVV93DY4NbzhBQNJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1977}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1094,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kY79ZosGtGc86hf3y1A89qVeBFV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":730}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
