Hartmut Geerken, director of the Goethe-Institut in Kabul, is on a mission. “We cannot change society, but we can change the landscape,” he says—literally. A trickster, a Don Quixote, Geerken approaches cultural work with playful defiance, forging deep mutual respect with a land foreign to most Europeans. The film follows him pushing a grand piano on a handcart for an impromptu concert with Afghan and German musicians, visiting a village artist, and meeting a famed tabla player—illiterate, yet musically eloquent beyond words. What begins as a whimsical journey becomes a poignant love letter to a country on the brink of irrevocable change—lighthearted, yet laced with melancholy.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wenn Goethe das gewusst hätte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2961901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hartmut Geerken","original_name":"Hartmut Geerken","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"686d3e9a9b2ba2c5c19a4732","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2961901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hartmut Geerken","original_name":"Hartmut Geerken","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686d3ea72766d73ce6703393","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6428,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arpad Bondy","original_name":"Arpad Bondy","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686d3ebcaf6b528508ed5fef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
