For her performative, cinematic piece she brings together the poetic and scientific to create a sensory experience that investigates the philosophical concept of Deep Time and events on a geological scale. This story of survival through time, unfolds with the choreography of artificial lights and sounds. Škarnulytė’s work evokes time travel and can be understood as a form of archeology of the future. Here, she investigates the unknown, including pre- and post-human evolution and adaptation, the current intersecting structures of power and the devastating effects of climate change.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":195270,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mirror Matter Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Absolute Dating","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2133827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emilija Škarnulytė","original_name":"Emilija Škarnulytė","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/nYulQSMUXlEJkRU67S977xneN74.jpg","credit_id":"686e87492766d73ce6703a30","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2739355,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jokūbas Čižikas","original_name":"Jokūbas Čižikas","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686e877e5cfab44819ed66c6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
