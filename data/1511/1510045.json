This was supposed to be one out of an eight part series of TV specials that featured prominent artists. Most of these specials never came to fruition. The ballet told the story of Noah and the Flood with symbolic references to other biblical narratives. The choreography was directed by George Balanchine and the ballet was performed by the New York City Ballet. An addition to the performance the TV special also included an overview of Stravinsky’s career and an exposition of the biblical context. The performance was aired on CBS in 1962 with Breck shampoo as the sponsor.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ikLn4u9pFxu1m7jjXL67T3Xn2gU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noah and the Flood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Harvey","original_name":"Laurence Harvey","popularity":0.7212,"profile_path":"/l9iSQUawIByUjpLg5SI03oOpd64.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"686c33702fd1232682703155","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques d'Amboise","original_name":"Jacques d'Amboise","popularity":0.1231,"profile_path":"/sjgeqYKWLkYY2fGYzxhQrY500BV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"686c33b4e43369073151e366","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsa Lanchester","original_name":"Elsa Lanchester","popularity":0.7739,"profile_path":"/jek9jcqODZGWnmcMm7ynkSaLSWb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Noah's Wife","credit_id":"686c33fb940547aa229a4355","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Cabot","original_name":"Sebastian Cabot","popularity":1.2861,"profile_path":"/uAgoTmwvabGX00LnYyDfyL7TPUP.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Noah","credit_id":"686c3416a46a022c97a95ccc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5550473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jillana","original_name":"Jillana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"686c3461913b1e9b1351e176","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5550475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Tripp","original_name":"Paul Tripp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"686c34aadc61d3bf965401a7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1227286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Villella","original_name":"Edward Villella","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"686c34bfa1aab494bc702fcf","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974330,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Igor Stravinsky","original_name":"Игорь Стравинский","popularity":0.1714,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686c32e1998a7677b06e8654","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248654,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"George Balanchine","original_name":"George Balanchine","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686c331de097f755b8103ce7","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1914156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Craft","original_name":"Robert Craft","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686c34f21d0ef79eab7031d9","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177682,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rouben Ter-Arutunian","original_name":"Rouben Ter-Arutunian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686c35155a3c40c600540193","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1238017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirk Browning","original_name":"Kirk Browning","popularity":0.4457,"profile_path":"/sqqMIpAeowuV9dFVYHmgeocOGMr.jpg","credit_id":"686c353d89dc8fa30e51e3a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.655,"height":775,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ikLn4u9pFxu1m7jjXL67T3Xn2gU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":508}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1962-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
