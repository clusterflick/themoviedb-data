The film is a work formed of animated sequences and drone footage from Achiampongâ€™s personal archives, featuring an original score.  Created as a meditation on a period of separation between the artist and his children, observing his familial narrative within the pandemic and the trauma of forced isolation during unprecedented times. Speaking directly to his children, Reliquary 2 is an archive of contemplative prose and a historical record documenting this surreal and challenging period.  Reliquary 2 is a continuation of the Relic Traveller series. Mixing visual poetry with generational healing, the series explores past, present, and future, through narratives of Pan Africanism and African diasporic identity in relation to colonialism, postcolonialism and the heightened nationalism of recent times.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cc8nh4DivFS6VW8m0BiEwajL1ia.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reliquary 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1826254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Achiampong","original_name":"Larry Achiampong","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686d2b75c8ec1745a3ceecd8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1826254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Achiampong","original_name":"Larry Achiampong","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686d2ba4172af16ba29a48af","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nephertiti Oboshie Schandorf","original_name":"Nephertiti Oboshie Schandorf","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686d2bb2adbf23ebc9a962b8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1826254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Achiampong","original_name":"Larry Achiampong","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686d2bc589dc8fa30e51e73d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":791,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/shX4miIS3QNpHPThbL3ADBymqgy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1406}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1141,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cc8nh4DivFS6VW8m0BiEwajL1ia.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":761}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
