The film portrays a man deeply devoted to the causes of the poor, the marginalised, and the forgotten: from his early years in Argentina to his role as a spiritual leader on the global stage.  Blending archival footage, personal testimonies, and a thoughtful, ethical perspective, the documentary offers an intimate and timely portrait of one of the most influential figures of our time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/knPHg37tsRDw7iX7t3EBsWC8Ko6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":228561,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amargo y Retruco Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"A shepherd of the people, a voice for the voiceless — the inspiring  journey of Pope Francis.","title":"Pray for me: Pope Francis' story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Pray for me: Pope Francis' story","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Pregate per me: la storia di Papa Francesco","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1523704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pope Francis","original_name":"Pope Francis","popularity":0.3958,"profile_path":"/taIcvWkt6D0nWOdHIJeRnjLc7In.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"686ce557bba85b5ba454043e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4704272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Facundo Bartucci","original_name":"Facundo Bartucci","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/eLqS36eA2OneWGUFLkmRuewdPM1.jpg","credit_id":"686ce58c8775b486e5e7fdc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4704272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Facundo Bartucci","original_name":"Facundo Bartucci","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/eLqS36eA2OneWGUFLkmRuewdPM1.jpg","credit_id":"686ce59b7aab150fb97033f4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4704241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Facundo Mugica","original_name":"Facundo Mugica","popularity":0.1324,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686ce5bbadbf23ebc9a9614b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2098942,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Miguel de Zuviría","original_name":"Miguel de Zuviría","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686ce5dd47d59a896aa95e7b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5551334,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Federico Etman","original_name":"Federico Etman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686ce6042150c1dcde6e88bd","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149796,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lucas Larriera","original_name":"Lucas Larriera","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/rDCTnQ9WJo1MyXFCPSkCkQhwiIE.jpg","credit_id":"686ce617f6ff1a25916e8715","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5551335,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matías Fontenla","original_name":"Matías Fontenla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686ce62e2e31769cfe51e337","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1053480,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Neal Weisman","original_name":"Neal Weisman","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686ce64b6ddea7161651e3bb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4704272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Facundo Bartucci","original_name":"Facundo Bartucci","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/eLqS36eA2OneWGUFLkmRuewdPM1.jpg","credit_id":"686ce68269fa3110009a4660","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/knPHg37tsRDw7iX7t3EBsWC8Ko6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1944}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":717,"name":"pope"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":10596,"name":"argentina"},{"id":277087,"name":"francis"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
