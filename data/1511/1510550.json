With the decline of walking, are we at risk of losing our humanity? Made To Walk explores this question through intimate encounters with a gallery of extra/ordinary individuals — walkers and scientists — who reclaim or redefine walking as a way to reconnect with themselves. In a world that is increasingly sedentary, virtual, and fragmented, they each, in their own way, resist gravity, imbalance, the loss of identity, direction, or the experience of grief, by responding to the vital and inevitable call to stand and move on two feet.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Made To Walk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2555857,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vali Fugulin","original_name":"Vali Fugulin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686d5e6a1b9a8ab1e8a95fec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2555857,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vali Fugulin","original_name":"Vali Fugulin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686d5e77787b8e0829ed61c1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1215970,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ziad Touma","original_name":"Ziad Touma","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"686d5e85d150c3cc65a9630d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
