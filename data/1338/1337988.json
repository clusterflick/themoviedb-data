The process of restoration leads to a subtle reflection on landscape architecture and the role of Man in Nature. Guided by the drawings of the Swiss architect Georges Descombes and his Superposition group, the film meanders between seasons and stages of construction, with a soft interior music that reveals the global challenges of this small piece of territory. A large story for a tiny river.","popularity":0.0533,"poster_path":"/oJI6zDg0cVkBBqrryTD8OdjIZX2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Draw me a river","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2117161,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Favre","original_name":"Michel Favre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c8a2e535f89cb980ea99f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6166180","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oJI6zDg0cVkBBqrryTD8OdjIZX2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Cinéma bio (Carouge, Switzerland)","release_date":"2017-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Vimeo","release_date":"2017-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
