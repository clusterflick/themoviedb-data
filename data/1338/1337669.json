The Cock Squad, led by neophyte Trevor, is determined to destroy Misery the Referee’s house of red and yellow cards. Echoing the dramaturgy of the game, WINNER dissects socially constructed power hierarchies, crowd psychology, and the constant pressure to perform. Through dance, the film restates and radically transforms football’s most impassioned moments: elation and triumph, brutality and ferocity, suffering and defeat.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winner","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3081933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianna Simnett","original_name":"Marianna Simnett","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c7c45c9a61583f951d277f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
