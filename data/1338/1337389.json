They wander through the streets of Calais, waiting for the right truck to come, abandoned to the harshness of the weather, deprived of everything, harassed by the police. The lack of comment and interviews conveys a particular echo to each image, each face, each gesture, all expressing the suffering, the exhaustion, the fear, but also the joy of living, the vitality, the sense of humour and the hopes of these young men abandoned by the world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Comment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1748184,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathalie Loubeyre","original_name":"Nathalie Loubeyre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c7272c5a453e1ea0d83a9e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3177531,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joël Labat","original_name":"Joël Labat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c7273af9e5711dd9f29ad0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5591272","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival (Cinéma du Réel, Beaubourg)","release_date":"2009-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
