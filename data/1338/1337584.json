For 80 years, he has fought steadfastly to provide his community with what they urgently need: jobs. As a leader of the Aboriginal Blackman United (ABU)—whose slogan is “If we don’t work, don’t nobody work”—Richards has been behind decades of protests at discriminatory worksites around Bayview Hunters Point. His commitment has led to important legislative victories that created mandatory local hire requirements, that have led to job opportunities that either previously didn’t exist or had been withheld from the community. For his 80th birthday, we’ve gathered his friends, fellow community leaders, and San Francisco officials to reflect on his legacy and lasting influence on workforce development in the city.","popularity":0.1844,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":230181,"logo_path":"/9bjMEufvWqfNp1ZpO9c9Vc9sdxf.png","name":"Citizen Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"James Richards, 80 Years in Hunters Point","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Epps","original_name":"Kevin Epps","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c77b3b7409106764874afd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":387,"name":"california"},{"id":213971,"name":"activism"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
