The fate of her sister, Anastasia - also a poet - is lesser known, despite the fact that she, too, had a life as interesting and nearly as tragic. This video-portrait of Anastasia Tsvetaeva, shot when she was over 90, is a fascinating glimpse into the life of a woman who saw history unfolding. Despite her advanced years, she maintains a bright wit, a charm, and a joie de vivre, evident as she recounts her memories.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/mJp6UDmj0teRBexZiqE5VO5daB8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1989-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am 90, My Steps Are Light","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Mne devyanosto let, yeshche legka pokhodka...","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Мне 90 лет, еще легка походка...","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Mne 90 let, yeshche legka pokhodka...","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1073552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Goldovskaya","original_name":"Marina Goldovskaya","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/xCQuw54l9JsCpx5AjXNGPqGi8bZ.jpg","credit_id":"66c6eb1fc0a9a7f4aeeab610","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1073552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marina Goldovskaya","original_name":"Marina Goldovskaya","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/xCQuw54l9JsCpx5AjXNGPqGi8bZ.jpg","credit_id":"66c6eb28b7518b8cf1918a90","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3986518,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tatyana Aleksandrova","original_name":"Tatyana Aleksandrova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c6eb82e0583d13e751b58f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0244540","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3tspFwqJ3wgo3sxgb9p37uZy1gN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mJp6UDmj0teRBexZiqE5VO5daB8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
