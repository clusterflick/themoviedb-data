Unrecognized in their time, they are now being considered amongst the most important artists of the 20th century. Utilizing a wholly original approach to filmmaking where nonfiction and fiction are interconnected through collaborative film works made with the next generation of Latinx artists, \"Without Permission\" reimagines what is possible today in cinema and art while celebrating an iconoclastic group that was far ahead of its time.","popularity":0.2435,"poster_path":"/suX1zqRn7FFlCtLz78JnF9g1Its.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124434,"logo_path":"/hOMuvcviKn3bViqnYCmQQrlCjxx.png","name":"North of Now","origin_country":"US"},{"id":103832,"logo_path":"/AhbCrTCxKtl2706mPPLHRdQ1yQ6.png","name":"La Corriente del Golfo","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ASCO: Without Permission","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3036576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Gamboa Jr.","original_name":"Harry Gamboa Jr.","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66c79f3e141928f892c3b802","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3482631,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Gronk","original_name":"Gronk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66c79f484d149db396d1a20b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3977970,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Willie Herron","original_name":"Willie Herron","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66c79f51383fe82c59ea7d4b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2743335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patssi Valdez","original_name":"Patssi Valdez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66c79f566480acefe3eabc6b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321103,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Travis Gutiérrez Senger","original_name":"Travis Gutiérrez Senger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c79f66b0244f5302874bef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diego Luna","original_name":"Diego Luna","popularity":3.8106,"profile_path":"/ppMi7UJPmOdAZ8XerakDpikar0g.jpg","credit_id":"66c79f827409106764874bf3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gael García Bernal","original_name":"Gael García Bernal","popularity":4.416,"profile_path":"/7mq3EQN1oJfYNXkv9xKXKu6Ccw5.jpg","credit_id":"66c79f7985df8746dfea7d75","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18263546","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/suX1zqRn7FFlCtLz78JnF9g1Its.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1944}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
