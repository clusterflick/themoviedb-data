MacDonald first encountered the Seven Sisters mountains in the 1980s when he was invited to northern British Columbia for the Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en land claim case, in which the Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en First Nations took the government to court in an effort to regain jurisdiction of their territory that was being destroyed by clear-cut logging.  Created in 1989 using aerial footage taken from several vantage points, Seven Sisters showcases the grandness of the landscape with lively mountain goats and beautiful flowers and plants. However, itâ€™s also a document of the devastation that clear-cut logging had on the area, indicating that if action is not taken soon to protect this unique environment, perhaps this will be the only way to see it.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/w2ojuttnigvGMVxRlslbIZfJcug.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seven Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4900013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike MacDonald","original_name":"Mike MacDonald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c7ee5fc0a9a7f4aeeacdb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w2ojuttnigvGMVxRlslbIZfJcug.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
