A review of former President Jacob Zuma’s scandal-ridden ascent, reign, and ultimate ousting, via his cartoons which capture issues in the post-Mandela period – corruption, subversion of the Constitution and the rule of law, and threats to freedom of expression. The film considers freedom of expression in contemporary South Africa with reference to the boundaries tested in Zapiro’s cartoons and his resolute defiance of attempts to stifle his work and affirms his continuing relevance.","popularity":0.0714,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Showerhead","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1436309,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Craig Tanner","original_name":"Craig Tanner","popularity":0.0473,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c804ebf2bfd8e9268f0d79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"South African Film Festival","release_date":"2025-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"South African Film Festival","release_date":"2025-05-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
