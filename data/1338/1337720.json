Drift is comprised of hundreds of press and amateur images of the sea found on the internet. In this multi-channel video, Blain has filled each screen with careful layers of these images, which lift like sails in the breeze to reveal scenes of fragile, makeshift boats floating on perilous vast waters. Drift alludes to the countless migrants who flee situation of war, poverty and violence, but become lost in the open sea as they drift away from their native country in search of freedom. As a moving collage, the video commemorates these anonymous people, hundred of whom are currently in danger and astray on the immense sea. Drift stands in resistance against the desensitizing effect of overwhelming amounts of media imagery, and refuses to allow the unknown fate of these unprotected women, men and children to fall into oblivion.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/pZcsWNwQ8yHJ26eohaH5WwHLfpl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drift","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pZcsWNwQ8yHJ26eohaH5WwHLfpl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2019-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
