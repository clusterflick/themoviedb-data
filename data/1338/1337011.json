The documentary features testimonies from members of the former Corinthians player's family, including his brothers, among them the former player Raí, his mother, and his son Gustavo. Journalists Juca Kfouri, José Trajano, and Xico Sá are also interviewed, as well as musician Toquinho and former Corinthians and Brazilian national team teammates such as Zico and Wladimir.  The production showcases Sócrates' time studying medicine in Ribeirão, his journey through the teams Botafogo de Ribeirão Preto, Corinthians, Fiorentina, Flamengo, and, of course, the national team.
