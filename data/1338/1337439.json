They played gigs at local clubs and toured school auditoriums all over their adopted countries, while finding partners and having children at the same time.  This did happen, just in a previous era. From the late 1950s up to the 1970s, some of the greatest African-American jazz musicians moved to Sweden/Scandinavia, making new families and a lasting musical impression on the country.  LEGACY is an account of their lives, their music and their families and their legacies. We follow their children, now grown, who share their stories for the first time: about growing up with a world-famous father, yet getting teased at school about their dark skin.  This film is as much a documentary about music as it is a portrait of how individual experiences of race, visions of society and artistic dreams intersect, giving rise to an entirely new musical experience.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/q3dkuJhIXeExdWkytIgHkhPjFTg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Legacy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1742198,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manal Masri","original_name":"Manal Masri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c740bfe502ee7c13158afa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/q3dkuJhIXeExdWkytIgHkhPjFTg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1792}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CPH:DOX 2025","release_date":"2025-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
