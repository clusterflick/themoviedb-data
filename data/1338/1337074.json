Surrounded by mountains and rivers, the Tŝilhqot’in People have cared for this territory for millennia. With increasing external pressures from natural-resource extraction companies, the communities mobilized in the early 21st century to assert their rightful title to their lands. Following a decision by the Supreme Court of British Columbia in 2007 that only partially acknowledged their claim, the Tŝilhqot’in Nation’s plight was heard in the Supreme Court of Canada. In a historic decision in 2014, the country’s highest court ruled what the Tŝilhqot’in have long asserted: that they alone have full title to their homelands.","popularity":0.4953,"poster_path":"/5Yxm2LSCQkicbf6VM6fk2gl98BD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Spirit of the Tsilqot'in People is Hovering over the Supreme Court","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":940632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alanis Obomsawin","original_name":"Alanis Obomsawin","popularity":0.2403,"profile_path":"/hs0GVPlJD29UTyC26xllXMQQYoH.jpg","credit_id":"66c640ee841b84c1ad5cc205","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30832466","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Yxm2LSCQkicbf6VM6fk2gl98BD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1329,"name":"canada"},{"id":215162,"name":"indigenous peoples"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":269694,"name":"rights"},{"id":284631,"name":"law"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
