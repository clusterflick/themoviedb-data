Mihm's ode to \"teensploitation\" films of the 1950s and the cinematic oeuvre of the Coen Brothers, three female juvenile delinquents obtain a firearm and, just for the thrill of it, start robbing the fine folks of New Berlin. Unfortunately, their crime spree takes an unexpected turn after they mug and nearly murder the gambling-addicted pastor of the local churchâ€”who turns out to be an immortal, blood-sucking creature of the night! Hijinks ensue when the vampiric padre hires a pair of hitmen to help him retrieve his stolen cash and seek revenge against the three bad girls responsible!","popularity":0.1543,"poster_path":"/AOd9elglO4kWDYW8adsJboCJzN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174030,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saint Euphoria Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Bad Girls Who Find a Gun and Become Vampires","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4900146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Baker","original_name":"Jackie Baker","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Queenie Bee","credit_id":"66c82c0ab44e07ed641d4104","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4900147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marty Benoit","original_name":"Marty Benoit","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"The Narrator","credit_id":"66c82c5b35f89cb980ea95ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Kaiser","original_name":"Elizabeth Kaiser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Short Stack","credit_id":"66c82c735966d5395f8764a0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael G.
