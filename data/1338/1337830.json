The way for the Weinerville gang to celebrate it is by going to New York City to throw a party for all of the kids that live there. Marc, Boney, Captain Bob, Louie, Pops, and Socko get inside Marc's van for a road trip to the Big Apple. Dottie and Zip who remain in town were looking forward to some peace and quiet, until Cocktail Frank tells Dotty that the bands that were going to be there just withdrew from attending. Dotty tells Zip to stop the van from leaving so that Dotty, Cocktail Frank, and Zip can tell them what happens and have the three of them come along as the substitute band or there won't be a party. Zip was unsuccessful in stopping the van. Now Dotty and Zip must find another way to get in touch with the gang who are now separated from each other and lost in the Big Apple.","popularity":1.2388,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5371,"logo_path":"/2GFJ3jJ7dhjqcOGj41aTwd3OhQT.png","name":"Nickelodeon Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Weinerville New Year's Special: Lost in the Big Apple","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1212777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Weiner","original_name":"Marc Weiner","popularity":0.2052,"profile_path":"/oXIhA02oKzS9b0oXmE1g3tUoSYI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66c86e2a613112fd5bb3007e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Joan Hart","original_name":"Melissa Joan Hart","popularity":1.166,"profile_path":"/7ohLAH6mZ5fDwFMWJpZcwL6lQM6.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66c873052da6330b93e4d096","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael C.
