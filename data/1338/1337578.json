A barbershop is a place where people want change. A place to find a new self. The barber finds a different self on the other side of the mirror, and between drowsiness and thoughts, he is lost between dreams and reality, pondering in a different space. The barber travels with various customers to a mysterious space. Invisible images are projected into each mind along with the recitation of poems.","popularity":0.4074,"poster_path":"/nBtuh6Solf4fciUNu4MsycZY18a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1996-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"生まれ変わるとしたら","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morio Agata","original_name":"あがた森魚","popularity":0.2128,"profile_path":"/jsYyl1gLXADcmaU3iPWrbxHFXpV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66c9ecbfb7e2cb383ed82c7b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taro Yamamoto","original_name":"山本太郎","popularity":0.4434,"profile_path":"/1cxXOgY8Z12La1jf0b9BVKgMCjM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66c9ecda8dcaad872294acc7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":551764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kōen Okumura","original_name":"奥村公延","popularity":0.2659,"profile_path":"/6N14DC4OgLbg20DCSU86h9IEzXO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66c9ecf7a3a42ce3611d5f73","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":66153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naomi Nishida","original_name":"西田尚美","popularity":0.7933,"profile_path":"/kXRGUSybmoyiQ5iqNtGq5aBGei4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66c9ed1e3063cc85350d2acb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hajime Yamazaki","original_name":"山崎一","popularity":0.282,"profile_path":"/fWYQsEFheZRT0C3tTUcM6x8Axt0.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66c9ed30b867a0aeddfb9e93","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takahisa Zeze","original_name":"瀬々敬久","popularity":0.3906,"profile_path":"/mhUKffbVUEh706d3rkY4OnMnoxh.jpg","credit_id":"66c776ab53e25821f0f29d95","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takahisa Zeze","original_name":"瀬々敬久","popularity":0.3906,"profile_path":"/mhUKffbVUEh706d3rkY4OnMnoxh.jpg","credit_id":"66c7769cb09fdc93e746591d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1121,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/nBtuh6Solf4fciUNu4MsycZY18a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":747}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"VHS","release_date":"1996-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
