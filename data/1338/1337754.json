This video cassette was made at the recording of the album Heathen Earth, between 8.10 and 9.00 pm on Saturday 16 February 1980 in front of an invited audience at the studios of Industrial Records Ltd. In addition to the single camera recording of the performance, certain visual information from our files has been included. The soundtrack of the tape was taken independent of the 8-track audio master recording and it remains \"live\" and unremixed - it consequently differs from the album in some places. Like the TG sound itself, the quality and content of this recording cannot and should not be compared with conventional commercial recordings.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9HjBLXVnFrE1quBklULAg5EASrc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Throbbing Gristle - Recording Heathen Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Throbbing Gristle - The Recording of the Heathen Earth Album","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monte Cazazza","original_name":"Monte Cazazza","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d1648064443984b11dfd8e","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monte Cazazza","original_name":"Monte Cazazza","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d1648a6ecec5f39a815d10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9HjBLXVnFrE1quBklULAg5EASrc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1980-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
