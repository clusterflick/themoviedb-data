Becoming very much excited in his embarrassment, he begins turning his pockets inside out and getting redder and looking more awkward every minute, until Sue, becoming disenchanted with her foolish looking lover, hastens to greet Arthur, whom she sees approaching. It is plain that the latter is gaining ground with Miss Sue, when all at once he begins to sneeze and is unable also to locate his handkerchief. He forgets that on entering he had laid it with his hat on the table, where Gus was fortunate to find it and owing to which good fortune the latter is able to regain the side of his fiancée, who is now alone, as Arthur, feeling that awful tickling sensation in his nose, had to flee.","popularity":0.0416,"poster_path":"/wM1uxxwpXer1sFkW8VMUtmmDB8t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27680,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société cinématographique des auteurs et gens de lettres (SCAGL)","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7981,"logo_path":"/6Yv1gIAuGkHS5Vis4UjnqHhCPWV.png","name":"Pathé","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":218622,"logo_path":null,"name":"S.C.A.G.L.
