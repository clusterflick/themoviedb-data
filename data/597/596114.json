Marcos and Lourdes, one of the couples, need to save the money, which will be divided among the four of them the next day. To do this, they decide to spend their time in a cheap hotel, where Lourdes is the victim of an overdose and is on the verge of death. When Marcos leaves to seek help, the girl dies and is found by the hotel manager, who despairs, thinking that Marcos ran away after murdering her. Due to his financial problems and terrified of the situation, the manager decides to bury the girl with his own hands and ends up, unknowingly, also burying the suitcase with the stolen money.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/co8XezOMLvTbK6jGiJwdl28ewnp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1986-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Good Smoker Hillbilly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Os Seqüestradores","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1167110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Cavalcanti","original_name":"Francisco Cavalcanti","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":"/5NXZUfdLdw7KRKUlFypkM2YKr5U.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5cb9854fc3a3683abf84ce49","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1135762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oswaldo Cirillo","original_name":"Oswaldo Cirillo","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/tJTJF6Ev0eqQK8a4MRoqhzQSKNn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5cb9855fc3a368694c8146f4","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1637596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Solange Dumont","original_name":"Solange Dumont","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/d7QR6k5VOhebtKoc7ZH2e9KxRyl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5cb985690e0a267e34ec3d96","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1284112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marthus Mathias","original_name":"Marthus Mathias","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/l22BYhp254uXPuAfMnDB88g8bBq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"611f744c387651002e78b352","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1754261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karina Miranda","original_name":"Karina Miranda","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/pj5R0sI344jA7OpTJPr52SvP6Q5.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"631f62c00d2f53007f5db309","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1167110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Cavalcanti","original_name":"Francisco Cavalcanti","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":"/5NXZUfdLdw7KRKUlFypkM2YKr5U.jpg","credit_id":"5cb98534c3a3680cad813c19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0442471","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/co8XezOMLvTbK6jGiJwdl28ewnp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":503}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
