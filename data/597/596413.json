These images are processed and vectorized frame to frame. It focuses on the textures that emerge by shaping terrain, shapes and forms, proposing a permanent play between the formal limits among abstraction and figuration. It seeks to put in tension the referent of the film; what it has been (characters in a space-time recorded with a camera ) along with what it is (figures dissolved in surfaces and reliefs of a visual and sonorous matter in constant mutation and alteration).","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4qKS2uqC1OSs8ySJbKzuS4driJJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Topographies of a distant noise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2292730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agustín Telo","original_name":"Agustín Telo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbb24250e0a2641edef2eea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1706,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4qKS2uqC1OSs8ySJbKzuS4driJJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
