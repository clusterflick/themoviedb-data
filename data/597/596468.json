Deeply offended by this lack of recognition of her more than forty-year relationship with the love of her life, Edie decided to sue the United States government – and won. Windsor and Kaplan’s legal and personal journeys are told in their own words, and through interviews with others of the legal team, movement activists, legal analysts, well-known supporters and opponents. Beyond the story of this pivotal case in the marriage equality movement and the stories behind it, the film also tells the story of our journey as a people, as a culture, and as citizens with equal rights.","popularity":0.055,"poster_path":"/6TEV3jf3hd6oeM4Yr81mLkc6pTe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113790,"logo_path":"/g7FpsadP1UG9MotNi54RvE5hiGY.png","name":"JustFilms / Ford Foundation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To a More Perfect Union: U.S. v Windsor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1655339,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Donna Zaccaro","original_name":"Donna Zaccaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbb6dfc9251412577f4fd37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7355960","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5nR2JWBKMwkkWidFhNmLmj0SZGV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fHDNbHO2OkpXtfMyIDLsuFGZh9M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":679},{"aspect_ratio":0.641,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6TEV3jf3hd6oeM4Yr81mLkc6pTe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":961}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
