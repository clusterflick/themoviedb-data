Hudson Music was there to capture this historic event as the worldâ€™s premier drum festival returned to the venue where it all began.  The lineup for the 2010 Festival featured world-class drumming artists of all styles: the aggressively complex attack of progressive star Chris Pennie (Coheed & Cambria, Dillinger Escape Plan), a stylistically diverse set from Nashville session master Shannon Forrest, the unstoppable groove of Shawn Pelton and his band House of Diablo, the cutting-edge stylings of breakbeat/jam-band/jazz master Adam Deitch, the amazing creativity of international drum star Benny Greb, and the classic funk of New Orleans master Stanton Moore and his trio.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/m3yELO5E8G8sePO0G8fFsWmwHV1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Modern Drummer Festival 2010","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m3yELO5E8G8sePO0G8fFsWmwHV1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
