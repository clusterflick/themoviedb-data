Near the Sevillian town of El Palmar de Troya, in 1968, people begin to say that the Virgin appears and the two friends take advantage of the situation. Soon a network of economic interests and credulity is created that makes it easier for Manuel and Clemente to achieve their goal: a monumental basilica, a religious order of nuns, priests and bishops of their own, and even a pope, Gregory XVII. Satire on the curious origin of the Palmarian Catholic Church and its unique founders.","popularity":0.6436,"poster_path":"/jia5X2eiJ3DbHyCaheontpAvC7q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117294,"logo_path":null,"name":"Javier Palmero
