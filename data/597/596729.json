Both films feature archival documentary material, including footage of the streets of Havana and black and white photographs of artists and intellectuals in Cuba, combined with scenes filmed by Canadian artist Stan Douglas on a set in Vancouver. One of the films consists of five sequential parts, while the other has only three parts. The five-part film is almost twice as long as the three-part film, so that although both loops start playing together, they quickly go out of sync with one other.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inconsolable Memories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1612076,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Douglas","original_name":"Stan Douglas","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":"/x0CLTWAYaVAiJWGZCa7z4lI8UWq.jpg","credit_id":"5d15531218b751002d5c2ed1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
