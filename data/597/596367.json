They can adopt or have a child with the help of a single mother or lesbian couple. But just as any heterosexual family, they want to have children of their own and have a ‘real’ family. Fortunately a niece offers to be the surrogate to carry their child, but not of her own ovum. The dads to be only need an egg and a clinic to achieve the fertilization. What follows is a harrowing account of the long road between hopes and disappointments.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vnHiOfdx0SlUrbeH3W9sDVLRKCr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sperm and the 11 Eggs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2292642,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia von Graevenitz","original_name":"Julia von Graevenitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbae2f7c3a3686b0b8a0515","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7842766","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1156,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vnHiOfdx0SlUrbeH3W9sDVLRKCr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":815}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
