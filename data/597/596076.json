Nick Difino, a food performer, posed this question to himself. After being diagnosed with a Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, his disease became a challenge to find his own \"recipe for happiness\". His story - mainly narrated using his video diaries - is alternated with the voices of seven acclaimed Chefs and artists - among which Simone Salvini, Roy Paci, Diego Rossi and others - who portray Nick's struggle, since cooking for him during the treatment has got them closely involved. While preparing the meals they ponder over subjects as disease, happiness, love for life, death and - of course - the role of Food.","popularity":0.0639,"poster_path":"/veopZ31e9BTiNNYe6TRkMc60nog.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alla Salute","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Health's Kitchen: Alla Salute","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicola Difino","original_name":"Nicola Difino","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5cb95fb692514151caf365c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paola Maugeri","original_name":"Paola Maugeri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5cb95fc70e0a266b98f2aa39","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicola Difino","original_name":"Nicola Difino","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb960140e0a266b98f2aa81","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2291831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brunella Filì","original_name":"Brunella Filì","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb95f27c3a3683abf849eb7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1422513,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antonella Gaeta","original_name":"Antonella Gaeta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cb95ff50e0a26105aec8f3f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8103862","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2697,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/veopZ31e9BTiNNYe6TRkMc60nog.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1798},{"aspect_ratio":0.742,"height":2697,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/eZxKqVfeqZuEjmnv5WgDYDHCEPE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
