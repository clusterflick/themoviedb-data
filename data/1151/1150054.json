Like that, Jeles' film also depicts the audition of dance singer-candidates. Rich with a more direct social background (which is also his stated goal), Jeles prefers to focus more 'narrowly' on one of the candidates. Rich watched the KISZ jury, Jeles has no jury. At Jeles, the character(s) somehow took me into a house of mourning, into reality, where it doesn't matter who the jury and the authorities are, and there is no outside world, there is only her, the unfortunate girl, with her silent, thin voice and Helena (herself) living in the age of chivalry.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A meghallgatás","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
