Animation by Eric Leiser. Composed by Pauline Kim Harris and Spencer Topel  Deo is an acoustic-electronic transcription of Johannes Ockeghem’s stunning Deo Gratias devised as a complement to Ambient Chaconne. Notable as a 36-part canon, Ockeghem evokes singing of angels in heaven via an innovation on a traditional canon, using this ancient musical device as a kind of acoustic feedback delay. In essence, our Deo expands this idea of delays to a canon of thousands, in an ever expanding and infinite soundscape, where the melodies eventually dissolve into resonance.","popularity":0.2693,"poster_path":"/cj6NJr3QiIvC3hJVFfLb5GuT0x2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176317,"logo_path":null,"name":"Albino Fawn Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In reimagining the Bach Chaconne and Ockeghem’s Deo Gratias, I searched for meaning and connection to the greater, mysterious universe.","title":"Herione: Deo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":440020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Leiser","original_name":"Eric Leiser","popularity":0.2009,"profile_path":"/TOM8AIiQcl8c5uQs1R3e5QkIyT.jpg","credit_id":"64ae071c8a0e9b00e37590e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":440020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Leiser","original_name":"Eric Leiser","popularity":0.2009,"profile_path":"/TOM8AIiQcl8c5uQs1R3e5QkIyT.jpg","credit_id":"64ae07271cfe3a013b338192","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":440020,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Leiser","original_name":"Eric Leiser","popularity":0.2009,"profile_path":"/TOM8AIiQcl8c5uQs1R3e5QkIyT.jpg","credit_id":"64ae0735e24b930100c8299b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4158181,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pauline Kim Harris","original_name":"Pauline Kim Harris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ae074c1cfe3a013b3381bc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ayzAtiWA67NJ10APtbE1Z0xMvqt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.743,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cj6NJr3QiIvC3hJVFfLb5GuT0x2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1115}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":201055,"name":"johann sebastian bach"},{"id":212727,"name":"timelapse"},{"id":312181,"name":"eric leiser"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
