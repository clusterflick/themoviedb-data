Jahan is a taxidermist. He tries to freeze the flight of birds, reflecting his view of life affecting relationships. His world is like a box of eerie memories frozen in taxi -dermal mounts, glass jars and bead eyes. Indulekha, who had an emotional paralytic stroke, is bedridden. Life goes on disconnected in the huge ancestral house of dark shades. Fighting the forced solitude, the teenager created a magical world of happiness around her. On a fateful day, confused and drunk, Jahan during his usual charade of expressing his unrequited love towards Indulekha mistakenly advances towards Meenakshi. That dark act throws the splintered lives into a moral vortex. It takes her to an abysmal plunge to loss of her pictorial passion of life.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2020-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pakshikalkk Parayanullath","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4155380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nilanjana Sha Sudha","original_name":"Nilanjana Sha Sudha","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Meenakshy","credit_id":"64ac0a2b8a0e9b00e3748562","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1847183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amar Ramachandran","original_name":"Amar Ramachandran","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/6fagi8DEGXmQFECMdG5UVfV5Zx0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Muhammad Jahan","credit_id":"64ac1889b686b900af9ef777","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4155470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Namita Nambiar","original_name":"Namita Nambiar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Laila","credit_id":"64ac18a56a344800ea8d7429","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3302727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meenakshi Dinesh","original_name":"Meenakshi Dinesh","popularity":0.9522,"profile_path":"/o0YtfGpdX0wozp2ASeW4pmveEuO.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Suchitra","credit_id":"64ac18c08a0e9b00e3748d7b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4155475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sudha Radhika","original_name":"Sudha Radhika","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/b2c3tcpmjPo2RlIdbjylP3trO0h.jpg","credit_id":"64ac1914e24b93013aba469b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3773625,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mohamed.
