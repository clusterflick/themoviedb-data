Its editor is the newspaper personified. He is much like a civil servant, working for the people of the community. His editorial is the most personal yet widespread contact he has with the community. The letters to the editor are democracy in action. News from the other side of the globe, which could affect townsfolk, makes it way to them through the newspaper. These world stories are equally as important as the news from around the corner, which again is a reflection of the town. The newspaper's main revenue source is through advertising, which in a way is its own form of news.","popularity":0.0718,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1948-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Home Town Paper","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1236153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Drainie","original_name":"John Drainie","popularity":0.1109,"profile_path":"/oHTlp7J0I7uQzGq5AJWwePXgBsM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"64ad7a2766a0d30100db158e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1314640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morten Parker","original_name":"Morten Parker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad79e93e2ec8012ee55485","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1314640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morten Parker","original_name":"Morten Parker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad9ba8b686b9015011b570","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1618224,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Robert Humble","original_name":"Robert Humble","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad9b9066a0d300ade9e817","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1352220,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gudrun Parker","original_name":"Gudrun Parker","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad9bd466a0d300c670519f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2557295,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Don Wellington","original_name":"Don Wellington","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad9bcb6a344800ad779845","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1314640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Morten Parker","original_name":"Morten Parker","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad9bb0e24b9300c6b0bce9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1764659","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1948-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
