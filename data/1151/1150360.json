Set in a typical, close-knit neighbourhood, Peter Pisa, the fish store owner, is having a torrid affair with Rita Decroot, a bank teller with big dreams. She is also the girlfriend of reigning local gangster, Toto. Clive Boomer is a budding stand-up comedian and bank teller who owes a small fortune to Toto. Clive turns to Peter for assistance, and Peter agrees to take over the debt. In a cruel twist of fate, Toto seeks repayment by assigning Peter the task of killing Rita for her illicit liaison. Unable to do the deed, Peter gets Clive to handle it insisting she be allowed the luxury of one last sumptuous evening out. However, Rita is no fool. And things don't always go according to plan. Sometimes life just ain't that funny.","popularity":0.2772,"poster_path":"/hTshYrzIyUGuL5DO6KQymNTbbAn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161851,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leader Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clive Boomer's Success","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1039525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lili Simmons","original_name":"Lili Simmons","popularity":1.318,"profile_path":"/b03CjNTgZmSAKr9LnVVw0PFgqTH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rita","credit_id":"64ac3c20e24b930100c721a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romano Orzari","original_name":"Romano Orzari","popularity":0.2472,"profile_path":"/uXgDFJLWXIehw4Ea304QClle2Ai.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Peter Pisa","credit_id":"64ac3c2bb686b9010e0d2589","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1519978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monty Geer","original_name":"Monty Geer","popularity":0.1224,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Clive Boomer","credit_id":"64ac3c363e2ec800af7e8f80","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlo Liconti","original_name":"Carlo Liconti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ac3bf73e2ec8012ee49cf3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4155688,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Lawrence","original_name":"Charles Lawrence","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ac3c1066a0d300e374e40b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11572440","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hTshYrzIyUGuL5DO6KQymNTbbAn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
