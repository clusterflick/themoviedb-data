The parishioners eagerly await the moment to sing the liturgical hymns that the pastor skillfully leads. But today, he struggles to find the strength and faith to make a long-desired decision: to declare his love for one of his devoted parishioners. Music ends up giving him the vital push he needs to do so. On the run, liberated and full of joy, they leave the chapel holding hands in search of a new horizon, in the name of love.","popularity":0.0729,"poster_path":"/qCbc2hnNUDdJod7jwFBHb7zDKSm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Galician","iso_639_1":"gl","name":"Galego"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No nome do amor (C)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2110628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diego Anido","original_name":"Diego Anido","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/a7DVrZFjt8JjdPWfOTT93uRXOg8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66b33d9514601f49d8ccbdf8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabi Reboredo","original_name":"Gabi Reboredo","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66b33da57be3392514f1432c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Armans","original_name":"Manuel Armans","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"66b33db7c16ca91aa2cd6b4c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1381214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marta Pérez","original_name":"Marta Pérez","popularity":0.1152,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"66b33dcc9b7f48c1f7518c1a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4156223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xabier Mailán","original_name":"Xabier Mailán","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ac8892e24b9300c6b0160f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4156223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xabier Mailán","original_name":"Xabier Mailán","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b33ca124407bdf30f1451d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871746,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Raquel Payo","original_name":"Raquel Payo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b33d66b0ff9c9eff7b916c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4156223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xabier Mailán","original_name":"Xabier Mailán","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b33d420d3ecd24f127cef3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6kwDZOlOznb1bcytERtL6RHKSIO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"gl","file_path":"/qCbc2hnNUDdJod7jwFBHb7zDKSm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
