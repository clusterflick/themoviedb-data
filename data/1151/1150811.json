This film is about a square, but it is also about the problems involved in describing spaces that have become sites.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/sg51l0XmckJXsAUZbKmoawxIC0y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Plaza","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4157547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrés Agustí","original_name":"Andrés Agustí","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad96681cfe3a010184449c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28101405","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sg51l0XmckJXsAUZbKmoawxIC0y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
