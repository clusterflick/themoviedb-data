Patriarchal norms and traditions have transformed the inhabitants. Shpresa, only 17-year-old, suddenly reveals she is pregnant from a secret love affair. Shpresa's mom does her best to stop her daughter in giving birth to this baby. Sokol, Shpresa's father, unaware of his daughter's pregnancy, asks for the help of the village nurse, Theresa, as he thinks Shpresa is severely ill. The girl's mother puts the nurse ahead of an accomplished fact, to abort the child, who would permanently stain the family with shame, even if it risked her daughter's life.","popularity":0.0784,"poster_path":"/7ztIK6QzfpsimhtEwBEPBZIkq5V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AL","name":"Albania"}],"release_date":"2019-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gjyshja","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ema Andrea","original_name":"Ema Andrea","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"The Doctor","credit_id":"64ab56b0b686b90150105b47","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4154787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lule Colaj","original_name":"Lule Colaj","popularity":0.0422,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Grandmother","credit_id":"64ab56bcb686b900cc0a157f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4154788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marash Colaj","original_name":"Marash Colaj","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Grandfather","credit_id":"64ab56c76a3448014d327e7c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1407946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enxhi Cuku","original_name":"Enxhi Cuku","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/1GYxQcavyb0UfW5K5dPh9FDfF99.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Shpresa","credit_id":"64ab56d23e2ec8010dac37de","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3809853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mateo Curri","original_name":"Mateo Curri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Doctor's son","credit_id":"64ab56de66a0d300ade89aba","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4154791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mondi Curri","original_name":"Mondi Curri","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Driver","credit_id":"64ab56e966a0d3011d7bc075","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2391642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rita Gjeka","original_name":"Rita Gjeka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Shpresa's mum","credit_id":"64ab56f7e24b93013ab9bb24","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Çun Lajçi","original_name":"Çun Lajçi","popularity":0.2095,"profile_path":"/vOkZAeJqJPs8mJaYKf4uxZTHwSN.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Sokoli","credit_id":"64ab5702e24b930100c675bf","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4154793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julinda Ulaj","original_name":"Julinda Ulaj","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Sister","credit_id":"64ab570ffa78cd011cfae1bd","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3809845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduart Grishaj","original_name":"Eduart Grishaj","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ab568cb686b900cc0a1542","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3809848,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fatmira Nikolli","original_name":"Fatmira Nikolli","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ab569ed1a89300e2f9a279","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3809845,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduart Grishaj","original_name":"Eduart Grishaj","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ab5682d1a8930139d6cde0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11957762","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ztIK6QzfpsimhtEwBEPBZIkq5V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sq","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
