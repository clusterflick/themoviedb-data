But there is deep heartache ingrained below the surface of this postcard-perfect landscape: the rate of suicide among the region’s young First Nations men is alarmingly high. For Coles Smith, these terrible statistics – some of the most troubling in the world – are more than just numbers; his best friend tragically took his own life when they were in their 20s. Keeping Hope follows his intensely personal search for answers and, hopefully, solutions.","popularity":0.0665,"poster_path":"/7dodeKrSkeFygScKVP467fzCM9F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117786,"logo_path":"/huSRXDIBuQ0H4dShUB0YmEEu6Hc.png","name":"Joined Up Films","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2023-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mark Coles Smith faces down a traumatic event from his past in the hope of helping young First Nations men in the Kimberley.","title":"Keeping Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Coles Smith","original_name":"Mark Coles Smith","popularity":0.1439,"profile_path":"/8CA41CdtSnQwS2cWsJngQ7u09eB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"64ad71dd66a0d300e37598f0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tyson Mowarin","original_name":"Tyson Mowarin","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad71b6b686b9012f889fad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Coles Smith","original_name":"Mark Coles Smith","popularity":0.1439,"profile_path":"/8CA41CdtSnQwS2cWsJngQ7u09eB.jpg","credit_id":"64d13de2945d3600e266d413","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4122877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlikka Perdrisat","original_name":"Marlikka Perdrisat","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d13df0d8d32900af9fbb7d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3950130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darren Hutchinson","original_name":"Darren Hutchinson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d13df7d8d329013b9fcfa7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2300947,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacqueline Willinge","original_name":"Jacqueline Willinge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d13e07549dda00ffa4fed2","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4202839,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Brown","original_name":"Daniel Brown","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d13e6785090f01069283fd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1773670,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Torstein Dyrting","original_name":"Torstein Dyrting","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d13e776d4c9700ec58aa8b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3318371,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris Trappe","original_name":"Chris Trappe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d13e7e85090f00c87e1a48","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27833739","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sxZJWShkE1b9lo01NMpSfQHupzn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7dodeKrSkeFygScKVP467fzCM9F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
