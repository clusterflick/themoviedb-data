Is he having another breakdown? Like the one he had when he sold a record number of used cars in a year - he was awarded salesman of the year 9 years running. He lost his daughter - wife and stole and car - they found him buried naked on the side of the road ranting. Bob is trying for a comeback when a Snakegirl and Guitar Monte, street corner preachers, show up on the lot wanting to trade a boat for a Pontiac Trans AM - as any zealot car salesman will tell you - they don't take boats on trade. In the meantime his estranged daughter Turner shows up wanting to re-establish their relationship. Bob is hellbent on telling the truth about all the cars on his lot. And no one is prepared for the truth. Sell Truth becomes his sales pitch. And no one is ever going to be the same again.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"God Drives a Pontiac","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0339076","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
