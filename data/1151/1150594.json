Unfortunately, since March 11, 2011, \"Fukushima\" has been superseded by another name: Nuclear Disaster Zone. Six years have passed, but over 80,000 Fukushima residents still cannot return home, still cannot return to their former lives. How did they get through it? Reconstruction work is slow. Several years on, surrounding the site of the Fukushima nuclear incident, there remain many refuge-seeking residents whose homes are still in lockdown. In the streets, people are taking it to their own hands to save their communities. Psychologically and practically, how does one rebuild? Does the civil society's self-rescue mission conclude in recovering what was lost, or in reviving an even better community? In their eyes, what is \"revival\"? What is the meaning of \"rebirth\"? Our crew went all over the coastal areas of Fukushima, recording stories of residents each finding their own ways to save themselves.","popularity":0.2201,"poster_path":"/mRM2YXfcaBhBIlEBXxFwHXMuzoD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":203864,"logo_path":null,"name":"STAND NEWS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2017-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"311 Revival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"日本","title":"311復興と再生","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4156829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarisse YEUNG","original_name":"Clarisse YEUNG","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"64ad11c466a0d3013a7419b2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4156825,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Shirley WONG","original_name":"Shirley WONG","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad0fe266a0d3011d7cbf38","department":"Art","job":"Title Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4156820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth TAM","original_name":"Ruth TAM","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad0fd0e24b93013abac831","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4156826,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martina MAK","original_name":"Martina MAK","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad10f9b686b9012f886ad3","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4156828,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Horatio TSOI","original_name":"Horatio TSOI","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad116e8a0e9b00e37511e0","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4156827,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Real CHEUNG","original_name":"Real CHEUNG","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad113ae24b93011d74da61","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7356714","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2w5js8wD1ZfxpUBqrARng55owPd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.755,"height":885,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/mRM2YXfcaBhBIlEBXxFwHXMuzoD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":668}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233,"name":"japan"},{"id":261656,"name":"nuclear disaster"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"【311 復興與再生】","key":"cSk7KydYnYs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-06-13T16:45:48.000Z","id":"64ad12853e2ec800cbcf7835"}]}}}
