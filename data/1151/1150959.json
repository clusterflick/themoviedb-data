Set on their lush private island (Greenaway Island), the film covers diverse topics such as the historical relevance of servants, the hidden agenda behind US politics, spirituality and religion. The Gilberts argue for tradition, marriage, and faith in God. In probing these subjects, Greenaway transcends the personal realm to become universal and provocative.","popularity":0.0972,"poster_path":"/s2lpR7SSlXGeAnXiT4atttcqMIb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146937,"logo_path":null,"name":"Abrakadabra Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greenaway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Greenaway: An Intimate Portrait of Old-Money Wealth","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5311520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Gilbert","original_name":"Alice Gilbert","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67d8b1c0a2f6cc77948590a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5311521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin D.
