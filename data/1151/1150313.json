Van Gasteren became fascinated by the Nagele project, and followed it from the drawing board and models to the construction of this new community. The final result is the film A New Village on New Land from 1960 â€“ the year in which the first residents moved into their new, modern homes. Among the early pioneers in Nagele were many farmers who were to cultivate the newly reclaimed land.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/ydFVVx6sIYpXisNkWQaBSGvkhnl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spectrum Film","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A New Village on New Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4155570,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bert van der Pijpekamp","original_name":"Bert van der Pijpekamp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ac261d66a0d3013a739711","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1474106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis van Gasteren","original_name":"Louis van Gasteren","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/vlQEikWPOQFRUq8ZDxLwGb5cfhR.jpg","credit_id":"64ac25293e2ec800af7e860a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4155566,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jan van Vuure","original_name":"Jan van Vuure","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ac25f08a0e9b0100c3d1b8","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1474106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis van Gasteren","original_name":"Louis van Gasteren","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/vlQEikWPOQFRUq8ZDxLwGb5cfhR.jpg","credit_id":"64ac2545b686b900cc0aa920","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4155563,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"J.W.
