The story is told from the point of view of a Canadian flight engineer who has been injured in a plane crash. The onlooker lives with the young airman through the whole process of his physical treatment, his social readjustment during convalescence, his appearance in public again, his treatment by English friends and, finally, his boarding the boat for home, hope and anxiety struggling in his heart. Some of his old buddies are on the deck. They not only recognize him but welcome him joyously. We know that if the home folks do as well, his chances for a happy return are good.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1946-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Faces Come Back","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1591113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Paquette","original_name":"Vincent Paquette","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"657c53998e2ba600c4f183d2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4157118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Davis","original_name":"Richard Davis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad5199e24b93011d750293","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0289750","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1946-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
