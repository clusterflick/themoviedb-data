Seeking to overcome his personal crisis, a renowned stage and screen actor Petro returns from the capital city to his native village to create a theatre with his fellow villagers, thus proving to himself what he is still capable of. After a decade of fame, a small troupe is tired. It is increasingly difficult for the director to find actors for new theatrical productions. The choice falls on Chekhov's vaudeville for three actors. On stage - the director, the director's wife and the director's childhood friend, the head of the club. Summer heat. Serenity. Six months before the war.","popularity":0.1156,"poster_path":"/7anIqQkXxuXMUXYIfj4eQmreDF4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Demiurge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4157103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Semak","original_name":"Olga Semak","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad4b67b686b9012f888bd8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2442272,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Viktor Maliarenko","original_name":"Viktor Maliarenko","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/s4gmDFAJC1OMlCXgf31Y1XVpJn1.jpg","credit_id":"64ad4bd58a0e9b011d8cca78","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4157105,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Serhiy Syvko","original_name":"Serhiy Syvko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad4b953e2ec800cbcf9a5c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1473919,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Techynskyi","original_name":"Oleksandr Techynskyi","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/ksDuZyzUGfOJT9Ytr2uM74ue32O.jpg","credit_id":"64ad4bc06a3448012ce6b7fe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4157104,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olena Semak","original_name":"Olena Semak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad4b82e24b9300e32856cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27903985","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"DemiurgeDoc","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7anIqQkXxuXMUXYIfj4eQmreDF4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1425},{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":2300,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/dKGi7ks67txXfNYJIxTBsZhLOQn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Bulgarian Edition","release_date":"2024-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Galway Film Fleadh","release_date":"2023-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Odesa International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Ukrainian Edition","release_date":"2024-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
