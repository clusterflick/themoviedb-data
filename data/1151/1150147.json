Faced with yet again another family dinner discussion, Sam gets annoyed with Sams mother who just doesn’t understand that Sam is just not the little girl anymore who loved wearing dresses. Sam flees to a night club. There, during that night, in the safe space of the women’s restroom, Sam encounters the stories of other women. Some passed by the doorman, while others did not. Someone sits helpless in the locked cubicle, not daring to go out. Two women kiss passionately, protected from the gaze of others. For all of them, this night in the club means something different, but they are all united by the longing for a safe place where they can escape life for a moment.","popularity":0.0889,"poster_path":"/eq8AskqRly9SggKm380sL1R9pxA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"it's
