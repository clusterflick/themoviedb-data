What has Nagele become? He interviews residents and local officials and sees that over the course of fifty years, this model village has changed dramatically. The world turned out not to be as makeable as previously thought, and adjustments have had to be made on all fronts. The homes were too small, social cohesiveness is under strain and the original ideas, based on ideals, seem outdated. Van Gasteren also gets architects such as Umberto Barbieri and architectural historian Ed Taverne to speak, looking back at the work and ideals of their predecessors.","popularity":0.0461,"poster_path":"/xzd2BGd3OgOaguvaUvywhDJlf1f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spectrum
