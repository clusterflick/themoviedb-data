Tommy should be hungry, but he just picks at his food. Going back to early babyhood, the film traces in detail, how eating habits are formed, how individual likes and dislikes must be taken into consideration, and that the worst habit of all is the permanent battle over food. After this analysis, Tommy still sits by his well-filled plate. In despair his mother takes him to the doctor, who explains that she is really the problem. She realizes that she has been tense, impatient with Tommy from the start. Now it will take painstaking care to build a new atmosphere of cooperation and friendliness, to learn understanding of Tommy's personal requirements at mealtimes, and all the time.","popularity":0.0347,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1948-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Won't Tommy Eat?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1995106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judith Crawley","original_name":"Judith Crawley","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64adbc9a8a0e9b013afdcde5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0283142","wikidata_id":"Q123287775","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1948-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
