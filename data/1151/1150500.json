Relaxing on a bench in the garden of Copenhagen's Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Krag is scrutinised by camera-wielding collective members almost like a model in a life-drawing class. Every possible angle, distance and framing is tried. The result is an image of the prime minister that is both fragmented and multi-facetted, describing his visual appearance as a man and an icon. At the same time, the ABCinema members film each other filming Krag, which gives the film a highly self-reflective character. Like \"The Deer Garden,\" this is a film about a film being filmed. A showdown with the documentary portrait genre, \"Jens Otto Krag\" is devised according to the principle of keeping the material alive by not editing it but randomly piecing it together.
