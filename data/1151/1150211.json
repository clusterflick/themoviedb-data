But today, they live anonymously, and in many cases, in poverty - their groundbreaking contributions to sport ignored by the men who've written boxing history. This feature documentary uncovers the hidden origins of women's boxing, and the remarkable story of the pioneering women who put their lives of the line to earn the right to fight each other in the ring. This is an inspirational story, but it is not a hagiography - the narrative takes dark and surprising twists and turns as the women's stories unfold in unexpected ways.","popularity":0.111,"poster_path":"/8sreMh576ppGF9wcYRPlxvzVWME.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23949,"logo_path":"/3QFwomSxcZZgMQGBkdUPuJEnSFB.png","name":"RAW","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Right to Fight","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4171667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marian Trimiar","original_name":"Marian Trimiar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64b91c186aa8e000ed9b6cba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4171668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Pineda","original_name":"Pat Pineda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64b91c3f27db6100ff8fbff6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3316846,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georgina Cammalleri","original_name":"Georgina Cammalleri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64abe1e73e2ec800cbcec2c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28405986","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uaXCXRoR5n0LjA70dg0wmS51nwm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8sreMh576ppGF9wcYRPlxvzVWME.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Women Make Waves International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer","key":"BJX0fZ-f-2s","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-07-13T14:16:44.000Z","id":"65b295d3fd140b00c7a06edc"}]}}}
