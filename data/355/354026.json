All the senses are concentrated in this one head: eyes, ears, nose, lips, tongue and the skin which covers all with its network of vibrating nerves. One imagines the senses, the counterpart of our own, ready to respond with all the various moods, suggestions and agreements. Through the eyes alone, when placed in contact with our own, a visual dialogue and interplay is embarked upon. And when the lips, two bodies fitting together in perfect harmony, break into a smile, they invite further exploration. Then, with the engagement of time, this dialogue shifts from speculation to realization. The face transforms from its abstract suggestiveness to the singular projection of seduction. It is no longer anyones face; it is the face of one particular person\" (Stephen Dwoskin)","popularity":0.0563,"poster_path":"/4Gg0L9JpnoJZNDeaPk4O5f59Mc6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Face Anthea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304690,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anthea Kennedy","original_name":"Anthea Kennedy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ad19286c3a3683ef9007f4b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Dwoskin","original_name":"Stephen Dwoskin","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":"/czK2KmlaMJtYOHQeebFlshC8ku6.jpg","credit_id":"55c9d0bfc3a36875200014ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4Gg0L9JpnoJZNDeaPk4O5f59Mc6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
