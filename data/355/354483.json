These sites are connected by the fact that each is located by the sea. Seamlessly combining travelogue footage and appropriated clips from feature films, BEACON produces a single, imaginary locale. Distant echoes of stories of the sea mingle with the banality of today's touristy beachlife. In its collage of places of expectation and with its seductive prospects of the sea, Beacon sets off on a journey with no distinct destination.","popularity":0.0902,"poster_path":"/f1X2dxXvSoSH6Kdchg11ujooLtx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85264,"logo_path":null,"name":"Curtas-Metragens, CRL","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beacon","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Zeichen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3396496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allison Plath-Moseley","original_name":"Allison Plath-Moseley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"61ef28a0ea37e001143cab1d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210609,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Girardet","original_name":"Christoph Girardet","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/bLGMBVZTtTgsrmchLHPtmmrVH9J.jpg","credit_id":"55cd8d3692514131a5001405","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201127,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthias Müller","original_name":"Matthias Müller","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":"/gi38yN87M4mgcsNCkViWLCeVXnV.jpg","credit_id":"55cd8d2b9251412e5100049b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201127,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthias Müller","original_name":"Matthias Müller","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":"/gi38yN87M4mgcsNCkViWLCeVXnV.jpg","credit_id":"61ef28281ad93b00e9129b68","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210609,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Girardet","original_name":"Christoph Girardet","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/bLGMBVZTtTgsrmchLHPtmmrVH9J.jpg","credit_id":"61ef2820c5ada50044de8d8b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201127,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthias Müller","original_name":"Matthias Müller","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":"/gi38yN87M4mgcsNCkViWLCeVXnV.jpg","credit_id":"61ef282fe9da6900c41e7e7f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210609,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Girardet","original_name":"Christoph Girardet","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/bLGMBVZTtTgsrmchLHPtmmrVH9J.jpg","credit_id":"61ef28189e4586010731537a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Hoolboom","original_name":"Mike Hoolboom","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/kFXKkmtIUsD5efHwk7h43qaSPSv.jpg","credit_id":"61ef28545a78840044928e03","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0403869","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/f1X2dxXvSoSH6Kdchg11ujooLtx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1wQ9D2bykxYK2mC2BNM3eSryWlO.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
