It was originally released in three parts, all of which were long thought to be lost until portions of the second part and much of the third part were discovered and restored in 1991. Since the film had once been voted in a 1959 Kinema Junpō poll as the best Japanese film of all time, its discovery was significant. At the time of its release, Itō was the leader of a new style of samurai films that featured outlaw heroes and fast-cut sword fighting scenes.","popularity":0.2847,"poster_path":"/8if31OIdNc6JzjbOlSnc52J52Yp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":955,"logo_path":"/5xnXD3PJI1HqOJceSAKZ3fDqO1V.png","name":"Nikkatsu Corporation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1927-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chuji's Travel Diary: Story of Bloody Shinshu","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Chuji tabi nikki: Shinshu kessho hen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denjirō Ōkōchi","original_name":"大河内傳次郎","popularity":0.2484,"profile_path":"/yegq1bccLpW4ZRCRTuzOGBhBpSM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"610096901b7294004510765d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1551735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seinosuke Sakamoto","original_name":"Seinosuke Sakamoto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"610096c233ec2600467f059d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haruo Okazaki","original_name":"Haruo Okazaki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6100971e1b72940074ba2c1f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1282063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"En'ichirō Jitsukawa","original_name":"實川延一郎","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/dA5SWrDvuyVRkIAxWunRpprsNG4.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61009743e24b930048fc7a5a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1551734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideo Nakamura","original_name":"Hideo Nakamura","popularity":0.098,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6100a4cfe24b930075c44400","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1472318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kichiji Nakamura","original_name":"Kichiji Nakamura","popularity":0.0626,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6100a5291684f7002e1482e5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3148084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Masakazu Yukawa","original_name":"Masakazu Yukawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e4844684591c0074b5d534","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3148083,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rokuzo Wataai","original_name":"Rokuzo Wataai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e4842b6bdec300460960ca","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daisuke Itō","original_name":"伊藤大輔","popularity":0.2862,"profile_path":"/cx7M1NXgGeIiF44uEZ7Dqfp4fTC.jpg","credit_id":"60e483916ee3d7005e4e8478","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daisuke Itō","original_name":"伊藤大輔","popularity":0.2862,"profile_path":"/cx7M1NXgGeIiF44uEZ7Dqfp4fTC.jpg","credit_id":"55ce278cc3a3681bfc00262e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0432794","wikidata_id":"Q105439598","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/8if31OIdNc6JzjbOlSnc52J52Yp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1335}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1927-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
