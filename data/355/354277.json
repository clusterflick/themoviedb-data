Any further evidence of the title’s confusing ‘awfulness’ – other than the literal disentanglement of the line remains, however, tentative, left as it were, literally, at a loose end. The viewer knows nothing of the incident that led to this backlash or entanglement; nor of the directors’ initial motive for the title indeed not of any other attempt at blending an additional storyline beyond what is seen. There is, perhaps, one link with a reverse reaction – a sense of gradual recovery taking place, as the thread unfolds from a position of multiplicity back to a singular line.” (Pamela Kember, Rethinking Refunctioning, ‘Awful Backlash’ catalogue, May 2000)  Preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2005.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/aegGn8pEoUM5lSYcwUmaZgXmWJd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Awful Backlash","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1098558,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Nelson","original_name":"Robert Nelson","popularity":0.0754,"profile_path":"/mZ6rnSsoNwAylw71LougAInj8vw.jpg","credit_id":"55cc40279251417648002000","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13842420","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aegGn8pEoUM5lSYcwUmaZgXmWJd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309397,"name":"preserved film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
