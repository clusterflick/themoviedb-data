Held for decades in a psychiatric institute, Quick's confessions emerged after years working with a group of touchy feely therapists, convinced that the recovery of memories would cure patients of their criminality. In a country with a low crime rate, the nation watched with horror as Quick's confessions mounted, accounting for many of the country's unsolved murders. With testimonials from a range of people whose lives have been dominated by this story - including Quick himself - and dramatic reenactment, Brian Hill weaves a stylish noir thriller that works a treat on the big screen. What appears at first to be a tale of unimaginable evil evolves into something much more layered as Hill digs deep into the motivations behind those working closely with Quick.","popularity":0.2104,"poster_path":"/5BMTaKhJbOuIs61mtaQlEuOCoUm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6705,"logo_path":"/iNB1FCwT4XjO6wkN3PnpPnwr9GX.png","name":"Film4
