His early studies of class-divided Britain were followed by the postwar series of \"distorted nudes\", shot on beaches and inside rooms. The film is a fitting final portrait of Brandt (it was completed in the year he died), and recomposes his work in cinematic terms. The camera moves through an apartment where the pictures were taken, to reveal photographs scattered 'in situ'. These are panned to show the surrounding space, the angle of vision and a model who reconstructs Brandt's original image. Dwoskin emphasises visual atmosphere through the language of the eye.","popularity":0.0499,"poster_path":"/n4TN4X6GiC3o8Cx9fpVLRlgAKmB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stephen Dwoskin Films","origin_country":""},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1983-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadows from Light","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Shadows from Light: The Photography of Bill Brandt","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1073772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cosey Fanni Tutti","original_name":"Cosey Fanni Tutti","popularity":2.872,"profile_path":"/7NKwW3DuBXotVWVzb0fpPSh4ZFk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"580b7da8c3a368296400b80a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Brandt","original_name":"Bill Brandt","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"580b7ebfc3a3682413002e8e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Dwoskin","original_name":"Stephen Dwoskin","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":"/czK2KmlaMJtYOHQeebFlshC8ku6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"580b7ed5c3a368296400b891","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Dwoskin","original_name":"Stephen Dwoskin","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":"/czK2KmlaMJtYOHQeebFlshC8ku6.jpg","credit_id":"55c9d1379251410c4600178c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0086296","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1757,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n4TN4X6GiC3o8Cx9fpVLRlgAKmB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1170},{"aspect_ratio":0.721,"height":2732,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tb8WvvdeJ9o2egOklPtBPqqfSrw.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1969}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
