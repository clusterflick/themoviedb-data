With scale models built of paper, digital animation and live action, it reconstructs a passenger’s memory of a plane crash.  Early morning, December 27th 1991. Flight 751 is taking off from Stockholm-Arlanda. 13-year old Sandro is looking forward to spending his Christmas holiday in Japan. At 1,000 meters altitude violent explosions are heard from both sides of the plane. The engines go quiet and they are silently gliding through the air. The pilots are forced to make an emergency landing and the plane crashes on a snow-capped field near the small village of Gottröra. The flight lasted 4 minutes, but the memory lasts a lifetime. Sandro narrates the story about the day he was about to die.","popularity":0.3053,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2014-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Memories of a Surviving Passenger","title":"Seat 26D","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandro","original_name":"Sandro","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"55ca0e25c3a3687523001e4c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":396609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadja Weiss","original_name":"Nadja Weiss","popularity":0.3103,"profile_path":"/lSChncsWtrPF3IhVePT7xxlJnHy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"55ca0e35c3a368597b001292","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Jern","original_name":"Michel Jern","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55ca0e40c3a3687523001e52","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lefteris Ballatsas","original_name":"Lefteris Ballatsas","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55ca0e4ac3a3687527001b75","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Bengtsson","original_name":"Julia Bengtsson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"55ca0e51c3a368751b001a93","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tarik Saleh","original_name":"Tarik Saleh","popularity":0.3207,"profile_path":"/6sZK0JLzcjgEmG8uxvAIdoGFOCH.jpg","credit_id":"6283de710859b400508b872d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":584835,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kristina Åberg","original_name":"Kristina Åberg","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/6PNWUbfS9woBBTYZc0Yw8ryB12V.jpg","credit_id":"55ca0e7fc3a368751b001a9d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karolina Brobäck","original_name":"Karolina Brobäck","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55ca0e6f9251410c58001ba1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495930,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Anton Thorsson","original_name":"Anton Thorsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55ca0e8f9251410c46001d81","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1756874,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anna Bertmark","original_name":"Anna Bertmark","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/bmTm5Id86gFY70oUTNsNItFhjgW.jpg","credit_id":"6600aa6a04733f017dee09f0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3454006","wikidata_id":"Q50225213","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Seat 26D - Trailer","key":"256203721","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-02-17T12:45:34.000Z","id":"5ceb9504c3a3682e9323180a"}]}}}
