He is trying to form a band with his best friend, Grondin, a drummer, barstool poet and radio host. Their lead singer Joe has just left them to join rival band Les Hypsters, which leads them to recruit the laconically enigmatic bass player Kundera. Hovering around them are Murder, a carless pizza delivery boy, wandering poets and a colourfully eccentric thirty-something clientele.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Limoilou","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgar Fritz","original_name":"Edgar Fritz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55cd5b4a9251413193000fb0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4840120","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
