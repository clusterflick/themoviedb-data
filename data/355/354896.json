He then proceeds to pull several cards out of mid air and arrange them on the floor. Then, taking a banjo he multiplies himself into seven different troubadours, each playing a different musical instrument. A moment later, they all vanish and we are left with the troubadour who we were first introduced to at the beginning of the film. He explodes in a puff of smoke, and an enormous fan appears and unfolds. On it appears a vision of a castle tower with a maiden in it, and the troubadour outside the tower window, talking to her. The vision dissolves, and the troubadour bows, thus ending his performance.","popularity":0.0574,"poster_path":"/6NUdQp4ibmpHSD2VD19nyiXbbfI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1906-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Troubadour","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1121182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabrielle Robinne","original_name":"Gabrielle Robinne","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"55d1a9da92514142b4006e9a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Segundo de Chomón","original_name":"Segundo de Chomón","popularity":0.206,"profile_path":"/3iCsGlo1XUbvy61411fMHb8bZdP.jpg","credit_id":"55d1a9e8925141319f00a1d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0449434","wikidata_id":"Q104413416","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6NUdQp4ibmpHSD2VD19nyiXbbfI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1906-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1906-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
