As songs accumulated, Beau realized the need to further explore the source of his inspiration, and a plan was hatched to travel the U.S. retracing Will Rogers' footsteps, performing songs about Will at locations where significant events in his life took place. Beau decided that the performances should be filmed for the creation of a feature-length documentary film and accompanying album with the working title The Verdigris - a reference to the river that runs through Will's hometown of Oologah, OK and through Beau's hometown of Inola, OK.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/xMDDnKfOVilzfl8K7J7cfhRFOMT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162172,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aviation Cinemas Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Verdigris: In Search of Will Rogers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beau Jennings","original_name":"Beau Jennings","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"615e91c322f5d70043f48195","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3261505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allan Vest","original_name":"Allan Vest","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"615e91ca245dbe002997c928","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beau Jennings","original_name":"Beau Jennings","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615e915769eb900061def66e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1298678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Steele","original_name":"Eric Steele","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615e916e899da20061eac445","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":979445,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Donaghey","original_name":"Adam Donaghey","popularity":0.0622,"profile_path":"/ztDjo8QHafD2BdZxCOP2YFf4xp5.jpg","credit_id":"615e915f67e0f7002ace7cef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1080294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Pyland","original_name":"Jack Pyland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615e91abaa659e0086c00e16","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beau Jennings","original_name":"Beau Jennings","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55cd6d3fc3a3681bf90012b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bradley Beesley","original_name":"Bradley Beesley","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55cd6d5ec3a3681567000ec8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3823790","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xMDDnKfOVilzfl8K7J7cfhRFOMT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Dead Center Film Festival","release_date":"2015-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Verdigris: In Search of Will Rogers - Official Trailer","key":"yrJIbNorYoU","published_at":"2015-08-04T20:32:56.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"55cd6cde92514131980011ed"}]}}}
