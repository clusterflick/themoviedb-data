Unni accepts Devaki as his wife and brings her into the fold of his Namboothiri illam. Bound by a plethora of traditional beliefs, customs and rituals that constitute life within four walls of the joint family, Unni is unable to be the husband that he would have liked to be. Yet, they understand and love each other immensely. Guarded by the fortress of tradition, the family remains oblivious to the winds of change sweeping through society. Though Unni is aware, he shuts the door to everything that his family will never be able to comprehend or accept. But Devaki, who is essentially of a different mould, longs to step out into the world â€” and is finally forced to do so.","popularity":0.2883,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1999-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Agnisaakshi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Agni Sakshi","type":"alternative spelling"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Agnisakshi","type":"alternative spelling"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajit Kapoor","original_name":"Rajit Kapoor","popularity":0.2539,"profile_path":"/mATIzHiXTeW6xB8IoJVLTD5NDMn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"592f26dac3a36852f00022b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":110298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shobana","original_name":"Shobana","popularity":1.0039,"profile_path":"/t6niRFC3xCV6hJSuyC9ACWLSVXu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"57211290c3a3681193000925","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":584248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Srividya","original_name":"Srividya","popularity":0.4611,"profile_path":"/iQ5uS9zImGAGSXVW97t7tY871Q9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5721129992514144940008fd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":973674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Praveena","original_name":"Praveena","popularity":0.1872,"profile_path":"/gFMQzuudrxexXMuUUY0FzQzdkiK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"572112a1c3a368118700095d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shyamaprasad","original_name":"Shyamaprasad","popularity":0.1878,"profile_path":"/7XmS8tF5OGt7y9YdpyySIWBECkH.jpg","credit_id":"57211276c3a3681181000aa8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1077263,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bina Paul","original_name":"Beena Paul","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/2haoqsoajyjElCvJFum1kt9nN5d.jpg","credit_id":"5fac41c71dbc88003df4531a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0205727","wikidata_id":"Q4693263","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Karlovy Vary International Film Festival","release_date":"1999-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
