This dilemma can be summarized as her basic inability to have relationships, especially sustained relationships, and particularly with men. This is the total of her statement and the film. The construction and flow of the film follows the way she thinks - it is her point of view that is followed in the film. So all things are the way she remembers and dwells on them, and which are important to her.' - S.D.","popularity":0.1048,"poster_path":"/mEh2nIXMSQY99SryZVWTeRlW1er.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":162808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stephen Dwoskin Films","origin_country":""},{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1977-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Silent Cry","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1537298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Brightmore","original_name":"Ernest Brightmore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"616dd12390dde0002b61ed7d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2052876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Béatrice Cordua","original_name":"Béatrice Cordua","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"616dd13113a3200044dee841","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1073772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cosey Fanni Tutti","original_name":"Cosey Fanni Tutti","popularity":2.872,"profile_path":"/7NKwW3DuBXotVWVzb0fpPSh4ZFk.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6338fd332b113d007ae7aedb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Gill","original_name":"Bobby Gill","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"616dd1521e922500427df20c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1537286,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patsy Nightingale","original_name":"Patsy Nightingale","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"616dd1641e92250093ec7809","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1881399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Rose","original_name":"Mary Rose","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"616dd178894ed60064635c36","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lou Spain","original_name":"Lou Spain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"616dd18613a320009316b6eb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2064687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harald Waistnage","original_name":"Harald Waistnage","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"616dd194160e730029846bea","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Dwoskin","original_name":"Stephen Dwoskin","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":"/czK2KmlaMJtYOHQeebFlshC8ku6.jpg","credit_id":"616dd1c3df86a80043628e70","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2211817,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benedict Mason","original_name":"Benedict Mason","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616dd1ad160e73008efbd508","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Dwoskin","original_name":"Stephen Dwoskin","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":"/czK2KmlaMJtYOHQeebFlshC8ku6.jpg","credit_id":"55c9d1ddc3a368752f001890","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0076712","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1151,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gZShiauI1DN1B2kLt2gTsQGLF9D.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2047}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mEh2nIXMSQY99SryZVWTeRlW1er.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
