That's why he decides, as a testament destined to his retired father, to have himself filmed in the places he and his parents used to go to for their Sunday escapades when he was a kid. But, after leaving Bastogne, he hears on the radio that Marc Dutroux, the pedophile-torturer-murderer has just escaped the police forces. Totally upset, Didier decides to fork off to Grâce-Hologne, a little village close to Liège, to protect a potential victim of Dutroux.","popularity":0.1662,"poster_path":"/yapehWahkVSuOXKfMKzCTUoN1mB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11796,"logo_path":"/tx6LOQcTSqgW8ffKxovuJHjlYVw.png","name":"Centre du Cinéma et de l'Audiovisuel de la FWB","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":127671,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Fondation Joseph Jacquemotte","origin_country":""},{"id":127672,"logo_path":null,"name":"Latitudes Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":127673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Amis du Travelling","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1999-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Travellinckx","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Didier Toupy","original_name":"Didier Toupy","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/vkvVXwn7hokppznSIWKv7jZtPhq.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Didier","credit_id":"5e1b056fe194b00016b58fa0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bouli Lanners","original_name":"Bouli Lanners","popularity":0.8133,"profile_path":"/z8rZxXU57hC66ixj28LO3cUCh2f.jpg","credit_id":"5e1b04c46c19ea0013923885","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2507891,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Philippe Bluard","original_name":"Philippe Bluard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1b050fe194b00012b59013","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2507890,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jean-Paul Dezaetijd","original_name":"Jean-Paul Dezaetijd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1b04f93520e80017357f16","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bouli Lanners","original_name":"Bouli Lanners","popularity":0.8133,"profile_path":"/z8rZxXU57hC66ixj28LO3cUCh2f.jpg","credit_id":"5e1b04d4e194b00012b58fa3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35889,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Philippe Bourgueil","original_name":"Philippe Bourgueil","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/cGje6nAzKE0fd4xXD4NRMIX2htS.jpg","credit_id":"5e1b051bd5dbc20013f19592","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2507889,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean-François Lemaire","original_name":"Jean-François Lemaire","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1b04e3e7c097001552f688","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":969004,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacques-Henri Bronckart","original_name":"Jacques-Henri Bronckart","popularity":0.1092,"profile_path":"/qCxqKIVN2OEOfq044rkKIR2F9yh.jpg","credit_id":"5e1b0543e7c097001552f737","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2507892,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jarby McCoy","original_name":"Jarby McCoy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1b052f6c19ea00119247b1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0217856","wikidata_id":"Q3538190","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1820,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yapehWahkVSuOXKfMKzCTUoN1mB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1999-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
