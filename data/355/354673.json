Now unemployed, Yamato lives in a very humble apartment room. He lost his family by the crime he committed with the urge he himself couldn’t and even now can explain. He has nowhere to go, and becomes isolated in the big city. His continuous job search is unsuccessful, and one day he meets a young girl Kaoru who is passing out advertisement packaged with free tissue to the crowd at a train station. He aggressively gets involved with her. The two immediately feel the mutual isolation and desperation within themselves. These are youngsters with no purpose in their lives, symbolizing the Japanese society which passed the post-war economic peak period. Yamato and Kaoru go down the road of destruction, being sucked into the deep, dark ditch of society. Filling the screen images both stark and surreal, director Ataru Oikawa draws an unadulterated portrait of youth.","popularity":0.279,"poster_path":"/5KUxaHtWuWjlElyGnlbfm2oIMR1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1995-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boy Made in Japan","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Nippon sei shônen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikio Osawa","original_name":"大沢樹生","popularity":0.3658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Yamato Tanaka","credit_id":"55cf14efc3a36858750019d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1497124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaori Shimada","original_name":"Kaori Shimada","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kaoru","credit_id":"55cf14f892514142b4001ae6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2648553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuyoshi Suzuki","original_name":"Kazuyoshi Suzuki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec75b55e635710021cc71fd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2648554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shoji Mari","original_name":"Shoji Mari","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec75b639979d2001f35014a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ataru Oikawa","original_name":"及川中","popularity":0.1513,"profile_path":"/782ufwdwCIcRoRBk0wzlvUqhRar.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5ec75bd99979d2001f3501bd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ataru Oikawa","original_name":"及川中","popularity":0.1513,"profile_path":"/782ufwdwCIcRoRBk0wzlvUqhRar.jpg","credit_id":"55cf150c925141319600460b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ataru Oikawa","original_name":"及川中","popularity":0.1513,"profile_path":"/782ufwdwCIcRoRBk0wzlvUqhRar.jpg","credit_id":"55cf1513c3a3681bf0003e6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1497125,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Etsuko Kanno","original_name":"Etsuko Kanno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55cf1521c3a3681bf5004a7f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1497126,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hiroshi Futami","original_name":"Hiroshi Futami","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55cf152e92514131a5004505","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135383,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hideo Yamamoto","original_name":"山本英夫","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/4x5jWPZgLMn1eNCiQVEZWltwWAa.jpg","credit_id":"5ec6cd026c849200212a9eb4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647820,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Akira Kiyoshi Okada","original_name":"Akira Kiyoshi Okada","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ec6cd149979d200213888ed","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4883048","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5KUxaHtWuWjlElyGnlbfm2oIMR1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
