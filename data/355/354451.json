The approach is literary experimental with optical effects. There are three mental states that are interesting: amnesia, euphoria and ecstasy. Amnesia is not knowing who you are and wanting desperately to know. I call this the White Night. Euphoria is not knowing who you are and not caring. This is the Dream of Meditation. Ecstasy is knowing exactly who you are and still not caring. I call this the Memory of the Future. This is an autobiographical film funded by the American Film Institute.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/k5hblOH9FcUJH6tof7Fk7bIiAO2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elasticity","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chick Strand","original_name":"Chick Strand","popularity":0.0685,"profile_path":"/zkQadrWgQ1da8zqnbjrshuBJSkt.jpg","credit_id":"55cd60f49251413196001075","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1723636","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.692,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k5hblOH9FcUJH6tof7Fk7bIiAO2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":830}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"California Museum of Science and Industry","release_date":"1975-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
