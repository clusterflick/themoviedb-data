The events of that fateful voyage are told through dramatised contemporary accounts. These are enhanced by an extensive interview with survivor Eva Hart MBE, who was a girl of seven at the time.  This is not only the story of a great tragedy, but also of Edward John Smith a potter’s son who rose from the backstreets of Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, to become the premier sea captain of his day. Don Smith shows us some of Captain Smith’s possessions, handed down through the family.  It is also the story of how such a terrible disaster can be turned into something of national pride by the press of the day. Pride in a captain and crew who could uphold the great traditions of the sea captured in Captain Smith’s last call from the bridge of the doomed ship. Be British!.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gyHt8WTKcZrOSOF27J4wdnn2lkH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Titanic: The Captain of the Titanic","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Story of Edward J.
