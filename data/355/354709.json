Music has always been a central character in Cirque du Soleil shows. It accompanies the artists, punctuates the performance and triggers emotions. The 75-minute concert will pay tribute to the music of Cirque du Soleil and will feature a choir of 70 voices (under the artistic direction of Gregory Charles) and 6 soloists accompanied by 28 musicians. The audience will hear singers Paul Bisson, Audrey Brisson-Jutras, Dominic Dagenais, Estelle Esse, Mathieu Lavoie, Anna Liani, Francine Poitras and Roxanne Potvin interpret some of the songs that have defined the music of Cirque du Soleil shows of the past 30 years.","popularity":0.2068,"poster_path":"/frRvDhDAzAzd2OCMNldGXB3IOqo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":24005,"logo_path":"/9XhPYLpXbWHFwp8fpKFN9jU8zvH.png","name":"Écho
