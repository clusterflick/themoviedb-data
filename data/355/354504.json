The video pulses violently from one bouquet of red roses to another, focusing on their unifying similarities. Animating still photography into moving images, Promises zooms into the very centre of the images – single buds – in a nervous, flickering rhythm, as if it were searching for a message hidden deep under the surface. By mere means of editing, the meticulously arranged bouquets seem to explode in aggressive eruptions.","popularity":0.0635,"poster_path":"/Uundyc2xVE2Cqm8RPNVH3DU8be.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Promises","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201127,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthias Müller","original_name":"Matthias Müller","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":"/gi38yN87M4mgcsNCkViWLCeVXnV.jpg","credit_id":"55cd97bf9251412e510005b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Uundyc2xVE2Cqm8RPNVH3DU8be.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
