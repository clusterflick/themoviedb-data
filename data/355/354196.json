Lucier explains and comments on his œuvre – from his early live electronics performances (MUSIC FOR SOLO PERFORMER,1965 and BIRD AND PERSON DYNING, 1975) up to the premiere of his ensemble piece PANORAMA 2 in 2011. One of Lucier’s key works, I AM SITTING IN A ROOM (1969), is introduced as a central structuring device in the film.  At home in Middletown, Connecticut, Lucier offers rare insights into the beginnings of his pioneering works, his time as a member of the Sonic Arts Union, his relations with John Cage and David Tudor, as well as his teaching practice at Wesleyan University.","popularity":0.4445,"poster_path":"/x6EShxSOFp3XlCIEqOXUjeLKPoC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2406,"logo_path":"/awYxP0L1FKUxf0oIanEDEKFKuaY.png","name":"FilmFörderung Hamburg","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":192245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viola Rusche & Hauke Harder","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Composer Alvin Lucier","title":"No Ideas But in Things - the composer Alvin Lucier","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Lucier","original_name":"Alvin Lucier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"55cb729b925141220a0020eb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496213,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Viola Rusche","original_name":"Viola Rusche","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55cb72ad92514122050021f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hauke Harder","original_name":"Hauke Harder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55cb72b792514122050021f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496214,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hauke Harder","original_name":"Hauke Harder","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55cb73109251412215001f16","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496213,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Viola Rusche","original_name":"Viola Rusche","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55cb73239251412217002137","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3898017,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Zawadzki","original_name":"Martin Zawadzki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d7a517c15b5500f0b7dba6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x6EShxSOFp3XlCIEqOXUjeLKPoC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":724}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":227302,"name":"portrait of an artist"},{"id":243710,"name":"contemporary classical music"},{"id":293118,"name":"experimental music"},{"id":312235,"name":"american experimentalism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
