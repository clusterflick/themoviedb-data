He is face to face with the viewer, his head close against the video screen, lying cozily on the floor. Acconci writes, \"The scene is a living room — quiet, private night — the scene for a come-on — I can bring my legs around, wrapping myself around the viewer — I'm playing songs on a tape recorder — I follow the songs up, I'm building a relationship, I'm carrying it through.\" Smoking cigarettes, he begins a seductive monologue as he plays \"theme songs\" by the Doors, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Kris Kristofferson and others on a tape recorder. The songs are a starting point for his come-ons; the tenor of his monologues shifts with the lyrics. \"Of course I can't see your face. I have no idea what your face looks like. You could be anybody out there, but there's gotta be somebody watching me.","popularity":0.0795,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Theme Song","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vito Acconci","original_name":"Vito Acconci","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/kF3zEReeQUwVaifuUaXNMniO1v8.jpg","credit_id":"55cb9425925141764b0002ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
