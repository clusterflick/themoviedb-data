A young girl lends her curiosity to discover what it is that holds the old painter back. Her mother tells her a bedtime story to which brings understanding of the relationship between the abandoned factory and the lonely artist nearby. Poetically representing a new relationship between human beings and things buried in oblivion after doing their duties, this work approaches the essence of 'science' and 'civilization.'","popularity":0.1688,"poster_path":"/8CtiSy8B947IZoAnOaxR9FPi3mJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A smell of blood from the old rusting iron","title":"Fe","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Ferum","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Hagane","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Iron","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1222045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eiji Maruyama","original_name":"丸山詠二","popularity":0.5638,"profile_path":"/92amqJ8ShSJiE6rT0gkDDXZyZc3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"59397d9092514108840136cc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reina Oshibe","original_name":"Reina Oshibe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"59397da6c3a368787c0128ae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fumiko Kawahara","original_name":"Fumiko Kawahara","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"59397dba925141088e013e5e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kanji Nakajima","original_name":"Kanji Nakajima","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":"/l2fZIVI4gHSuen2gwVB863ipzOR.jpg","credit_id":"54736a7cc3a368058e002084","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kanji Nakajima","original_name":"Kanji Nakajima","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":"/l2fZIVI4gHSuen2gwVB863ipzOR.jpg","credit_id":"59397dea925141089901367c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kanji Nakajima","original_name":"Kanji Nakajima","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":"/l2fZIVI4gHSuen2gwVB863ipzOR.jpg","credit_id":"59397e02c3a36878c5012c29","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kanji Nakajima","original_name":"Kanji Nakajima","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":"/l2fZIVI4gHSuen2gwVB863ipzOR.jpg","credit_id":"59397e4e92514108950134f5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kanji Nakajima","original_name":"Kanji Nakajima","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":"/l2fZIVI4gHSuen2gwVB863ipzOR.jpg","credit_id":"59397e40c3a368781901428d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kanji Nakajima","original_name":"Kanji Nakajima","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":"/l2fZIVI4gHSuen2gwVB863ipzOR.jpg","credit_id":"59397e2fc3a368785a013ca0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1830537,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kazuma Yamaoka","original_name":"Kazuma Yamaoka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59397e1ec3a368787c0128f6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1346965","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eVmKvnuKJL6GRvhUNWFEd9ZHDrG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1121,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8CtiSy8B947IZoAnOaxR9FPi3mJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":1087,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sQ2rVXwel9lrSYfTIlICdXnfxn0.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
