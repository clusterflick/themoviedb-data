The Light Fantastic (BBC, tx. 18/12/1960) was written and presented by Ron Hitchins, a Cockney barrow boy who has long been interested in a great many dance forms, and who has recently taken up Spanish dancing. Hitchins participates in some of the dance sequences, but his main contribution is an enthusiastic commentary that helps personalise what could have been simply a disparate collection of dance footage. He's not shy about expressing likes and dislikes, being none too keen on ballroom dancing (too choreographed), rock'n'roll (too monotonous) and Morris dancing (just doesn't like it), though anything genuinely spontaneous gets a thumbs up, even if it's a room full of people dressed in black swaying to the sound of a gong.","popularity":0.274,"poster_path":"/6sJLhslPRIZIHjC3B8mEvABsMxj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1960-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Light Fantastic","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Hitchins","original_name":"Ron Hitchins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Presenter","credit_id":"547146e392514112e70067e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":214001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anneke Wills","original_name":"Anneke Wills","popularity":0.1391,"profile_path":"/ySw7ahLNmvmz6nsqEsOSi7HTFu6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Girl in Flamenco Club","credit_id":"67ed5afbb9424cd895ab0754","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32327,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Russell","original_name":"Ken Russell","popularity":0.3562,"profile_path":"/hM5kaWhCsdZbl2NsHES3rWzt8xa.jpg","credit_id":"547146d192514121f400081e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0054028","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.725,"height":962,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6sJLhslPRIZIHjC3B8mEvABsMxj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":697}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":163211,"name":"modern dance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
