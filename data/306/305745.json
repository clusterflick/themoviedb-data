Meanwhile, they all keep working, expressing their thoughts and feelings by craft, gesture, art, and poetry. A film about friendship and the people we love, about the shared heritage we leave behind and the things we take with us when we go. A film about life, but also about death and how we see life through it. A film about time and how it shapes us as we are.","popularity":0.0608,"poster_path":"/9cgejUaTUsy9XXF0tYLEoLG9891.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Work of Days","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1388740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis-Pierre Bougie","original_name":"Louis-Pierre Bougie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5472bf8392514121f4003d57","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François-Xavier Marange","original_name":"François-Xavier Marange","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5472bf919251410ebc002a76","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Saint-Pierre","original_name":"Denis Saint-Pierre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5472bf969251416dc3000bee","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruno Baillargeon","original_name":"Bruno Baillargeon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5472bf69c3a36833ad00266f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4265008","wikidata_id":"Q114050944","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jmllV6ZGvZf6P9hCXFjgwnjxCbM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nbyGjD76XpjX3bCj7cGDwFwRlpC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2400},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yj5Sx5UEVGRTYk4XOC6RcJVKuC2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zMJNpykwf1oyeCHEDHvIQXHYar0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5UN6FiXEG28tnNLzsTaMiZxkZp7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2400},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tsGtI8xYeQhleG2nyRqJh3hI4kv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9cgejUaTUsy9XXF0tYLEoLG9891.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":510}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
