A small Georgia town struggles with the rationing and sacrifices of America at war. Christmas is no exception as 11-year-old Gordy and his sister Priscilla sense a fear in the train station where they await their father's homecoming. Propaganda posters and tense adult talk drive home the evil of the enemy. When a train loaded with German POWs arrives in the station, Gordy's curiosity is stronger than his fear. He dares to approach the prison train and makes contact with a young German soldier named Hans. Through the courage to trust and the song Silent Night, friends and foes learn the true meaning of Peace on Earth, Goodwill Towards Men, and hearts are forever changed. Based on true events.","popularity":0.1438,"poster_path":"/qXBS3ocbZPyZP8cq3vESjwUYtjX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Christmas Soldier","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1507474,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Jordan","original_name":"Emily Jordan","popularity":0.1381,"profile_path":"/noCRMCrNkyKZ84Xh6dbNsbsXVQm.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Cilla Walker","credit_id":"5afe04edc3a3687497000bc7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1985862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Johnson III","original_name":"Ben Johnson III","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Charlie","credit_id":"5afe051d925141789a000f5e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2034458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Owen Smith","original_name":"Owen Smith","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d5897f4a4bf60101e7d2c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4208467,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mauriel Joslyn","original_name":"Mauriel Joslyn","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d589b44a4bf60101e7d30f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4208467,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mauriel Joslyn","original_name":"Mauriel Joslyn","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d589edf14dad01004aba56","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1245614,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeff Rosen","original_name":"Jeff Rosen","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d58a0bf495ee0293539a52","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2034458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Owen Smith","original_name":"Owen Smith","popularity":0.1014,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d58a2dbf31f201ca8b194c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0826768","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qXBS3ocbZPyZP8cq3vESjwUYtjX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
