Under mother's wing, Jordi spends all his time on the Internet. His only adventure is a ride on the back of his girlfriend's motorbike. One day, a coincidental but shocking discovery on the Net forces him to start searching for his identity, away from his familiar environment. It takes him to a confrontation with his biological father who was supposed dead, but appears to live in Ireland and does not immediately press his lost son in his arms. Kilkenny Cross is a coming-of-age drama, in which the Dutch urban water landscape contrasts with the green hills of Ireland and the impassiveness of modern means of communication with the longing for human intimacy. A chat session between mother and son leads to an emotional climax. In a cameo role, female novelist Manon Uphoff explains what true love means.","popularity":0.4263,"poster_path":"/i4SYU5RjNqOULZXALgfedTvZDDt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kilkenny Cross","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sjoerd Dragtsma","original_name":"Sjoerd Dragtsma","popularity":0.2271,"profile_path":"/ke8cm2wBT8zt19bbGiH0i16KgwC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5473524ec3a3683691000410","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariëlle Woltring","original_name":"Mariëlle Woltring","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54735256c3a3683691000413","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariane Schluter","original_name":"Ariane Schluter","popularity":0.1488,"profile_path":"/oQdGo6V7yLOMfr9xl9uXo9u7PtL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"54735261c3a3683691000416","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Hensema","original_name":"Marcel Hensema","popularity":0.4335,"profile_path":"/sb00s42PGW24rlxTFUBj0JbKcMv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5473526a9251414b4b0006a8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":233928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piet Kamerman","original_name":"Piet Kamerman","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5473528ec3a3682cbe000669","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1229174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eoin McCarthy","original_name":"Eoin McCarthy","popularity":0.1431,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"547352a39251415cfc0029af","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sue Walsh","original_name":"Sue Walsh","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"547352c9c3a3683703000e3a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Birchmore","original_name":"Zoe Birchmore","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"547352d29251415cfc0029b6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cliodhna Hallissey","original_name":"Cliodhna Hallissey","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"547352da92514120b400201b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Hallissey","original_name":"Leo Hallissey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"547352e392514167c80002ca","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":103027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hedda Lornie","original_name":"Hedda Lornie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"547352ebc3a36822ba001709","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cox Habbema","original_name":"Cox Habbema","popularity":0.1646,"profile_path":"/v4EEAwrZiYrP8IgmwVrQvr9u7vx.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"547352f39251412e250010ba","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manon Uphoff","original_name":"Manon Uphoff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"547352fcc3a3687d590001e3","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Oosthoek","original_name":"Eric Oosthoek","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5473523a9251412b6d000b6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1009997,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hugo Heinen","original_name":"Hugo Heinen","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54735243c3a36845e5000621","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0461977","wikidata_id":"Q2030776","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1677,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/i4SYU5RjNqOULZXALgfedTvZDDt.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1181}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
