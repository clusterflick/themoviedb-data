There is also on-screen text, a voice critiquing it, and music from Pink Floyd, at this point still fronted by Syd Barrett--Whitehead's old painting friend from Cambridge. The track here, \"Interstellar Overdrive\", was recorded by Whitehead before the band signed to EMI and is much more exciting and beat-driven than the version they would later record for the label. There is no explicit link between the content of the film and the Cochrane Theatre, which is is named after, but the theatre was used as a venue for the Spontaneous Festival of Underground Films in 1966.","popularity":0.07,"poster_path":"/4WuFmu8t3GP08mbxsRCWLIaGsJ9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeanetta Cochrane","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":938895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nico","original_name":"Nico","popularity":0.2366,"profile_path":"/6VyjDb5du0kN0XshCn0l1nO4uRF.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"546f3b1892514112e9001a2f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1111223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Whitehead","original_name":"Peter Whitehead","popularity":0.1939,"profile_path":"/8wbAQrzkOeqF366j3bsj2BTOl0z.jpg","credit_id":"546f3b5cc3a3682fad001a67","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1111223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Whitehead","original_name":"Peter Whitehead","popularity":0.1939,"profile_path":"/8wbAQrzkOeqF366j3bsj2BTOl0z.jpg","credit_id":"546f3b3bc3a3682faa001b35","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1111223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Whitehead","original_name":"Peter Whitehead","popularity":0.1939,"profile_path":"/8wbAQrzkOeqF366j3bsj2BTOl0z.jpg","credit_id":"546f3b3192514112f3001cbe","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1111223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Whitehead","original_name":"Peter Whitehead","popularity":0.1939,"profile_path":"/8wbAQrzkOeqF366j3bsj2BTOl0z.jpg","credit_id":"546f3b2492514112e7001b7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3728104","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7lpUSOoY6pY1eVeGNYRhAYNdhQV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i7YaqvBbSWYCNwq2VLcvl24aM0f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4WuFmu8t3GP08mbxsRCWLIaGsJ9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"PETER WHITEHEAD - JEANETTA COCHRANE","key":"uCoOjAiSqq4","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2018-10-04T11:02:34.000Z","id":"6264b86b0929f600519a641b"}]}}}
