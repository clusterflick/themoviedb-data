One day the local Poojary comes across a seemingly menacing looking male, feeds him, and asks Mahua's dad to look after him. This male has no memory and they name him Kishan. Shortly thereafter Mahua and Kishan fall in love and get married. After about 2 months Kishan goes to the city and does not return home. A frantic Mahua and her dad go to the Police as well as to the city to search for him albeit in vain and return home. Mahua continues to worry about Kishan and sets out on her own to try and locate him.
