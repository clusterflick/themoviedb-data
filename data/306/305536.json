He works as a doctor in a military hospital and has always been committed to bringing about the end of war. When his wife dies in an air raid, he spends all of his time working on an anti-war invention to distract himself, and in the process neglects his new wife and his child. When the child is killed in an accident because of his machinery, he ends up pushing away his wife and best friend and focusing solely on his invention. In the end he sees the error of his ways, reconciles with his wife and friend and realizes that peace for humanity is something which comes from within.","popularity":0.2127,"poster_path":"/1MkY8UtYXqnnsJIjbBjwgfhjgiw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1920-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kämpfende Gewalten oder Welt ohne Krieg","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"World Without War","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alf Blütecher","original_name":"Alf Blütecher","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/r6tu5bnv2U4wM8bfWDBiUFjo2g7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Dr. Harry Barnay","credit_id":"551d06db9251416a210022f7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magda Rössler","original_name":"Magda Rössler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Magda","credit_id":"54712747c3a36830c4002120","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1273312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grete Reinwald","original_name":"Grete Reinwald","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/my982eouh3o2RsJmGY9G5eCFkO0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elsbeth","credit_id":"54712723c3a36867920008b3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Loni Nest","original_name":"Loni Nest","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":"/qZS3qAKfqcVADqSdq9x0kLC1isH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Klein Lisa","credit_id":"5471274192514164d1000826","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magnus Stifter","original_name":"Magnus Stifter","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/3R5IWWAdKnPb9S4GTQkUN43j9uu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ingenieur Roloff","credit_id":"5471271a9251414c9e000c92","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1388117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marian Alma","original_name":"Marian Alma","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Prof. Seebold","credit_id":"5471273392514138130021a9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1388118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Morvilius","original_name":"Karl Morvilius","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Dr. Jamusira","credit_id":"54712739c3a36830c400211b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Steinhäuser","original_name":"Georg Steinhäuser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Lord Purresbrook","credit_id":"5471274dc3a3684c6f0002e2","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156949,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fritz Bernhardt","original_name":"Fritz Bernhardt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"547126f4c3a36863750000ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29548,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Curt Courant","original_name":"Curt Courant","popularity":0.0786,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6edd6d23d27800132f5aa7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Steinhäuser","original_name":"Georg Steinhäuser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6edd76e9da69001175e659","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2403137,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"M.
