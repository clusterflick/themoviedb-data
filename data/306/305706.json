The festivities are interrupted by the arrival of an exhausted, leaderless German detachment. A few kilometers away, the inhabitants of the village of Muzière negotiate with the Germans and agree to a truce. But the arrival of a Wehrmacht captain, anxious to regain control of the men, puts an end to this fragile peace process. The captain suggested meeting the Americans and surrendering to regular troops rather than civilians. The inhabitants of Muzière, believing the truce to be broken, fire on the Germans and, on this misunderstanding, the guns start talking again.","popularity":0.3079,"poster_path":"/rHbxfuPm4u8IknUObs8ZrewuQjj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92941,"logo_path":null,"name":"AKO Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1962-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Honors of War","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Hehn","original_name":"Albert Hehn","popularity":0.2149,"profile_path":"/vJOyESK9TxbdMS4xkxTihT2sQ9v.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Captain Rollingen","credit_id":"54725bcdc3a3680659000786","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerhart Lippert","original_name":"Gerhart Lippert","popularity":0.1592,"profile_path":"/cczAXEXPJ86e2vSzakQtHktiBpt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lieutenant Bergmann","credit_id":"54725bdfc3a3681be500148c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helmut Fischer","original_name":"Helmut Fischer","popularity":0.098,"profile_path":"/qd2A1iPSzULhqchtPcN5sc7F5F4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Staff Sergeant Holbrock","credit_id":"54725bedc3a368065900078b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Verley","original_name":"Bernard Verley","popularity":0.1779,"profile_path":"/9I9T97CTBbCAQIqskDlhLuaiwIC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gérard","credit_id":"54725c1a9251413a5d002804","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Davri","original_name":"Serge Davri","popularity":0.13,"profile_path":"/y8HRuatPS0GQ2PqjikRtqCG98mu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Clovis","credit_id":"54725c8492514120b400007a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erwin Strahl","original_name":"Erwin Strahl","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/xK95jDcOxSuyUvENmZ5iAxKCV31.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sergeant Gerke","credit_id":"54725c9ac3a3681182000a92","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willy Harlander","original_name":"Willy Harlander","popularity":0.3582,"profile_path":"/k9kguSjtDPFjD7twskIwWrIVZwj.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Hermann","credit_id":"54725cd2c3a3681182000a96","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Mercey","original_name":"Paul Mercey","popularity":0.3842,"profile_path":"/uRrd4DG3ed6k4mzZvkK7uoDckWF.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Nieucourt","credit_id":"660df8ace18e3f017da34379","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3410015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Solar","original_name":"Jean Solar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Sauvage","credit_id":"660df8b39c97bd0149a38393","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Collet","original_name":"Pierre Collet","popularity":0.1669,"profile_path":"/vcSDh9EQfpWffHovUIXvbSBW9Ao.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Morizot","credit_id":"660df8c0e18e3f017da343ab","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle Godet","original_name":"Danielle Godet","popularity":0.1092,"profile_path":"/npAdPvQKb7fjvU1p5vpurELfjTZ.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Mademoiselle Lherminier","credit_id":"660df8dce039f1017ce811fe","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Elwenspoek","original_name":"Hans Elwenspoek","popularity":0.1468,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Horst Hollermann","credit_id":"660df8ea9c97bd017ca766a7","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1142152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alix Mahieux","original_name":"Alix Mahieux","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/b34n1R7m0D5F97QJDdKONPbu9EW.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Madame Clovis","credit_id":"660df8f1d400f3017d06c021","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaby Basset","original_name":"Gaby Basset","popularity":0.1466,"profile_path":"/igrn1FsziA7l6swsNAlk1HDmSx2.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Madame Sauvage","credit_id":"660df8fe15dea0017c36c9bd","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4632883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans H.
