This release features Mayall in a hard-driving, sharp set of original and classic numbers captured live on tour in 1988. This concert serves to remind us of the genius with which this pioneering artist almost single-handedly revived the Blues, and how he has made them his own over a phenomenal career in music. Featuring the paired lead guitars of Walter Trout and Coco Montoya, the band rocks hard in a tight groove that enables searing solos from the featured guitarists as well as from Mayall himself on guitar and keyboards. The guttural power of Mayall's vocals is ever-present. And the songs - most of them Mayall originals - include the classic Room To Move, with which John Mayall once electrified the world of Rock 'n' Roll.","popularity":0.5689,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1988-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ohne Filter Extra","title":"John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers - Live In Germany","video":true,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1388071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Trout","original_name":"Walter Trout","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wxkLwxQWXr8aDbsMyED2BzKFlZk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Guitar","credit_id":"547114c592514123e300086e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coco Montoya","original_name":"Coco Montoya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Guitar","credit_id":"547114dcc3a3684c6f0000f7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Mayall","original_name":"John Mayall","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/66WFsLdk9tyNKyaMAFUQ5jwx1Qo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Vocals, Guitar & Keyboards","credit_id":"547114f1c3a36830c4001f15","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":162066,"name":"rock concert"},{"id":196067,"name":"blues rock"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
