However, he takes it easy, recognizes that they're highly trained works, and teaches them a number of (flashback) stories of pioneers of the present steam train: the early invention by Denis Papin (1679); the three legendary land-surveyors of Caton Hill; the 1769 experiment by Nicolas-Joseph De Cugnot; the 1813 machine test of William Hedley; the 1829 developments by Robert Stephenson; and finally the grand opening of the first German steam railway line of Nürnberg-Fürth - stories in which man's will to conquer the machine was sometimes met with disaster.","popularity":0.1466,"poster_path":"/kbZ6eMXKfJ81huVvJbDqRMrGJLd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90908,"logo_path":null,"name":"Willy Zielke, Kultutfilmhersteller","origin_country":""},{"id":90909,"logo_path":"/xq4SGkJROQ9332emZHqxxnFH2Fc.png","name":"Reichsbahn-Filmstelle","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1935-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Steel Animal","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"L'Animal d'acier","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Steel Animal","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aribert Mog","original_name":"Aribert Mog","popularity":0.1637,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator / Engineer Klaassen","credit_id":"592bef79c3a36877fd063ed9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophia Hagen","original_name":"Sophia Hagen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Various roles","credit_id":"592bef8a9251413b410719c1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Schreck","original_name":"Max Schreck","popularity":0.3607,"profile_path":"/uKVNFFt6VA8R7pp7HIPJF4e5PfX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6487ad88e272600147bb18e9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2894169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Schrumpf","original_name":"Ernst Schrumpf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6487ad97bf31f250569cd1a4","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willy Zielke","original_name":"Willy Zielke","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":"/cqqkfNm0Ns9vByRPBfoRDpc5uSa.jpg","credit_id":"555c054a9251416b5d00056c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willy Zielke","original_name":"Willy Zielke","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":"/cqqkfNm0Ns9vByRPBfoRDpc5uSa.jpg","credit_id":"5d711754c5ada5001091714d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0121767","wikidata_id":"Q1170463","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kbZ6eMXKfJ81huVvJbDqRMrGJLd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
