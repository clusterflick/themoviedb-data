It was called \"The Red Hour Festival.\" A huge success with the fans of the original TV series (1966-69), the smash event led to much larger conventions in San Francisco, Oakland and Los Angeles. These \"Space-Con\" conventions left an indelible mark on the science-fiction fans and \"Trekkers\" who attended. In the end, conventions like Space-Con helped awaken Paramount from hibernation and led to the creation of the first installment of the major motion picture series \"Star Trek\" in 1979. This full-length documentary film is the story of how fandom revolutionized an industry.","popularity":0.3399,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":39079,"logo_path":null,"name":"November Fire Recordings","origin_country":""},{"id":39080,"logo_path":"/mkeXxqeQlIzusCg38GAHFbj3v1u.png","name":"Garfield Lane Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back to Space-Con","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1275696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Wyrsch","original_name":"Tom Wyrsch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546ff442c3a36855c7000438","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1275696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Wyrsch","original_name":"Tom Wyrsch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546ff45392514112f3003bad","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1821337","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1740,"name":"pop culture"},{"id":9818,"name":"fan culture"},{"id":161176,"name":"space opera"},{"id":208663,"name":"fan convention"},{"id":220266,"name":"fandom"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
