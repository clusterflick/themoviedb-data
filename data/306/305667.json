A narrator tells the story of the saint, of St Clare and of the orders by them founded. The images then create a sort of stroll in front of the art of Giotto and Cimabue. A procession of monks with the candles are the only human elements that stand out in the representation of the city and its architecture.","popularity":0.058,"poster_path":"/6FuW8fPBqdhy21y77xGp5u0jHFq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1932-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Assisi By Blasetti","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228338,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandro Blasetti","original_name":"Alessandro Blasetti","popularity":0.1578,"profile_path":"/kCfrlaYan7qJfYg4PPNZeAxtXs4.jpg","credit_id":"54723a7bc3a36806590003eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12324866","wikidata_id":"Q3625644","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6FuW8fPBqdhy21y77xGp5u0jHFq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1932-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
