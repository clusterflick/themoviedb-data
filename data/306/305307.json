However, his dreams always seem to be just out of reach. Fresh out of college, with no real solid job, Doug moves to Hollywood to give acting a try. This hilarious film shows just how frustrating \"making it\" can be. What the film does not show you is, it's damn near impossible. Years of countless auditions and dead end jobs, not to mention meeting / losing the love of his life, Doug has just about given up when he has one last idea. With nothing to lose he decides to roll the dice. The only question is, will it work? - Written by: Douglas Rouillard - Produced by: DR Productions www.anythingspossiblethemovie.com www.drproductions.org","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anything's Possible","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3375544","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
