Subjects in the film range from a young woman hoping to start a family, to a mother taking care of her symptomatic 6 year-old son and ailing husband; the drummer of a major country music band, a former NBC News journalist turned HD-advocate, as well as a renowned scientist relentlessly searching for a cure. Far from giving us a hopeless glimpse into life with terminal illness, Alive &amp; Well reminds us all of our ability to persevere with strength, despite life's most difficult challenges.","popularity":0.0712,"poster_path":"/9NvbnwRa9BVO25gBVm7HWZo1wcz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alive & Well","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2326270","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9NvbnwRa9BVO25gBVm7HWZo1wcz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
