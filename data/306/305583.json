By accident she catches Mr. Rumplemeyer's trousers in the donut machine as he's leaving to pick his niece who's arriving from the old country, so he gives Patsy cab fare and sends her. She forgets her purse, so when she arrives at the immigration office, she can't pay the cabbie, who tells her he'll wait while the meter runs. Inside, Patsy finally finds the high-spirited Lyda, but by then, Patsy has sneaked into the holding area and may need a passport to get out. She hides in Lyda's trunk, but with the cabbie, a suspicious immigration officer, and a traffic cop buzzing around will uncle and niece ever connect?","popularity":0.6546,"poster_path":"/g8sTxBVgtAngL3rwCJdsqjJEhQR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At Sea Ashore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patsy Kelly","original_name":"Patsy Kelly","popularity":0.3081,"profile_path":"/sef7GYVzHFNUYz9E6SoR7A2Ygc6.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Patsy Kelly","credit_id":"547175219251413813002e06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":742536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyda Roberti","original_name":"Lyda Roberti","popularity":0.1523,"profile_path":"/jYdpS9mT7KC3b5yPcDYFQwOED6s.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lyda Roberti","credit_id":"54717531c3a36830c4002dcb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1027241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Shean","original_name":"Al Shean","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/oNxgGzjvtnEOX3bVYeYWASxTaGe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Adolph Rumplemeyer","credit_id":"54717542c3a3686375000cd2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Emmett O'Connor","original_name":"Robert Emmett O'Connor","popularity":0.0895,"profile_path":"/udAKCPDJt2yQ7gdqdhZLvA73BSl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"First Immigration Officer","credit_id":"54717556c3a3681286000eed","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1277502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Twerp","original_name":"Joe Twerp","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Second Immigration Officer","credit_id":"5471756792514123e300167f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Bowen","original_name":"Harry Bowen","popularity":0.0744,"profile_path":"/zKALgIQV6JTdRCkFEkGR42f3HkY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Cab Driver (uncredited)","credit_id":"5471758ac3a3681286000efa","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Brookins","original_name":"Don Brookins","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Member of The Avalon Four (uncredited)","credit_id":"5471759b92514112ee0065f3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Art Green","original_name":"Art Green","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Member of The Avalon Four (uncredited)","credit_id":"547175d6c3a36830c4002deb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Kelsey","original_name":"Fred Kelsey","popularity":0.1849,"profile_path":"/cNLIBwSJZJzE2k4XfYdwPXdsds0.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Cop (uncredited)","credit_id":"547175f5c3a3681286000f0f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Trask","original_name":"Walter Trask","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Member of The Avalon Four (uncredited)","credit_id":"5471761992514123e30016a9","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chill Wills","original_name":"Chill Wills","popularity":0.3949,"profile_path":"/uk1BljEiYkzSd7ihp7SJIpBVI3u.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Leader of The Avalon Four (uncredited)","credit_id":"5471762992514123e30016b0","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonard Kibrick","original_name":"Leonard Kibrick","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Kid at Boat Dock (uncredited)","credit_id":"575ca74ec3a3683168000e16","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89739,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"William H.
