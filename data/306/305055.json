An eerily prescient, biting social satire, JR tells the story of a precocious 11 year-old capitalist who, with the unwitting help of his school’s resident composer, inadvertently creates the single greatest virtual empire the world has seen, spun largely from the anonymity of the school’s pay phone. F for Fibonacci develops a particular episode from JR, in which a televised music lesson is scrambled with a maths class on derivatives inside the mind of its child protagonist. Musings on aleatory music become muddled with virtual stock pickings and a theory of ‘market noise’. Unfolding through the modular machine aesthetics of the video game Minecraft, text book geometries, graphic scores, images from physics experiments, and cartoon dreams, blend with images from wall street: stock market crashes, trading pits, algorithms and transparent glass.","popularity":0.104,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"F for Fibonacci","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clay Barnard Chodzko","original_name":"Clay Barnard Chodzko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"546e88b1c3a3682f98000443","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beatrice Gibson","original_name":"Beatrice Gibson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546e882dc3a3682f9800042d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beatrice Gibson","original_name":"Beatrice Gibson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546e8817c3a3682fa400047c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beatrice Gibson","original_name":"Beatrice Gibson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546e8825c3a3682fa7000465","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":95910,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nick Gordon Smith","original_name":"Nick Gordon Smith","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546e885f92514112e7000455","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4193174","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
