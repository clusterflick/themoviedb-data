The story of a duel between two chess giants, fighting a personal war in a world gone to ruin. This battle of black and white was more than a face-off over a chessboard. Part psychological drama, part political thriller, the film brings to life their hostilities, nested like Russian dolls. Karpov vs. Kasparov represents the battle between the faltering empire and the young liberals several steps ahead of the game, checkmating the old guard. Or how two stories – the societal one and the personal one – started out separately and ended up superimposed, twining together into one tale.","popularity":0.2117,"poster_path":"/hGxCiirPl9y4sHbHJd6TSkcelQS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48098,"logo_path":"/fWIaTm5r2j6WHgatBFLn1ioZxSB.png","name":"Roche Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karpov Kasparov - Two Kings for a Crown","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anatoli Karpov","original_name":"Анатолий Карпов","popularity":0.1536,"profile_path":"/fIvsfOBFN54OvaSsOhSPR0OriSY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f9d769539a45d00351ef452","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garry Kasparov","original_name":"Garry Kasparov","popularity":0.381,"profile_path":"/vOE9BQVsU6kYQjK2zRdexDNLZBH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f9d77e3028f140032d02265","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234578,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Charles Deniau","original_name":"Jean-Charles Deniau","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9d7636a24232003463afc5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177690,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Serguei Kostine","original_name":"Serguei Kostine","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f9d7672bd990c003946ddec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hGxCiirPl9y4sHbHJd6TSkcelQS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
