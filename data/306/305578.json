King Jordan, Judi Chamberlin and Judith Heumann, and with legislators who helped draft and secure the passage of the ADA, including Tony Coelho and Tom Harkin. From the beginnings of the disability rights movement, when veterans with disabilities returning home from World War II began to demand an end to discrimination and for better access to employment and other social opportunities, Lives Worth Living traces the history of the movement in the United States in roughly chronological order. The film documents how, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, activists with disabilities began to adopt the some of the tactics and strategies used by civil rights activists a decade earlier, including marches, protests, and civil disobedience.","popularity":0.1378,"poster_path":"/i4pCTFLIWMxRdaeLyNVgNQjBfg4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lives Worth Living","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Neudel","original_name":"Eric Neudel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"547163f492514121f4000d11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1388249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Neudel","original_name":"Eric Neudel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee16c2090dde00021a8dd89","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230274,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Kusiak","original_name":"John Kusiak","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ee16c0cf031740022de4383","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541756,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"P.
