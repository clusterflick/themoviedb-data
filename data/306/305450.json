The protesters are united in the critique of representative democracy and global financial capitalism under the slogan ‘nobody represents us’. Their organisation is based on the principles of direct democracy.  In absence of other social alternatives, a community starts to emerge in the camp in front of the stock market where everyone has an equal say, and everyone is united in their diversity. After the initial euphoria the great idea of direct democracy clashes against the contemporary individual; antagonisms surface, similar to those of the system which the protesters fight against. The story about the Slovenian version of the ‘occupy’ movement is portrayed with the stories of a few protagonists, who despite several defeats do not lose hope in a different world.","popularity":0.3088,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":83638,"logo_path":"/2k1J7ndWmahXXgp3Ln6wZu91iW.png","name":"Tramal Films","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2014-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Story Of The 99%","title":"A Fight for","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Siniša Gačić","original_name":"Siniša Gačić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5470a1bbc3a3682fad004b3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Siniša Gačić","original_name":"Siniša Gačić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6380e6062e069702a802f6cb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4212378","wikidata_id":"Q26236370","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1775,"name":"demonstration"},{"id":2339,"name":"political activism"},{"id":4108,"name":"protest"},{"id":5636,"name":"wall street"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
