Mild-mannered sandwich maker Mahoma López has never been interested in politics, but in Jan. 2012, he convinces a small group of his co-workers to fight back. Risking deportation and the loss of livelihood, the workers team up with a diverse crew of innovative young organizers and take the unusual step of forming an independent union, launching themselves on a journey that will test the limits of their resolve. In one rollercoaster year, they must overcome a shocking betrayal and a two month lockout. Lawyers will battle in backroom negotiations, Occupy Wall Street protesters will take over the restaurant, and a picket line will divide the neighborhood. If they can win a contract, it will set a historic precedent for low-wage workers across the country. But whatever happens, Mahoma and his compañeros won't be exploited again.","popularity":0.6625,"poster_path":"/pOfS2gnwIDFezxsOcp2MxZdElQ5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes you have to make your own justice.","title":"The Hand That Feeds","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387580,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robin Blotnick","original_name":"Robin Blotnick","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546f5a89c3a3682fa40020b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Rivera","original_name":"Alex Rivera","popularity":0.1058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546f5ad292514170660000a9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Borenstein","original_name":"David Borenstein","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546f5ac4c3a3682f98001e8f","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387583,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ryan Blotnick","original_name":"Ryan Blotnick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546f5ae992514112f30022c0","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1387581,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patricia Benabe","original_name":"Patricia Benabe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546f5aae92514112e70026af","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1387584,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rachel Lears","original_name":"Rachel Lears","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/l1ogCR49F9RctE0dbtsYKb8uJsG.jpg","credit_id":"546f5af6c3a3682fad001ece","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387580,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robin Blotnick","original_name":"Robin Blotnick","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546f5b00c3a3682fa1002e61","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1387584,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rachel Lears","original_name":"Rachel Lears","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/l1ogCR49F9RctE0dbtsYKb8uJsG.jpg","credit_id":"554d39059251413faa002a0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2812712","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pOfS2gnwIDFezxsOcp2MxZdElQ5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":33585,"name":"labor"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
