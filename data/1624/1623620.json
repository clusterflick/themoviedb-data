The work, co-produced by Spaccanapoli Online and Dropper Lab, with executive production by the VisionArea collective, stands out for its great ambition: it is provocative, but in a sincere and delicate way, chosen by the young Neapolitan director to approach a topic that is painfully subject to discrimination and ridicule from the public.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Napoli in Trans","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
