Cloaked in weighted fabric, the figures operate within what Deleuze might call a folded temporality, collapsing past and present into a shared plane of urgency, interrogating the structures of monumentality and remembrance. In her essay A Threatening Presence, writer Georgia Phillips-Amos argues “rather than commemorate or memorialize lives past, Galindo’s Aparición follows Judith Butler’s definition of spectre as ‘foreclosed and yet surviving’. Their time is ours, and vice-versa”. Galindo’s work thus establishes a presence in place. Returning again to Barnett, “Yet within the hollow of the fold, and despite its closure, a leap may still be possible: not a leap elsewhere…but rather leaping in place…and thus distorting or displacing the ground (the foundation, or its unfounding)”.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apparition","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3954550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Regina José Galindo","original_name":"Regina José Galindo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6977b551b88d5d1ee1eafb30","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3954550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Regina José Galindo","original_name":"Regina José Galindo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6977b570c9dd574a6ba378ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
