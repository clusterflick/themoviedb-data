But his survival instincts are put to the ultimate test when he and four other grunts are given a deadly mission: venture into the perilous No Man’s Land to euthanize a wounded comrade. What they find amid the ruined battlefield, however, is not a man in need of mercy but a fallen angel, seemingly struck down by artillery fire. This celestial being may hold the key to ending the brutal conflict, but only if the soldiers can suppress their individual desires and work together. As jealousy, greed, and paranoia take hold, the group is torn apart by their inner demons, threatening to turn their angelic encounter into a descent into hell.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Angel Down","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1050132,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniel Kraus","original_name":"Daniel Kraus","popularity":0.784,"profile_path":"/puDtVAss5qprwxt9byt2gTTQ3bL.jpg","credit_id":"6977b64e245dffe8bc1a1808","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":339,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Grazer","original_name":"Brian Grazer","popularity":0.6965,"profile_path":"/rNFUflKlpTEbnWDHd2Of293E4lx.jpg","credit_id":"6977b738df1517020aeafaf4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5964235,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Valerie Novotny","original_name":"Valerie Novotny","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6977b76aa97f552df8eafbe7","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1673675,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Allan Mandelbaum","original_name":"Allan Mandelbaum","popularity":0.2974,"profile_path":"/iGTtEctZQY83NfDnVz03dGfitJh.jpg","credit_id":"6977b77a573ef9340b106cc9","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":931,"name":"jealousy"},{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"},{"id":2340,"name":"paranoia"},{"id":5332,"name":"greed"},{"id":10141,"name":"battlefield"},{"id":13065,"name":"soldier"},{"id":33652,"name":"private"},{"id":250702,"name":"no man's land"},{"id":253417,"name":"inner demons"},{"id":348057,"name":"wwi"},{"id":353736,"name":"survival instinct"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
