A subtle and unusual tale of femme/butch love. It is a road movie of the body - 'the wrong way down a one way street'. The style is experimental though it is primarily a fiction - a journey within an interior space - a view of America by a travelling femme and her obsession with a genderbending butch. Is it only one woman's journey? The multiple voice over implies that it is a symbol for all strange journeys through place and time - across the border of desire and beyond.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liquor, Guns n' Ammo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5964894,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Karpinski","original_name":"Barbara Karpinski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697801278cfdc03f670894dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1072339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Karpinski","original_name":"Barbara Karpinski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6978013fe15052be43a3798c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1072339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Karpinski","original_name":"Barbara Karpinski","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6978014c7250d9fd6f6953ca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
