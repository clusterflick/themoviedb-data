The film highlights the deadliest, most aggressive, forgotten form of breast cancer—one that has no early detection, does not show on a mammogram, and most often presents as a rash. Sherry, a retired school principal from Jackson, Mississippi, prayed for her next platform to help others. That stage, however, became Stage 4 inflammatory breast cancer. Where inspiration meets information, Sherry teaches others how to “Have a Flamingo Day” – demonstrating the power of perspective, choice, and purposeful impact in the face of life’s adversity.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/c71muAWBFA0E8QUS2sPe2N3fYbQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inflammingo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c71muAWBFA0E8QUS2sPe2N3fYbQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":541}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
