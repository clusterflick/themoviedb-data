However, the reunion quickly becomes uncomfortable. Old wounds, unresolved conflicts, and buried secrets begin to surface, turning the experience into an increasingly tense and claustrophobic one. Isolated in a house far from the city, the women are forced to confront the past and face the emotional consequences of deep trauma. Mary Jane’s instability becomes progressively more apparent: her silence, restrained gestures, and the way she observes the others reveal a mind shaped by trauma, guilt, and obsession. Trapped between memories that refuse to fade and a desperate need for control, Mary Jane begins to confuse protection with punishment, love with violence. The film offers a disturbing portrait of the psychological deterioration of a woman pushed to her limits, where sanity dissolves and nothing is exactly as it seems.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/kQ0UrlUJzGu62wrLtGsxckyoya5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some things are meant to be seen.
