It was Paik’s own way of summarizing his artistic career with video. The film installation consists of fast-paced and overlapping images that completely cover the gallery walls and ceiling—one of the most under-appreciated parts of architecture, according to Paik. With its electronic visuals and booming audio, interspersed with periods of silence, the immersive installation stands in stark contrast to the experience of its namesake.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/eInya8NK8SVNQsyAkiUWA9HuuAH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":287346,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eidotech","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1993-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sistine Chapel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2301978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shigeko Kubota","original_name":"久保田 成子","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6977828a4ecc6372e1a37658","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1380448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Moorman","original_name":"Charlotte Moorman","popularity":0.7418,"profile_path":"/m204NJpTSr4WVw5NRvDz56HTiHb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self / Performer","credit_id":"697782a8bcdceb9392a37608","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merce Cunningham","original_name":"Merce Cunningham","popularity":0.2336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"697782b6a338b374341a1395","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cage","original_name":"John Cage","popularity":0.2535,"profile_path":"/9gmtnfJV6dO81hNzxr2Nm3UGeNv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"697782c54837467d6c1069b2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Beuys","original_name":"Joseph Beuys","popularity":0.4066,"profile_path":"/bUJtO121gwsfiP5aMya77I6biOb.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self / Performer","credit_id":"69778302b4b50446d4b68530","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nam June Paik","original_name":"Nam June Paik","popularity":0.1517,"profile_path":"/102ydoj5whqw0yABb30lPGl0f3U.jpg","credit_id":"69777dfe860fce5007106e9a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nam June Paik","original_name":"Nam June Paik","popularity":0.1517,"profile_path":"/102ydoj5whqw0yABb30lPGl0f3U.jpg","credit_id":"69777e0718d863818ceafba8","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nam June Paik","original_name":"Nam June Paik","popularity":0.1517,"profile_path":"/102ydoj5whqw0yABb30lPGl0f3U.jpg","credit_id":"69777e3b4f6b1541986951d5","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nam June Paik","original_name":"Nam June Paik","popularity":0.1517,"profile_path":"/102ydoj5whqw0yABb30lPGl0f3U.jpg","credit_id":"69778359a338b374341a13a6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5963832,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jungsung Lee","original_name":"Jungsung Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"697783ce9b7f5906f80893a9","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Advisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eInya8NK8SVNQsyAkiUWA9HuuAH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":244417,"name":"art installation"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"},{"id":305843,"name":"art film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"\"The Future is Now\" exhibition at Tate Modern, London -
