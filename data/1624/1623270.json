The page was satire, but police took it VERY seriously. They raided Anthony's home, jailed him for four days, and charged him with a felony punishable by 18 months in prison—all for a joke. His ensuing legal battle, which reached the U.S. Supreme Court, underscored the importance of free speech and police accountability. But just 15 miles from Anthony’s arrest, another police encounter revealed the most devastating consequence when constitutional protections break down—ending not in jail, but in a man's death.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/8Ma7z1bbC10jqhcb9jqNAxnmSjd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crime & Parody","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Ma7z1bbC10jqhcb9jqNAxnmSjd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
