Filmed as a document of the insect's life cycle, the intertitles drive home the connection between flies and the spread of disease. Flies feed from a sore on a dog’s back and then crawl on a bottle teat from which a baby will be fed. Hours and miles may have separated the filming, but the two images remain together in your mind - hopefully encouraging better public health.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8AF0rImP90lmOunw52mWLh9dh0W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":287436,"logo_path":null,"name":"Will Day Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1915-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swat That Fly!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8AF0rImP90lmOunw52mWLh9dh0W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1915-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
