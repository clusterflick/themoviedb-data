Now, 9.5mm has become a mythical format that most people are unfamiliar with. This is not surprising, as its heyday was over 80 years ago. For a while, the only information available about the author, who was born after the war, was in books. However, because there is a feed hole in the center of the film, the screen size is almost 16 mm. This unique structure is a major attraction.  Hand crank equipment was also used at the 9.5mm One-man Film Festival 2019. A motor that squeaks and groans due to lack of oil, or that stops and starts, A lamp that goes on and off due to poor contact, etc. It was a tense screening.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9,5mm & I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Me and the 9.5mm","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575125,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jun'ichi Okuyama","original_name":"Jun'ichi Okuyama","popularity":0.1178,"profile_path":"/lbsPehXqanx4OiXNU3YKhVd417C.jpg","credit_id":"697908cf38040f9151787a8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
