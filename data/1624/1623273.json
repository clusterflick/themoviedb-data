Two chefs appear—one recognized by the Emperor of Japan, the other by the President of Taiwan—suggested through the contrast of white and black. But this is not a hymn to Michelin glory.  It is simply a confession.\r From people who leave their hometowns carrying three blades: scissors, a razor, and a kitchen knife. From people who become more fluent in the local language than in their mother tongue. From people who think most about family, friends, and the person sitting across the table—not about nations, not about ethnic or national pride.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/e3eCHKsJzgB2rldDyshLhpPZoiV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Table of the Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e3eCHKsJzgB2rldDyshLhpPZoiV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
