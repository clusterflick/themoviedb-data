Blige Presents Be Happy","overview":"Mary J. Blige Presents Be Happy follows 50-year-old Val (Tisha Campbell), a devoted wife and stay at home mom, who is eager to reignite the spark in her marriage when her youngest child leaves for college. Grappling with empty-nest feelings, loneliness and growing emotional distance from her husband Ross (Russell Hornsby), Val begins to realize that her marriage and the woman she once was, may be slipping away. A spontaneous escape to New Orleans to support her pregnant daughter, Kayla (Zing Ashford), awakens long-buried dreams and passions and introduces her to Peter Mosley (Mekhi Phifer), a handsome and charismatic photographer who sees her in ways she has forgotten to see herself. Reawakening her artistic spirit and rediscovering her worth, Val must face a life-altering question: is it ever too late to choose yourself and the love you truly deserve?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sL7CZWSQLC5fHzGGLDKqWAVmLUy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mary J.
