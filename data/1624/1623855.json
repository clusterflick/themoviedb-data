They’re competing for admission to New York City’s Specialized High Schools, elite public institutions that have produced Nobel Prize laureates, astronauts, judges, artists, and national leaders. But as the kids await their test results, a citywide battle is raging over who should attend these schools—the kids who score highest on the entrance exam or the kids who improve diversity. Featuring interviews with kids, parents, and education leaders, If You Can Make It Here places young students at the center of a high-stakes cultural conflict over the future of equity and excellence in public education.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fWp1Jq4yqRiWX8BjcPxNxU6VIhx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":287437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pacific Legal
