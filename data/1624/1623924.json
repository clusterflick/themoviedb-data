The Cage Within follows Jake, a young fighter struggling with anger, trauma and the weight of expectations, as he tries to break the cycle of violence that shaped him. Between training, silence and fractured relationships, the film observes a man who chooses not to become what hurt him — even when that choice hurts more.  An intimate, restrained drama about masculinity, control and the quiet cost of change.","popularity":0.4,"poster_path":"/kcyb7oY7ibRWIK1DJPxKTT5ejnv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"The real fight isn’t in the ring, but inside the mind.","title":"THE CAGE WITHIN","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Marcos","original_name":"Ivan Marcos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jake Moreira","credit_id":"69791cb40f0412f5ce51b134","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murillo Silva","original_name":"Murillo Silva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Marco","credit_id":"69791cc02991ef474f99b4fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heitor","original_name":"Heitor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tony Martinez","credit_id":"69791ce71d81357051ae3210","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lourenzo","original_name":"Lourenzo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Josh","credit_id":"69791d0433e988b8b26a19a2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Martins","original_name":"Martin Martins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Reporter","credit_id":"69791d213419b20f3a6b06e0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5966837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Carmo","original_name":"Nicolas Carmo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69791d48676b5528766a193b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5966837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Carmo","original_name":"Nicolas Carmo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69791d9cf8458e5ae399b4e9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5966837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Carmo","original_name":"Nicolas Carmo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69791db53fa7015bb499b527","department":"Lighting","job":"Directing Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5966837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Carmo","original_name":"Nicolas Carmo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69791dce94b971ac8118e8b0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5966837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Carmo","original_name":"Nicolas Carmo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69791de32e6aad29b8afea7c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966844,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marcelo Souza","original_name":"Marcelo Souza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69791e025d468907bae6af73","department":"Production","job":"Production Executive"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966845,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Guilherme Dias","original_name":"Guilherme Dias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69791e1e63ceb53e9618e8d8","department":"Art","job":"Assistant Art Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966846,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tiago Sampe","original_name":"Tiago Sampe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69791e488114900bf8e6af91","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966847,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Yara Frazão","original_name":"Yara Frazão","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69791e77cd4f4417c46a195b","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5966845,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Guilherme Dias","original_name":"Guilherme Dias","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69791e9c81d82d8d736b06e6","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1508,"iso_3166_1":"PT","iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/kcyb7oY7ibRWIK1DJPxKTT5ejnv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1131}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"M/14","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2026-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
