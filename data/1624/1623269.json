Through the lives of Surendra, a Dalit reporter with a near-invisible YouTube channel; Imran, an idealistic auto driver; and the town’s young army aspirants, the film uncovers stories of disenchantment, resilience, and hope. Against a backdrop of rallies, a defunct sugar mill, and a carnival-like mela, the film reveals a democracy both vibrant and broken. As rain floods polling day, 'Gola Dreams' becomes a lyrical meditation on aspiration, marginalisation, and the fragile promises of India’s electoral theatre.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jEccX8laS8ZbeI99M6PpsHqYHS1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gola Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1943522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pankaj Rishi Kumar","original_name":"Pankaj Rishi Kumar","popularity":0.1551,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6977ae38e15052be43a37656","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1650,"iso_3166_1":"IN","iso_639_1":"hi","file_path":"/jEccX8laS8ZbeI99M6PpsHqYHS1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1170}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
