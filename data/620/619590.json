It is sometimes minimal (the editing), sometimes extensive, always sensitive. I did not change it, as when I did the entire re-edit of Cornell's Legend for Fountains. JACK'S DREAM, for instance, is a puppet animation into which Cornell has inserted a few shots from other material - just enough to throw it into the sphere of artful fantasy. Whereas CARROUSEL is a fully edited animal piece. There is no way now of determining the order in which the films were made, or even the exact years, but it was some time in the '40s.\" -Larry Jordan in 2003","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/4oTAVqLOHzVd0x032RCVInkFBBG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three More by Cornell","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Cornell","original_name":"Joseph Cornell","popularity":0.1209,"profile_path":"/3JxMVOtAbN01e1ACnbGYLGPM0PL.jpg","credit_id":"607504547776f0003f5e550b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4oTAVqLOHzVd0x032RCVInkFBBG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Academic Film of North America entry","release_date":"2003-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
