After sharing a short story about how he met Guy Clark while hitchhiking around Texas, the band performed the ode to the Hill Country honky-tonkin’ queen “Rita Ballou,” featuring Eleanor Whitmore on violin. Following a tale about Clark’s loyalty to Texas BBQ over Tennessee style BBQ, Joe Ely joined Earle on stage to perform “Desperadoes Waiting For a Train” – two Texas music legends trading verses on one of the state’s most influential songs.","popularity":0.4312,"poster_path":"/roqw3DPcA2pw9X1e7SMgofWKnRX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36238,"logo_path":null,"name":"KLRU Austin","origin_country":""},{"id":94654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Austin City Limits","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ode to Guy Clark: Steve Earle in Austin, TX","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":203696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Earle","original_name":"Steve Earle","popularity":0.2101,"profile_path":"/wjhJ5GiZkGwlxx8DoMzHf3kqOEw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d3e79ffb87aec00113a697c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1242710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Ely","original_name":"Joe Ely","popularity":0.0619,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d3e7a4834e15238fce7718d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1056235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodney Crowell","original_name":"Rodney Crowell","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":"/4MQESspJw8U8Ah7EW34WkhNkUDc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5d3e7a5534e1525dace782cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jo Harvey Allen","original_name":"Jo Harvey Allen","popularity":0.1735,"profile_path":"/76jMNv4JR13K3bZxGhrB0q1Q2lG.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d3e7acab87aec00113a6abb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2373553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Allen","original_name":"Terry Allen","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/1fJvy2FCDZUo2R97dxXrMTju5Qi.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5d3e7aec34e1525dace783b3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Masterson","original_name":"Chris Masterson","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d3e7a0e21621b1101edd53d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleanor Whitmore","original_name":"Eleanor Whitmore","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d3e7a8d34e1525dace78300","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricky Ray Jackson","original_name":"Ricky Ray Jackson","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d3e7a7621621b4d6bf1782f","order":7}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/roqw3DPcA2pw9X1e7SMgofWKnRX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":18002,"name":"hard rock"},{"id":161188,"name":"austin, texas"},{"id":237717,"name":"alternative country"},{"id":244962,"name":"outlaw country music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
