Behind the Screens explores this trend toward \"hypercommercialism\" through phenomena such as product placement, tie-ins, merchandising and cross-promotions. It combines multiple examples taken directly from the movies with incisive interviews provided by film scholars, cultural critics, political economists, and an Oscar-nominated screenwriter.  Behind the Screens presents an accessible argument designed for school and college-age audiences-- precisely the demographic most prized by both Hollywood studios and advertisers alike. It features examples drawn from movies such as Wayne's World, Forrest Gump, The Lion King, Summer of Sam, and Toy Story.","popularity":0.5026,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":27072,"logo_path":"/6kSyzXASYqFyD7HVPg32rTsprjd.png","name":"Media Education Foundation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hollywood Goes Hypercommercial","title":"Behind the Screens, Hollywood Goes Hypercommercial","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58028,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeremy Pikser","original_name":"Jeremy Pikser","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/4MdVQ2g8wrRLFZK3ldUSMAwiSwk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5d412b4b34e1521fb8eb24f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":549977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Crispin Miller","original_name":"Mark Crispin Miller","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/3vqbxXwJ1a9L9t914UkKDrDdvuI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5d412b7334e1525daced8be7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1071883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert McChesney","original_name":"Robert McChesney","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5d412bd7b87aec4bdd39249d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan J.
