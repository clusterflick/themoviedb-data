Without human presence, the land is roamed by wildlife like civets, macaques and wild boars. A project is underway to study the deserted areas by attaching a camera to wild boars to record the conditions of the former farmlands. Years after the disaster, we take a close look at how radiation has affected the wildlife, and what it entails for us humans.","popularity":0.0412,"poster_path":"/pF2OBb8EuvwjSQ4SLDIYZoPkQj8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Radioactive Forest","video":true,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6669576","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wFFTIQSFQfrupCjWJBQtKnODEbP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1916}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pF2OBb8EuvwjSQ4SLDIYZoPkQj8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/PDgcximyjys2OXkYymKRkjQH95.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
