They prefer to keep the inhabitants illiterate, so that they can continue to oppress and abuse them over time. But one young lad, Ramu, educates himself secretly with the help of the local school-master, Srikanth. Years later, Ramu has grown up and is now a formidable force to reckon with. Madhukar and Jaggu see him as a threat and soon spin a web of lies and deceit around him, leaving him with no alternative except to retreat, leaving the poor villagers once again at their mercy of their oppressors.","popularity":0.2541,"poster_path":"/paEqKKFbkeKx81ATa3ogxGou8ip.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1984-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Naya Kadam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajesh Khanna","original_name":"Rajesh Khanna","popularity":0.4885,"profile_path":"/e32HlV5NRNKeEh654OKgMQJfU2r.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e75836b2f3b1700174f1b2d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":980737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Padmini Kolhapure","original_name":"Padmini Kolhapure","popularity":0.3218,"profile_path":"/fdJIZTzEKSfEigLugsZBWHK3SSm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e758377a055ef00162b52c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sridevi","original_name":"Sridevi","popularity":1.055,"profile_path":"/lQHnDO0PU0p3d1nKDvjkdk60J97.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e75837fcabfe400132084d0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaya Prada","original_name":"Jaya Prada","popularity":1.14,"profile_path":"/annu4gnsyB8uGC7ipgNfXQVCbK6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60f558b253866e0046673825","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kader Khan","original_name":"Kader Khan","popularity":0.9435,"profile_path":"/gf0v2N4xKNGDfHN5lxk7yxUEYQ3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"60f558bbf1759c004660d53a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Om Shivpuri","original_name":"Om Shivpuri","popularity":0.2333,"profile_path":"/sTfUqYGDjfNoGCXySG9PuFNsQKa.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"60f558c6af58cb002f3a9cc7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":601266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ranjeet Bedi","original_name":"Ranjeet Bedi","popularity":0.4014,"profile_path":"/fEMTpkUtx29RYBOVTEoXo8BRElC.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"60f558d3ad87f70073a8ec78","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Satyendra Kapoor","original_name":"Satyendra Kapoor","popularity":0.203,"profile_path":"/bUCaTNUuNkueIb1zAEiunqLfK5.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"60f558dd5545ca0044bc445e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dinesh Hingoo","original_name":"Dinesh Hingoo","popularity":0.1849,"profile_path":"/6kFqFn1k0Tg6GPKIeatZFA1Tdff.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"60f558e612c6040074468ae5","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Govardhan Asrani","original_name":"Govardhan Asrani","popularity":0.4893,"profile_path":"/zoZRnIHNkCRq4gKZGaQhbtPrIDj.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"60f558f012c604002da76ce7","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"K Raghavendra Rao","original_name":"K Raghavendra Rao","popularity":0.235,"profile_path":"/aXUNYnHOFs7GTJPKkscsFjtbUgo.jpg","credit_id":"60d5f67d109cd0005f77677e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":174606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kader Khan","original_name":"Kader Khan","popularity":0.9435,"profile_path":"/gf0v2N4xKNGDfHN5lxk7yxUEYQ3.jpg","credit_id":"60f5590933a533007542fb29","department":"Writing","job":"Dialogue"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0187344","wikidata_id":"Q6983034","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":868,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/paEqKKFbkeKx81ATa3ogxGou8ip.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":650}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
