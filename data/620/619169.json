It was created in the 19th century, and was first heard in 1900 - at the World Exhibition in Paris, where it represented Russia and won the Grand Prix. A year later, the instrument was installed at the conservatory. Since then, he had to go through a lot of events that undermined his health: wars, revolutions, flooding ... Restoration, carried out in 2014-2016, revived the creation of the French master Aristide Kawaye-Call to life. The film, created on the basis of unique filming inside an organ, demonstrates the restoration process and offers to look at the instrument as a living organism - a breathing giant with a thousand voices.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Симфония органа","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Simfoniya organa","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2373648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Uvarov","original_name":"Sergey Uvarov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3e94b721621b132aeecb49","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2373648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Uvarov","original_name":"Sergey Uvarov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3e94be34e15236d6e7a385","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2373648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Uvarov","original_name":"Sergey Uvarov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3e94a421621b1101ee0e97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e7GWT1XbyvxGiZWGZNVwC2FOhAH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Window To Europe Russian Film Festival","release_date":"2019-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
