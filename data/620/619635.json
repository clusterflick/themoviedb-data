The girl was killed, but the demon continued to live in the castle of Father Petrosinus, who carried out the exorcism and sold the building shortly afterwards.  Centuries later, one of the last relatives of the priest enters the castle. Alina Grimm and her friends want to shoot their final student film, a horror movie, in the castle. Unsuspecting that their presence will conjure up Rapunzel Gothel's demon again, they roam the castle to take test shots for their project. But the demon wants revenge... and if he can't have the Father, then at least a relative of the same blood.","popularity":0.539,"poster_path":"/bBjPojWcHDftxNH0PTD8vpw08wj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78565,"logo_path":"/pr3mWx0dga9aMV3BojNtmEnrC74.png","name":"Ghost Pictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rapunzels Fluch","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Curse of Rapunzel","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1687059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Davis Schulz","original_name":"Davis Schulz","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Leonard Koch","credit_id":"5d419fcf34e15216ffe8d7fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Krug","original_name":"Michael Krug","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/9USEKgJJ6t8wcl1qJMy32fl2n93.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Barkeeper","credit_id":"5d41a00634e15243cde70fe3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1375050,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Brückner","original_name":"David Brückner","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/zA9bTpZHSJsyo8Ms2o6zeRDRUrI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"David","credit_id":"5d41a01395acf00013b12926","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2375463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael von der Brelie","original_name":"Michael von der Brelie","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Thomas Eilert","credit_id":"5d41a02234e15263e7e82c79","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2375465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tabea Georgiamo","original_name":"Tabea Georgiamo","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/f698n9OuXuWAG4iWSL8yUQiHUNF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Alina Grimm","credit_id":"5d41a02d95acf0000fb12a1b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2375467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Swan","original_name":"Sophie Swan","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Emily Hirsch","credit_id":"5d41a03c34e15243cde71067","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivia Dean","original_name":"Olivia Dean","popularity":0.1332,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Rapunzel","credit_id":"5d41a04fb87aec2c3d4172fb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2375481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hartmut Engel","original_name":"Hartmut Engel","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Herr Berger","credit_id":"5d41a1df34e15243cde7134f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1710189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillipp Betz","original_name":"Philipp Betz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/kIXGeChTUnBykxeOUuBKu6xDTaA.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Brother Jacob","credit_id":"6631105d90cf5101286d8229","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2394805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacob F.
