One lives in a barrack, where all ceilings have rotted and the ceiling is about to collapse - but the house is not considered emergency. Across the road is another quarter. In it - strong houses, walls in four bricks. But they should be demolished. One of the residents does not agree to move. She intends to fight for her house to the end. The film is about how, in modern urban policy, profit increasingly begins to prevail over logic and justice.","popularity":0.0885,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Obnoxious","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Nesnosnye","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2374826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrey Titov","original_name":"Andrey Titov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d408e1634e1525defec4dec","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2186165,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Irina Snezhinskaya","original_name":"Irina Snezhinskaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d408e5f168ea30010d3ea94","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2182500,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Oleg Vernichenko","original_name":"Oleg Vernichenko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d408e20172d7f001221bb59","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2374826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrey Titov","original_name":"Andrey Titov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d408dfc34e1525dacec354d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2374828,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olga Talantseva","original_name":"Olga Talantseva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d408e45168ea30010d3ea6e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AsG25Ssls6w94nz4X4CNHOJ3bea.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival on Human Rights \"Stalker\"","release_date":"2018-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
