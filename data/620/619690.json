One man is an Acadian woodlot owner retired after nearly 40 years in a pulp mill; the other is a painter and winemaker with homes in France and New Brunswick. The activitists travel to Finland, home of UPM-Kymmene, one of the largest licence holders of New Brunswick Crown lands, to urge company officials to practise responsible forestry. They also go head-to-head with the provincial government to secure a new community-based forestry policy that is environmentally sustainable and produces more jobs than the highly mechanized techniques used today.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/lE6DtIh6IAS03wFuq8sF4aBqONJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forbidden Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2375676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Guy Comeau","original_name":"Jean-Guy Comeau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d41cceab87aec7f0f3a612d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Wishart","original_name":"Francis Wishart","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d41ccfe34e15223b3e75c89","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2375683,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jonathan Collicott","original_name":"Jonathan Collicott","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d41cd9834e15243cde77cd6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2375680,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lloyd Salomone","original_name":"Lloyd Salomone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d41cd6d34e15216ffe94b3d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2375679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin W.
