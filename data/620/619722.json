To this is added a slowly evolving flicker effect derived from negative-positive reversals, progressively dismantling the distance from the subject. Nakai created a masking film with a calculated pattern of black and white frames into which he inserted positive and negative images and made a print out of two separate rolls of film. The original projection speed was 16 frames per second, but the sound is separate from the open-roll tape rather than burned in, so it can also be screened at 24fps. Also, the original sound consisted of the friction noise of rubbing steel, but in 2019 a new version of the sound was created featuring the friction noise of glass. Two versions of the film exist: 24:15 mins at 24 fps and 40 mins at 16 fps.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lWPf6RMTHgvXail3JJR9bPFsGHc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alchemy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Renkinjutsu","type":"Romaji"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2375818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tsuneo Nakai","original_name":"Tsuneo Nakai","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/sZCYBMDSlGrihdvP7frZwKMd5IS.jpg","credit_id":"5d41f7c134e15263e7e8e91d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.573,"height":873,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lWPf6RMTHgvXail3JJR9bPFsGHc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8dHZhQoLdOOS0YTN8BJMa4WRUz5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":837}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
