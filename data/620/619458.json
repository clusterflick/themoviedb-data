Many people lived, or at least tried to live peacefully and constructively. The great Fyodor Shalyapin sang and staged opera performances in Moscow and Petrograd; director Vsevolod Meyerhold played the Lermontov Masquerade on the stage of the Alexandrinsky Theater, and Anna Akhmatova and Sergey Eisenstein applauded him. The future writer Konstantin Paustovsky eagerly absorbed impressions about the life of summer and autumn Moscow. And in the Moscow region estate Lopasnya-Zachatievskoe a happy accident led to the discovery of the longest manuscript by A.S. Pushkin, who was considered lost. The film is built on cinema and photo chronicles of a century ago.","popularity":0.0897,"poster_path":"/548psYxrnU5kwjz3zjGe4rnrWeI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unknown 1917","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Neizvestnyy 1917-y","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2308061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Galina Evtushenko","original_name":"Galina Evtushenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tgDBZq6AHcWywc1Pm2alfGi2Btp.jpg","credit_id":"5d408abb168ea30012d3e4ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2308061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Galina Evtushenko","original_name":"Galina Evtushenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tgDBZq6AHcWywc1Pm2alfGi2Btp.jpg","credit_id":"5d408acb168ea30011d3e4ff","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2308061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Galina Evtushenko","original_name":"Galina Evtushenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tgDBZq6AHcWywc1Pm2alfGi2Btp.jpg","credit_id":"5d408ad134e1525dacec305d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2374813,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Viktor Listov","original_name":"Viktor Listov","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/evc2yj9S7K6l9jiO75EUlRfLUKq.jpg","credit_id":"5d408aed34e1521fb8e9b4fa","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2113353,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Viktor Dobronitsky","original_name":"Viktor Dobronitsky","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/lWVHW4rYEIq4y9dWcf1EwkyI6v8.jpg","credit_id":"5d408b32172d7f001121ac98","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2374816,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Dmitriy Petukhov","original_name":"Дмитрий Петухов","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d408b55b87aec6aa33b2871","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2374820,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Levon Oganezov","original_name":"Levon Oganezov","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/1JR6ilEDO1jDKDJPSdd5olJwwTi.jpg","credit_id":"5d408b8a172d7f000e21a78f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2374821,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Evgeniya Pozharishchenskaya","original_name":"Evgeniya Pozharishchenskaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d408beab87aec61c23a7afe","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iq5I3qyK90fWJxguS8sw3DdCnKh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/548psYxrnU5kwjz3zjGe4rnrWeI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/548psYxrnU5kwjz3zjGe4rnrWeI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Window To Europe Russian Film Festival","release_date":"2019-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Rus Doc Film Fest","release_date":"2018-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Unknown 1917 Trailer - Неизвестный 1917-й, Трейлер","key":"dZlimpWuyV8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-10-12T02:17:13.000Z","id":"5d408c819cc67b001377e296"}]}}}
