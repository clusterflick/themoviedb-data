From the dregs of Viking feasts, to the finest restaurants in Copenhagen, these 2 countries have evolved a totally unique cuisine. In this exciting documentary with roving chef Merrilees Parker, she travels to Scandinavia to find out if there's more on the menu than smorgasbord and smelly fish. In Sweden she enjoys the Midsummer festival, tries some aquavit and samples some sausages. Across the border she tries Danish pastry, tours the Carlsberg factory and watches herring being fermented and smoked.","popularity":0.2992,"poster_path":"/ksSmK021IZhcCeiz6sIVq2XXeNX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pilot Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2007-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Planet Food: Scandinavia","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2356161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merrilees Parker","original_name":"Merrilees Parker","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5d3fe1ce9cc67b0010764f8a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2374460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lesley Brandon","original_name":"Lesley Brandon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3fecfc34e15238fcea9b9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2356860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Cross","original_name":"Ian Cross","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3fe23c34e1521105e97c17","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":1110,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ksSmK021IZhcCeiz6sIVq2XXeNX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":753}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":509,"name":"denmark"},{"id":5475,"name":"scandinavia"},{"id":9935,"name":"travel"},{"id":10637,"name":"food"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
