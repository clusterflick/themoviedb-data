Sasha, beaten by life, when we meet her, lives in a cluttered and untidy village house somewhere in the Moscow Region with her husband, with whom they swear dirtyly in the presence of their young son Ilya. Sasha smokes, drinks and endlessly suffers from a lack of love and from the fact that no one can understand it. Three years later, the viewer again sees her life - in another place, with another man and with a new child, but in about the same circumstances.","popularity":0.1144,"poster_path":"/hFvJ8Ixvktz6K3aN7lDdwfa8BHp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113708,"logo_path":"/cZQdS8LJGgGQuimc0eqM9OazDzO.png","name":"TV-3 Channel","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's Been Three Years","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Proshlo tri goda","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Three Years Later","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandr Rastorguev","original_name":"Alexandr Rastorguev","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/8D5HUEwMcmvTtw1DIBJRxqV9SRg.jpg","credit_id":"5d4055789cc67b0014776eb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1118071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zosya Rodkevich","original_name":"Зося Родкевич","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/hCdZUUK7HHCTlFYjRtDFZgwbq6L.jpg","credit_id":"5db93823a1d3320017e91fce","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2144831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariya Pavlova","original_name":"Mariya Pavlova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/4Ynk8joCZU2InlPO301Bj3iopXg.jpg","credit_id":"5db93882d2c0c100161a3112","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2111816,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilya Malkin","original_name":"Ilya Malkin","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/uirLX63VNTIjSbg4rNO68ZtyMZm.jpg","credit_id":"5db938ab0792e10013478d5c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1131172,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Susanna Baranzhieva","original_name":"Susanna Baranzhieva","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/jV9Sr9NDZWMG6uVNxYhjdWbFTz.jpg","credit_id":"5db937f40f2fbd001775eaf1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandr Rastorguev","original_name":"Alexandr Rastorguev","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/8D5HUEwMcmvTtw1DIBJRxqV9SRg.jpg","credit_id":"5db9385fa1d3320011e86f7d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1787958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liza Kozlova","original_name":"Liza Kozlova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db938700f2fbd001775ed03","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1139989,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arina Adju","original_name":"Arina Adju","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/LyRaKIMZq70Yw6pM9ngVXqPFRz.jpg","credit_id":"5db9382c2d37210015eaa43b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2107953,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kirill Synkov","original_name":"Kirill Synkov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db938362d37210013eb2480","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2444419,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ivan Razinkov","original_name":"Ivan Razinkov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db938c60f2fbd001775ed77","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2111815,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Evgeny Takhmazyan","original_name":"Evgeny Takhmazyan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db938e4a1d3320017e92199","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2111814,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexey Marchenko","original_name":"Alexey Marchenko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db938b72d37210019ea9bb0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dqC42eJxgQNIPpPR9biWnWwEh8G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/hFvJ8Ixvktz6K3aN7lDdwfa8BHp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
