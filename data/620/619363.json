The work combines miscellaneous forms of theatre genres such as drama and comedy and also reveals the act of creating artistic situations. Two men act out these questions in a choreographed performance in which a pair of shoes and socks, a false moustache and a broken chair are the props for their games. A latent homo-erotic tension and a subtle power struggle provide the narrative base. Nashat, always interested in the dynamics of the body, builds up an outrageous tension, which is unpredictably dissolved by a physical incident reminding of a very popular slapstick element.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2VZXMzAM0AR6cF3m9K41LutJVTr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Modern Body Comedy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1784905,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shahryar Nashat","original_name":"Shahryar Nashat","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/r8264Wwov3HMm5jAX4EN3qlkXGy.jpg","credit_id":"5d3ff8549cc67b001476854a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2VZXMzAM0AR6cF3m9K41LutJVTr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
