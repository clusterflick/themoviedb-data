She signed with Paramount Pictures and went on to a flourishing career at MGM. She made 54 films in 17 years before a series of unfortunate events led to her being unfairly blacklisted. After the blacklist, she championed humanitarian causes, forging a career as one of Hollywood's first celebrity activists. She was the FIRST Angelina Jolie. As far back as 1955, Eleanor Roosevelt was a mentor of hers as they both worked tirelessly to support the work that the United Nations Association was accomplishing in this country. At age 96, Marsha continues to fight for causes she believes in. This film is a call to action for activists of all ages.","popularity":1.8808,"poster_path":"/bTFCL6IFTJp3Wqsh0fpZANSSm1P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marsha Hunt's Sweet Adversity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1215925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marsha Hunt","original_name":"Marsha Hunt","popularity":0.4358,"profile_path":"/r4vTrX77yxFSTbIYXZVWRaDfCZ3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d423ebc7719d70011623f10","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonard Maltin","original_name":"Leonard Maltin","popularity":0.1889,"profile_path":"/5jQo1L8Vv10nZQQeMgSaCjLxJlB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d423ec395c0af0017d7ee1c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Belafonte","original_name":"Harry Belafonte","popularity":0.5959,"profile_path":"/8x9zZS36gSOKiTnUwoBqYKvnYg6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d423ed0d8cc4a001633ceb6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148560,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Norman Corwin","original_name":"Norman Corwin","popularity":0.1191,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fd44595b76cbb003c7c56b6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valerie Harper","original_name":"Valerie Harper","popularity":0.4485,"profile_path":"/el6TS0gsoHNesv96zRscA1y94f3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d423edc7719d70011623f31","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":162708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill A.
