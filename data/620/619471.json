Alexander's life is an endless struggle for survival. Instead of a shop, there are mountains, instead of a refrigerator, a stream, instead of the Internet, a walkie-talkie. For 20 years he has not been to the city. Someday he wants to go on a world tour, to see Tibet, Rome, Australia. But for now, deer, nature and a dream are all that he has.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/ki14DQrrBCYyMNPOwrps0fe5d6h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123800,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eon Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Northern Wind Can Be Warm","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Северный ветер бывает тёплым","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Severnyy veter byvaet teplym","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Severnyy veter byvaet tyoplym","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2374865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Golovkov","original_name":"Alexey Golovkov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4094b1168ea30014d3f897","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2374865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Golovkov","original_name":"Alexey Golovkov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4094db9cc67b001277f0fb","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2374865,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexey Golovkov","original_name":"Alexey Golovkov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4094e19cc67b001077efe3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2374866,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mali Pos","original_name":"Mali Pos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4094fab87aec03793b5a4a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2374869,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Natalya Lacheva","original_name":"Natalya Lacheva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d409534168ea30010d3f547","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2374872,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Samed Bagirov","original_name":"Samed Bagirov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d40955c34e1525defec59b5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4hwN8iYNlCjpo0RsPlGkdtG9brb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ki14DQrrBCYyMNPOwrps0fe5d6h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Window To Europe Russian Film Festival","release_date":"2019-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
