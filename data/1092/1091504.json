The Millennium concert, recorded live on 25 June 2000, gathered more than 22.000 people in one of the most appealing outdoor amphitheaters in Europe for one of the most popular classical music concerts in the world. Kent Nagano named his program of popular and rather unusual music from the 20th century “Rhythm and Dance”. It turned out to be an inspiring combination of classical pieces, show tunes, pops, and Far Eastern music, all brought together in a tasty musical stew and rightly labelled as one of the most exciting programmes ever performed at the Waldbühne. It featured Gershwin classics with an outstanding performance by the American mezzo soprano Susan Graham, music by Ravel and the soundtrack to the successful Chinese film “Farewell My Concubine.”","popularity":0.1025,"poster_path":"/fDbMJzJrzKclctce2Gw7EaUdFSF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2255,"logo_path":null,"name":"EuroArts","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Night Of Rhythm & Dance (Waldbühne 2000)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Waldbühne 2000: A Night of Rhythm & Dance","type":"Alternate"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":574386,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kent Nagano","original_name":"Kent Nagano","popularity":0.1053,"profile_path":"/rghOfYl9H5zMgfGqJdWSCZtPS8U.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"63f9cab36aa8e000968efa52","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1724539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Graham","original_name":"Susan Graham","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/zVIJJZFhPDkBz5K9ZGBkH6Lt0ti.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mezzo-Soprano","credit_id":"63f9cad825a536008362fe65","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2897270,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Berliner Philharmoniker","original_name":"Berliner Philharmoniker","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Orchestra","credit_id":"63f9cafb344a8e00aa1b143f","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1424027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Coles","original_name":"Bob Coles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f9cb1457176f00bcbf680f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139125,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Smaczny","original_name":"Paul Smaczny","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/fRVXsWwbRhsVjVJgCFVsEpF4JKC.jpg","credit_id":"63f9cb246aa8e000c62bf7c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":574386,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kent Nagano","original_name":"Kent Nagano","popularity":0.1053,"profile_path":"/rghOfYl9H5zMgfGqJdWSCZtPS8U.jpg","credit_id":"63f9ca8e344a8e008ec531a9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fDbMJzJrzKclctce2Gw7EaUdFSF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
