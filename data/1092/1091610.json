Dharmanna is the head of Pandavapuram and is considered as the latest descendant of the Pandavas, while Suyodhana is the head of Kauravapuram and also is considered as the latest descendant of the Kauravas. As expected, Dharmanna is a good Samaritan while Suyodhana is a dangerous criminal who runs a quarry business. Similar to the tale of Mahabharata, here in this film too, Dharmanna and Suyodhana play the game of cards in which Suyodhana fails, which makes him follow the stipulation of the game - no celebration, marriage, and any good events should not be conducted for 14 years.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dfk1LkN6ZIAKad2BI7JpTZqCL8X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pandavulu Pandavulu Tummedha","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1416,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dfk1LkN6ZIAKad2BI7JpTZqCL8X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
