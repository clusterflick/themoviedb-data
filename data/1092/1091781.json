On November the 12th, millions of miles from Earth, a spacecraft will make history by attempting to land on an icy rock nearly three-miles across, hurtling through space at 41,000 mi/hr. An international team of scientists will work around the clock to make sure the orbiter Rosetta, and lander Philae, will survive the journey to accomplish their mission. If successful, Rosetta and Philae could help peer into our past and unlock secrets from our very origins. The stakes couldnâ€™t be higher.","popularity":0.073,"poster_path":"/kFdMgaJ6egXtfiTWk63ya49bfJG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Comet Catcher: The Rosetta Landing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4542310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Fortune","original_name":"Jack Fortune","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"65d110f3f9475b0149d9f348","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2207637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed Watkins","original_name":"Ed Watkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d11162f9475b0149d9f372","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4542312,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jochen Hasmanis","original_name":"Jochen Hasmanis","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d11180b422420187b1e67d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2261773,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Enge Gray","original_name":"Enge Gray","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d111cfb422420163b1dc28","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3491326,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter Thorn","original_name":"Peter Thorn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d11147b422420187b1e64e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2122370,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Isis Zahiruddin","original_name":"Isis Zahiruddin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d111b4bf31f2018760b557","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kFdMgaJ6egXtfiTWk63ya49bfJG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
