At school, Dot is treated so cruelly that she runs away, but a kind farmer takes her to the police station and she is returned to her parents. When Dot's father becomes involved in a scheme to smuggle arms into Mexico, Dot's photograph prevents newspaper owner Robert Chase from exposing him. Repentant, Dot's parents finally give her the love she had so sorely missed.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1918-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Children Wanted","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Joy","original_name":"Gloria Joy","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/nzCAjjMWpi4s5s4HWzOFzBh2Tg5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dot Jarvis","credit_id":"63fa66f568929c00a4a29c07","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sherwood MacDonald","original_name":"Sherwood MacDonald","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fa66b884f24900ef612fa0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0187356","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1918-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
