A surreal exploration of the dynamics at play amongst five radicalised environmentalists and the motivations that lead them to carry out the kidnapping of a major UK political figure in order to achieve their masterplan.\r Â \r A conceptually structured intuitive foray into the narrative boundaries of the cinematic medium by way of a 25 page script with 5 lead characters only. Shot 5 times, in 5 days. Each time, each actor plays a different character. Each time, the shooting style varies: general, super 8, theatre, multilingual, & documentary.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/mVjY7CmMNOCBRD7X7BOqDoKmGUp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What do we want?
