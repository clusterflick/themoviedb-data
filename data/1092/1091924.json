Directed by award-winning filmmaker Clifford Bestall, this film offers a unique glimpse into the life of Nelson Mandela at a point when, in his own words, he ‘retired from retirement’. The filmmakers were given unprecedented access to Mandela from the beginning of his 90th year until his final retreat from public life. The resulting documentary is an intimate portrayal of one of history’s most respected and revered statesmen. Nelson Mandela – The Final Chapter includes never-before seen footage of Mandela’s last ever tour abroad, as well as private meetings and discussions with admirers, celebrities, heads-of-state and ordinary people. It is a privileged insight into his time in retirement, the final chapter in a remarkable life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xc13PnX2VaZ5qGCFHO9zOGJnzyO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nelson Mandela: The Final Chapter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xc13PnX2VaZ5qGCFHO9zOGJnzyO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
