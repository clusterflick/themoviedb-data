Emerging from abstract geometric landscapes, we lock in on a boy with his father embracing in the middle of a rainy forest. Soon they are descending to the bottom of a lake to discover a hidden city. There, the boy enters a door and finds himself walking through his father’s memories, or maybe it’s his own future, or somehow both.","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":"/9OlPsycNsd0yjZsL7iLQ45mzbQP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2619340,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zak Engel","original_name":"Zak Engel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f905183d74540086d5adb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2619340,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zak Engel","original_name":"Zak Engel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f9052168b1ea0082f6bce0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3429455,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Masayoshi Nakamura","original_name":"Masayoshi Nakamura","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f9052c68b1ea0082f6bce5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22473728","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9OlPsycNsd0yjZsL7iLQ45mzbQP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Picture Farm Film Festival","release_date":"2022-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
