This film in six sections combines spontaneous improvisations, tape slide shows with colour and black and white photographs, interviews with 15 years old girls and boys from the Bethnal Green area, with facts and statistics compiled by the THIRRC Tower Hamlets Research and Resources Centre. The unusual format is used to communicate information about living and working conditions in the borough of Tower Hamlets, making a socialist and anti-government critique of the policies of the Conservative administration under Margaret Thatcher.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/5BIzE2JZTGQ4FsJyVByzhRuayQj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Is That It?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wilfried Thust","original_name":"Wilfried Thust","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fa3d8c25a536008bf49f4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5BIzE2JZTGQ4FsJyVByzhRuayQj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":770}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
