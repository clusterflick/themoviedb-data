But on the 14th of October 1943, the inmates fought back, in the biggest and most successful prison outbreak of the Second World War. Told through the firsthand accounts of four survivors--Toivi Blatt, Phillip Bialowitz, Selma Engel-Wijnberg, and former Russian POW Semjon Rozenfeld--and using dramatic reenactments, Escape From a Nazi Death Camp recounts the true horror of life at Sobibor, and the desperation, determination, and courage of its prisoners. Of the 600 inmates present on the day of the escape, 300 escaped into the forest surrounding Sobibor. Of that 300, many were shot, turned in, murdered, or captured by Nazis. Around 50 survived the war and of that 50, only a handful are still alive. Now in their 80s and 90s, this is their last chance to reveal, in their own words, the true story of the day they escaped certain death to freedom.","popularity":0.3346,"poster_path":"/zeJBDijPMwRPTl1O4e1TVX1RQ2C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clear Cut Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Escape From a Nazi Death Camp","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Meyers","original_name":"Eric Meyers","popularity":0.1942,"profile_path":"/nmR4ZZsvprYWyBJQGJ7tSC8Lcb6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"narrator","credit_id":"66fa6541807cd51c17f17f5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Beckett","original_name":"Andreas Beckett","popularity":0.0953,"profile_path":"/yjNZohwfKPQ5HmpvmltU1rlRNhE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Alexander Pechersky","credit_id":"66fa6662807cd51c17f17f6e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1465954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Nikoloff","original_name":"Georg Nikoloff","popularity":0.1325,"profile_path":"/vhGgKtOP855NbFCv2IakOeEyL1i.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Leon Feldhendler","credit_id":"66fa67629c686a460213267c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Clements","original_name":"Peter Clements","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/5ObdoWXwy3NWoumg0URlfqLGNZj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Chaim Engel","credit_id":"66fa67901c5df25f10cfff92","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1800367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanna Herbert","original_name":"Susanna Herbert","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":"/2cNbzmXEbL8xvf6KTmWaczpa44f.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Selma Engel","credit_id":"66fa67b2807cd51c17f18020","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4970966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bart Stanislawek","original_name":"Bart Stanislawek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Toivi Blatt","credit_id":"66fa67d8807cd51c17f18044","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5234136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Ludwig","original_name":"William Ludwig","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"SS Officer Frenzel","credit_id":"67a79d7a5fa42d7e76f11ec7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4971613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Longstaff","original_name":"Martin Longstaff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Philip Bialowitz","credit_id":"66fa68609c686a460213271f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1538091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Werner","original_name":"Simon Werner","popularity":0.181,"profile_path":"/4zcvVYM0r9NQCW66VuOdgN1VPCX.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"66fa68a69c686a460213273f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2106044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Gumm","original_name":"Richard Gumm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"66fa68c1c59a2db32dd00120","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321326,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hereward Pelling","original_name":"Hereward Pelling","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66fa62f5cc43cebd03f181e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zeJBDijPMwRPTl1O4e1TVX1RQ2C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
