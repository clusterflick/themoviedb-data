A student and protégé of Freud’s, and one of the most radical figures in the history of psychotherapy, Reich famously claimed to have discovered orgone, a form of life energy pervading the universe. Shot in his home and laboratory in Rangeley, Maine, OR119 transmutes Reich’s writings into song, while also conjuring into existence a series of impossible encounters between Reich and a selection of contemporary feminist writers. A theoretical musical that’s as playful and liberating as it is formally challenging and intellectually provocative, OR119 is suffused with its own unique artistic life force.","popularity":0.0611,"poster_path":"/x04SSC3yDDa4y8Iy1ZqWc81aJGc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"OR119","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1040521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacqueline Goss","original_name":"Jacqueline Goss","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f8b2a6d1ca2a00b27ae393","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peggy Ahwesh","original_name":"Peggy Ahwesh","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/2PpqxpTqv2HN5yQMusOQCcZly4l.jpg","credit_id":"63f8b26a46f35400bc68f19b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/x04SSC3yDDa4y8Iy1ZqWc81aJGc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York Premiere, Anthology Film Archives. http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&month=03&year=2023#showing-55648","release_date":"2023-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
