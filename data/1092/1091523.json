Synopsis\r A young man who lives in an attic in a suburb in Thimphu goes about his daily routine – chanting prayers, watering the dying flowers, browsing through social media, and watching men his age play futsal through a small window in his attic. Everything is mundane. Ordinary.  But behind the façade of this ordinariness, he is trapped in the attic – powerless, stagnant and immobile. Outside his attic, life goes on as usual.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":194315,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leywang Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dzongkha","iso_639_1":"dz","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"manintheattic shortfilm bhutan","title":"The Man who Lives in the Attic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3938250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lobzang Jurme","original_name":"Lobzang Jurme","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/o16GSlRjBW4sYB5ugHmMpWNdCp2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Thinley","credit_id":"63f9e92384f249008db000e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3938251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonam Zangmo","original_name":"Sonam Zangmo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/mVUFs690ZaDOIBy74wp6W7ihiiO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sister","credit_id":"63f9e94325a53600b70894d5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3938252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thinley Wangchuk","original_name":"Thinley Wangchuk","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zLuuuvKnUDnU2Ak7KGdPSgU03Rz.jpg","credit_id":"63f9e9c4344a8e00aa1b1efa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3938253,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Pema Tenzin","original_name":"Pema Tenzin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f9e9f584f24900ef6105db","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3938258,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sonam Rinzin","original_name":"Sonam Rinzin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f9eb2225a536008bf480e8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3938259,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kunzang Norbu","original_name":"Kunzang Norbu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f9eb5496e30b0087f7a8df","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3938261,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tandin Chophel","original_name":"Tandin Chophel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f9eba2344a8e008ec53c29","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3938252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thinley Wangchuk","original_name":"Thinley Wangchuk","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/zLuuuvKnUDnU2Ak7KGdPSgU03Rz.jpg","credit_id":"63f9ec1496e30b0087f7a925","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3938265,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kinley Tshering (Big B)","original_name":"Kinley Tshering (Big B)","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f9ec67344a8e00867c8372","department":"Writing","job":"Script Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3938269,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leywang Films","original_name":"Leywang Films","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f9eca3344a8e00867c8391","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3938274,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Warapol Wangrawaipol","original_name":"Warapol Wangrawaipol","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f9ecd196e30b008325de59","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"dz","note":"Beskop Film Tshechu film festival Premiere","release_date":"2021-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"dz","note":"Samuh OTT.
