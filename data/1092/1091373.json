The film’s nested structure is a way to keep images and their symbolic load at a distance. It opens a new space of negotiation wherein new associations can be shaped. They function as a starting point for the writing of a history in movement and produce narratives which then become touchstones for a new kind of historicisation. In the second part of this second chapter, Mondzain analyses another visual material: that of the rushes recorded during the shooting of the first chapter. These rushes could have been left invisible, or rather 'unseen'- the same way some of the Algerian’s historical figures are not represented on the pictures of the kiosk. In her book, L’image peut-elle tuer? [Can the image kill?], Mondzain defines the 'unseen' as what is waiting for meaning in the community debate. The unseen would then be a sort of unexploited archive, waiting for the gaze to expand.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1Cx0CusBdGU2Ev2hUG5TPZMy9Ku.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Algerian Novel, chapter 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345645,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katia Kameli","original_name":"Katia Kameli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63f948c096e30b00dd6fc0e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1069,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Cx0CusBdGU2Ev2hUG5TPZMy9Ku.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":713}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
