Luke dreams of being on stage while doing B2B marketing work that feels completely meaningless. His coworkers all sip a red kombucha beverage and seem to have found purpose in this place. When his job seems threatened, and his future as a musician seems bleak, Luke decides to give the free kombucha a try. A feeling of commitment, focus, and belonging washes over Luke as he churns through creating a pitch deck for an upcoming client meeting. Unfortunately, the kombucha has a series of nasty side effects that grow and writhe inside of Luke. Kombucha is a short film that gives new meaning to being consumed by your work.","popularity":0.0498,"poster_path":"/kEyfQm9oa0vL1DGlQIELBOjcJo0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":213070,"logo_path":null,"name":"Take Care Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Don't drink the Kombucha!","title":"Kombucha!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2637988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire McFadden","original_name":"Claire McFadden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kelsey","credit_id":"654c063941a5613368860685","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4365001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terrence Carey","original_name":"Terrence Carey","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/eRhIwM15DVuB9k1evkuoxb6JWK6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Luke","credit_id":"654c065741a561336b7a0338","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4365002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Rowell","original_name":"Andy Rowell","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Adam","credit_id":"654c0662532acb533a144a22","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1956461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jake Myers","original_name":"Jake Myers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f21ef7de2d52dfbd8d617e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29344136","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/erpdYg3uJwLcyTGKtxhKs0VezT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":2803,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kEyfQm9oa0vL1DGlQIELBOjcJo0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":324725,"name":"kombucha"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Kombucha! | Teaser Trailer","key":"dW_wPhLfNBI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-10-23T15:34:26.000Z","id":"654c060db18f3200ffec7091"}]}}}
