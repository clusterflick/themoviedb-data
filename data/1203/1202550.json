The artist and his film caused a scandal in 90s France, which suddenly realized the violence of the epidemic and the upheaval it would bring for its children... Collard's work still resonates today, through its depiction of the rage of life and sexual freedom, and the courage it takes to face up to the inevitability of the virus. This documentary is supported by powerful archive footage, allowing us to rediscover the destiny of a striking artist. It is also based on the testimonies of those who knew him and agreed to talk about who he was, the driving forces behind his rebellion and his way of creating. The film is also punctuated by readings from some of the thousands of letters sent to Cyril Collard, revealing what it was about his work that struck a chord with viewers, especially younger ones.","popularity":0.1366,"poster_path":"/MmKRre3j9VfKkqesjgZiNzifS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63251,"logo_path":"/ljeZdkJP2W5ag4PEo3Om5XAwGTF.png","name":"Brainworks","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cyril Collard : À la vie, à l'amour","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127283,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cyril Collard","original_name":"Cyril Collard","popularity":0.1731,"profile_path":"/2yfTcyNUQ8zqL5l9AkIm3JFRVJo.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"654ce00367b61300c84a2170","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romane Bohringer","original_name":"Romane Bohringer","popularity":0.5748,"profile_path":"/keVDM0uUbKmo0yOVNrjMuKiH1B2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"654ce00ab18f3200e2cfa1ae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050920,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean-Jacques Jauffret","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Jauffret","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"654ce0455a5ed000c6ad0517","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23506,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jacques Fieschi","original_name":"Jacques Fieschi","popularity":0.2591,"profile_path":"/kMrQl31GtC97HbXwvcTFAWGzyUh.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"654ce04eb18f3200ac3ee57a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4366010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louisette Faréniaux","original_name":"Louisette Faréniaux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"654ce058b18f3200c58ded61","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3352388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caroline Halazy","original_name":"Caroline Halazy","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654c65c041a56133693cb938","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30272784","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uR9h3LYgszuQUJDTSFqK6Kl9OJO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/MmKRre3j9VfKkqesjgZiNzifS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
