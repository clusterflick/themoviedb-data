She is excited to know that her children, who have not come home for a while, are coming back for her birthday. She prepares food for their visit but ends up receiving calls, informing her that they are unable to come. The next day, Bok-soon feels pain on her knees and visits an orthopedic clinic where she meets Dong-i. Dong-i tells her of the yoga center opened by Dong-i’s mother. Bok-soon visits the yoga center thinking she could share the left-over food with people there. Neighbors who have not seen her in a long time welcome her, and Young-sook, whom she had loved like her niece, is now the yoga teacher, giving Bok-soon a one-day class. Without realizing, Bok-soon starts to move her aching body to follow the yoga moves.","popularity":0.1176,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2023-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bok-soon’s One-day Class","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1180459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Ja-young","original_name":"김자영","popularity":0.327,"profile_path":"/l0gAbzagSjrALtWN6fb8S5vR39q.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bok-soon","credit_id":"654c8047fd4f8000e481fc64","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4365630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Choi Beom-chan","original_name":"Choi Beom-chan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654c8067fd4f8000e481fc86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul Independent Film Festival","release_date":"2023-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
