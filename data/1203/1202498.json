In a most unusual ballet in two acts, we take a mythological journey with Sesom, a vegan priest who is thrust into an epic voyage to bring color to the black and white underworld. Trenton Doyle Hancock’s comic book-style characters intrigue and enthrall with humorous, original choreography by Artistic Director Stephen Mills and an equally outrageous and inventive score from composer Graham Reynolds. Choreographer, writer, composer and visual artist come together in a creative alliance that is sure to leave audiences delighted and exhilarated.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wY6aGnDFXU4NQ6DnwFpcfI1V2HJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cult of Color: Call to Color","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wY6aGnDFXU4NQ6DnwFpcfI1V2HJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
