In a haze of remorse and bad dreams his gaze tumbles through the cold room. Traces of a former life cast his mind down a spiral of repressed memories. The faded photographs do not bring him solace. A dark entity on the other side of the picture frame has occupied the space where his reflection used to be. It leads him into an abyss with no means of escape: the depths of his own consciousness. He is seeking answers, why fate has led him into a realm of desolation. But the further he dives into his own past, the more he realizes that he has been living a lie.","popularity":0.3444,"poster_path":"/hBXzMOma7WrI171JsxIqeyfHH5p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No
