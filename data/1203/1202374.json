Blurring the line between what's real and what's not can be achieved with a gesture of the hand, or the tensing of a body. Life of a Mime explores a day in which the performance never ends. A nameless entertainer, the titular mime can't catch a break. Beginning with an unenthusiastic crowd his day goes from bad to worse as he contends with a society that doesn't seem to quite understand nor tolerate him. Things then take a turn for the drastic when he arrives home, penniless. Come and enjoy this dark comedy which shows that a day in the Life of a Mime isn't always so black and white.","popularity":0.1007,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":213043,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filigree
