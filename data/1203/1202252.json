It’s a grind and the band is ready to call it a day when Benny, the band’s oldest and most needy member, hears of a Battle Of The Bands competition for tribute bands at The Niney Dimey.  As the band arrives to load in their gear, things begin to go awry rather quickly. A disturbance in the main room of the venue rapidly gets out of control forcing Bjorn and his band to take cover backstage. Some of the other bands are injured from the fracas outside, injuries which soon present a problem when the wounded begin to metamorphose into bloodthirsty undead.","popularity":0.3797,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Bjorn of the Dead","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Dickinson","original_name":"Bruce Dickinson","popularity":0.2388,"profile_path":"/gSS9DyrF7M2NG9y5otnq728PfR4.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Bjorn","credit_id":"654b97974f33ad00c7189afa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99074,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elza Kephart","original_name":"Elza Kephart","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":"/1YCIEzmGSxNOdmqXcZIPjBcaGob.jpg","credit_id":"654b96ba67b61300e5dc8e86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4364268,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Austin Dickinson","original_name":"Austin Dickinson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b96df2866fa00c4263fa5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":54895,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Paszt","original_name":"Michael Paszt","popularity":0.1376,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b972b4f33ad013b93579b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136971,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"James Fler","original_name":"James Fler","popularity":0.0675,"profile_path":"/m7OVaRSzvPsLhccGaGYVQdNxEE.jpg","credit_id":"654b9736532acb5339fe48eb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340301,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Prendergast","original_name":"Andrew Prendergast","popularity":0.0989,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b9711fd4f80013ceb0e11","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":136972,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrew Thomas Hunt","original_name":"Andrew Thomas Hunt","popularity":0.0765,"profile_path":"/lCgMoEtjXtgrbiuteMa1dZmeAHS.jpg","credit_id":"654b97452866fa0138a93ceb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1340301,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Prendergast","original_name":"Andrew Prendergast","popularity":0.0989,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b970729383500ab52bc1f","department":"Writing","job":"Original Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29871639","wikidata_id":"Q123370652","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":316611,"name":"abba"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
