Born and raised under siege and frequent onslaughts these children, including Amani, Musa, Israa, and others, provide vivid accounts of their encounter of bombardment and the constant presence of drones in their sky. The children describe their perceptions of missile strikes through sensing vibrations in the air, trembling of the ground, and the resonance of collapsing buildings. The film also questions whether the deafness of these children is a natural or a consequence of Israel’s use of sonic weaponry, such as sonic booms.","popularity":0.0755,"poster_path":"/wHaSXamBBnDEFFvTJMWqXGyHoq6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vibrations from Gaza","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4363224,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rehab Nazzal","original_name":"Rehab Nazzal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654acb5efd4f8000ae2c57e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohammed Nateel","original_name":"Mohammed Nateel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6751b6a0f043bd8a60272592","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2392561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samir Nawar","original_name":"Samir Nawar","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/4ngggsAgrqDIYQVe6dme5aFwX1A.jpg","credit_id":"6751b6b237f185620208725c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed Abu Elkas","original_name":"Mohamed Abu Elkas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6751b6c1fa107dc4ed402e68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2rDm38M64i07p7bK5SAIYxyygog.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wHaSXamBBnDEFFvTJMWqXGyHoq6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
