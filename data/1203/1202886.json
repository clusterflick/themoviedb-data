However, the inquisitorial camera discovered the malnourished child under the bridge, in the poor neighborhoods... in the arms of the marginalized woman. And the documentary tells us something else: as long as these living conditions persist... the cry of the malnourished child will persist.","popularity":0.0753,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":110556,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centro Costarricense de Producción Cinematográfica","origin_country":"CR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CR","name":"Costa Rica"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desnutrición","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2342503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Freer","original_name":"Carlos Freer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d3f89b18f3200c58e0829","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2342506,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Víctor Vega","original_name":"Víctor Vega","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d3fdb2866fa10928b9187","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234691,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kitico Moreno","original_name":"Kitico Moreno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d3fe8fd4f8000c7fefde0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4352359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Vilaplana","original_name":"Jorge Vilaplana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d3ff467b613011f42113b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1702342,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Yglesias","original_name":"Antonio Yglesias","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656776d8c2b9df011dfda835","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1702342,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Yglesias","original_name":"Antonio Yglesias","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656776fda8b2ca00c987152f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2342503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Freer","original_name":"Carlos Freer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65677712a8b2ca00c987153a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
