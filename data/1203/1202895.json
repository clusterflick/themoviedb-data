Filmed in two halves, the first is voiced by Blandy, who is white and middle class, born in London, of English heritage. He alludes to intelligence tests, racist and sexist discrimination, and the systemic use of sterilisation across the Western world, all under the guise of objective science.  In the second half of the film, a lyrical yet powerful account that questions the limits of empathy in the struggle against injustice, suggesting that what is needed is not simply solidarity but real change, which would necessitate the demolition of generations of privilege. This part of the film visually invites the viewers into an immersive videogame environment following a large spider as it travels different landscapes.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":"/xo24Lm83JOu1GqbEuOEJ1wGjhJC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"_GOD_MODE_","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1826254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Achiampong","original_name":"Larry Achiampong","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d4635b18f3200ac3f02cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Blandy","original_name":"David Blandy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d466d41a56133693cfeb9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xo24Lm83JOu1GqbEuOEJ1wGjhJC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":937}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Commisioned for exhibiton","release_date":"2023-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
