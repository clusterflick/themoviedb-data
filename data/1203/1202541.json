The writer and director Hiona Henare recreates three oral stories taken from her own tribal histories, in a reawakening of traditional Māori storytelling. Each story centres around a young lead protagonist who must rise to the challenge and defend their people, land and customary practices. The Untold Tales Of Tūteremoana is 100% Māori and celebrates the renaissance of Hiona’s endangered native language. It features an all Māori cast with veterans of stage and screen, along with a new generation of emerging young talent who shine, and are at the heart of each of the three stories.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":500,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A coming-of-age Fantasy-Drama series born of the stars and rooted in the mountains, forests, rivers and sand dunes of Aotearoa (New Zealand).","title":"The Untold Tales Of Tūteremoana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14546202","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
