This is the traditional route Jesus followed carrying his cross from Pilate's Judgment Hall in the Antonia, to Calvary Hill, or Golgotha, the site of the cruxifixction. Along this route are the \"Fourteen Stations of the Cross\". Each station marks an event of sacred memory, with chapels for reflection, convents and monasteries of devotion, and the sacred basilica for commemoration. Station 1 \"Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium\" (John 18:28). Jesus is condemned to death, and on Friday afternoon, when Franciscans started the devotion of the Via Dolorosa, the courtyard of Omariye College is crowded. The minaret located at this place called Antonia Tower marks the site of the Roman Fortress where Jesus was condemned.","popularity":0.0667,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Via Dolorosa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4365678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yanai Arfi","original_name":"Yanai Arfi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654c8abab18f3200ac3ec8b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8330190","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
