Wait until you hear Joe Dombrowski’s compilation of classroom mishaps in his first-ever comedy special, “Don’t Eat the Crayons.” Having escaped the classroom after 10 years of being an elementary educator, Joe is now able to say it like it is. Trust us when we tell you he does just that in this 30 minute of non-stop chaos. Gone to school? Have a kid? Know a kid!? You don’t have to be a teacher to get a kick out of “Don’t Eat the Crayons.” Crafted with nothing but truth, Joe leads you through his time with unfiltered kindergarteners, odor-ridden 5th graders, and even the “joys” of teaching about the birds and the bees.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qx2uDsm9MswgaU7kmOkfPMj19GF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joe Dombrowski - Don't Eat the Crayons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":813,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qx2uDsm9MswgaU7kmOkfPMj19GF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":542}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
