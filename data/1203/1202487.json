There he confronts Patient X, whose behavior is so volatile, so mysterious, so infectious that Sam begins to question whether she is really suffering from psychosis or from something far more terrifyingâ€“ something not to be cured but destroyed. The Coming is a psychological thriller that pits good vs. evil, sanity vs. insanity, and has us questioning which one is which.","popularity":0.0998,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Coming","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Panitch","original_name":"Seth Panitch","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sam Allyn","credit_id":"654c25ec1ac2927b2dcfaf27","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1603166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jyreika Guest","original_name":"Jyreika Guest","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"\"Patient X\"","credit_id":"654c260afd4f800101b84e98","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1785705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baron Kelly","original_name":"Baron Kelly","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Chaplain Clark","credit_id":"654c270b1ac2927b2f27e0d0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1827920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Alexander Sieder","original_name":"Anne Alexander Sieder","popularity":0.1205,"profile_path":"/9vWia3OFfivzg0NdWOcY4twNrH4.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Dr. Bonner","credit_id":"654c2731532acb5339fe7665","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Panitch","original_name":"Seth Panitch","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654c259b4f33ad011e036d8e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667800,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Panitch","original_name":"Seth Panitch","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654c24ed497560011d348e7b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4365267,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rahim Branch","original_name":"Rahim Branch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654c25c7b18f3200ffec7a22","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Greer","original_name":"Aaron Greer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654c24d467b61300e5dcb683","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Greer","original_name":"Aaron Greer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654c25795a5ed000c6acb467","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22462914","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
