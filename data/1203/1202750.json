Featuring Ty Ippolito and Murray Urquhart.  When Chloe Simmons was just six years old, she witnessed her father being arrested and taken away in handcuffs. The trauma of that moment still haunts her every night. Recently, her family was evicted from their home and Chloe was given a cardboard box by her mother. On her way to school, she finally opened the box and found a kitten inside. Overwhelmed with emotion, Chloe cried on the subway while other passengers looked on. A little girl behind her wanted to play with the kitten, but Chloe couldn't bear to let it go. She eventually got off the subway and daydreamed about her father coming to rescue her from her difficult life. When she woke up on a bench at a bus stop, she was still clutching the box and her backpack.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Crooked Taled Cat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3916052,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ty Ippolito","original_name":"Ty Ippolito","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/iWC0wr7o4sUYM27KtCqGAy3UWXn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"DEA Officer (as Tyler Ippolito)","credit_id":"654d018529383500ab533e68","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4366208,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murray Urquhart","original_name":"Murray Urquhart","popularity":0.0684,"profile_path":"/wFHlwgN9GOzmwKb8niIuUNSr6tJ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"654d022829383500ab533e9f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3562569,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Danny Sedore","original_name":"Danny Sedore","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d024a41a561336a24f585","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3562569,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Danny Sedore","original_name":"Danny Sedore","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d02611ac2927b2f28364a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4366216,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex Grewenig","original_name":"Alex Grewenig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d045e1ac2927b2f2836c2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4366215,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eric Tesainer","original_name":"Eric Tesainer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654d044241a56133693cebbe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4067456","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
