Their lives resemble two parallel lines that will never meet.  The first is a graduate of the Seder yeshiva who adheres to the teachings of Rabbi Kahana and believes in the Land of Israel for the people of Israel.  The second -- a Palestinian who belongs in his identity to his brothers in the neighboring Arab countries.  Ephraim is disturbed that the Arabs \"raise their heads too much\" while Osama feels oppression towards Arabs by the government.  According to the circumstances of their lives, they probably would have \"meeted\" in violent events between Jews and Arabs, but despite the great paradox - in the film something surprising was created between them.  \"Go wash the sea\" is a docu-film that touches on the open wounds of Israeli society, wounds that are talked about in a whisper, in silence.  Can the impossible be made possible?  Is it possible to stretch the sea?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wYdoYFZBrpScGZk0laZIKUL4wa0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Go sweep the sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4363991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ephraim Agami","original_name":"Ephraim Agami","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"654b57121ac2927b2c824f8c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4363992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Osama Halaila","original_name":"Osama Halaila","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"654b5734fd4f8000e4818f7a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4363993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yehonatan Biran","original_name":"Yehonatan Biran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"654b57672866fa00fe0184b2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4363994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadin Abu Rea","original_name":"Nadin Abu Rea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"654b57821ac2927b2ebe04c6","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4363993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yehonatan Biran","original_name":"Yehonatan Biran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b5820fd4f8000e4818ff6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4363994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadin Abu Rea","original_name":"Nadin Abu Rea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b582d67b61300afc8d2b8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4363993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yehonatan Biran","original_name":"Yehonatan Biran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b57a767b613013c4a642d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4363994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadin Abu Rea","original_name":"Nadin Abu Rea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b57c24f33ad013b933ffd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4363994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadin Abu Rea","original_name":"Nadin Abu Rea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b580d4f33ad011e032bcf","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4363993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yehonatan Biran","original_name":"Yehonatan Biran","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654b57f8532acb533a140ab2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":997,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wYdoYFZBrpScGZk0laZIKUL4wa0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":665}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"לך תרצף את הים روح بلط البحر  - 2015","key":"JgyzGkwOH0o","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-05-03T07:53:59.000Z","id":"654b5a0f1ac2927b3029a111"}]}}}
