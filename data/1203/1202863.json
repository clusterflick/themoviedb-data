The search is complicated by a disturbing myth about the Cave Banshee, a vengeful spirit from the Nordic folklore that once lured miners to their deaths in the reserve's treacherous caves. As they delve deeper into the forest, Viktor starts to question his own sanity and whether the rumored Banshee is more than just a myth. To make matters worse, Angelica and Viktor share a painful history with the haunted place. Viktor must now confront his troubled past and work together with Angelica to survive the night and unravel the mystery behind the woman's disappearance.","popularity":1.1285,"poster_path":"/mDuePf1neIsvsUfN9tlnNObwjZd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":220488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eyra Media","origin_country":""},{"id":220489,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pentagram Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2024-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Nordic Myth Awakens.","title":"From Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":6.111,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4528457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rakel Benér","original_name":"Rakel Benér","popularity":0.1179,"profile_path":"/cgW294Fo7xnPPVzmtq5OaZdOmTe.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Angelica","credit_id":"65c740eb54a0980184018e4f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1960503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Skagerberg","original_name":"Oscar Skagerberg","popularity":0.1586,"profile_path":"/5PifkDBuh46vmuTZpCzB6r8GZuU.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Viktor","credit_id":"65c740fe54a0980184018e60","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2176264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Mörlin","original_name":"Peter Mörlin","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/2chaMZvDmtW4tihWEj6kN610yra.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Johan","credit_id":"65c7410a9451e701847ae323","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Hedengran","original_name":"Thomas Hedengran","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/pirNrwqBfDKKS6f8eMMRfznAxWD.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Stefan","credit_id":"65c74119a3144001658d12c9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3388717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Kilpeläinen Arvidsson","original_name":"Amanda Kilpeläinen Arvidsson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/5oCQQE9LhwJYOciNPNn3CtnEPq8.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"65c7412caad9c20164b5f09b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1611278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lennart B.
