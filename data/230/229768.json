Four young friends set out to research and live this reality. Armed with only a video camera and a desire to understand, they spend just 56 dollars each for 56 days in rural Pena Blanca, Guatemala. They battle E.Coli, financial stress, and the realization that there are no easy answers. Yet, the generosity and strength of their neighbors, Rosa, Anthony and Chino gives them resilient hope. They return home transformed and embark on a mission to share their new found understanding with other students, inspiring and challenging their generation to make a difference.","popularity":2.4261,"poster_path":"/1w9MQn2itNBaWPZdtsDHIYmo6l6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89129,"logo_path":null,"name":"Creative Visions Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":96301,"logo_path":null,"name":"living on one","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GT","name":"Guatemala"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"56 DAYS | 56 DOLLARS | HOW DO YOU SURVIVE?","title":"Living on One Dollar","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":88,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","title":"Bir Dolar İle Yaşamak","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Vivendo Com Um Dólar","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Temple","original_name":"Chris Temple","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4f029251416c7516a0e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264514,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ryan Christoffersen","original_name":"Ryan Christoffersen","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4f029251416c7516a0eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zach Ingrasci","original_name":"Zach Ingrasci","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4f029251416c7516a0ef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264512,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sean Leonard","original_name":"Sean Leonard","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4f029251416c7516a0f3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264512,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sean Leonard","original_name":"Sean Leonard","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f029251416c7516a0dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Temple","original_name":"Chris Temple","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f029251416c7516a0e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264512,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sean Leonard","original_name":"Sean Leonard","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f029251416c7516a105","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264512,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sean Leonard","original_name":"Sean Leonard","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f029251416c7516a0ff","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zach Ingrasci","original_name":"Zach Ingrasci","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f029251416c7516a0d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264514,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ryan Christoffersen","original_name":"Ryan Christoffersen","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f029251416c7516a0f9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2625598","wikidata_id":"Q17113034","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1w9MQn2itNBaWPZdtsDHIYmo6l6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1899,"name":"hunger"},{"id":157634,"name":"parasite"},{"id":163092,"name":"guatemala"},{"id":169358,"name":"financial problem"},{"id":238854,"name":"one dollar"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Living on One Dollar Official Trailer #2","key":"Ze72rpWp_Dg","published_at":"2012-08-14T16:35:52.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec71fc3a368544800b5d9"}]}}}
