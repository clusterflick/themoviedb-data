In the years since Hurricane Sandy, the city has been brought to its knees by a series of 'Frankenstorms.' As hurricane season hits yet again, New York braces itself for the oncoming wave of destruction. Roommates Margot and Daniel attempt to survive this 'new' New York by avoiding it at all costs. But with the advent of three strange deaths in their Brooklyn building, the world they've been hiding from is knocking hard on the back door. They soon discover that the salad days of getting drunk and watching horror movies are behind them, because they have a new roommate, and he's got a real bug up his ass.","popularity":0.2014,"poster_path":"/5FZaWKXK1BYCJBysrwS3nlZPZOX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When New York falls ... they will writhe","title":"They Will Outlive Us All","video":false,"vote_average":4.429,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessi Gotta","original_name":"Jessi Gotta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Margot","credit_id":"52fe4ee59251416c751661c7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":561908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nat Cassidy","original_name":"Nat Cassidy","popularity":0.1159,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Daniel","credit_id":"52fe4ee59251416c751661cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alyssa Simon","original_name":"Alyssa Simon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Claire","credit_id":"52fe4ee59251416c751661cf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gavin Starr Kendall","original_name":"Gavin Starr Kendall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ian","credit_id":"52fe4ee59251416c751661d3","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264289,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Shearer","original_name":"Patrick Shearer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ee59251416c751661d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessi Gotta","original_name":"Jessi Gotta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ee59251416c751661df","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3018560","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yBbkKbAd218jJcfnYxnjqKZEAmP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5FZaWKXK1BYCJBysrwS3nlZPZOX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1057}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"They Will Outlive Us All - Official DVD Trailer","key":"wfQBe3Jzzv0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2015-01-24T04:22:58.000Z","id":"5f089e3e55bc3500332239b1"}]}}}
