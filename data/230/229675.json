With a lineup featuring Derek St. Holmes, the original vocalist &amp; rhythm guitarist for the Ted Nugent Band from the 70s, plus Greg Smith (ex-Rainbow) on bass and Dokken s Mick Brown on drums, Nugent is in classic \"Uncle Ted\" form on this new live release. This man has a rock n roll soul like no other. Nugent is pure Detroit Rock N Roll dynamite, infused with a bit of Motown &amp; blues. His guitar playing is superb and mind blowing. The man is a mad talent, no doubt and Ultralive Ballisticrock proves this beyond a shadow of a doubt.","popularity":0.1834,"poster_path":"/t9tBQZDpG3fIC9k1G2PH74Yk8Ew.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ted Nugent - Ultralive Ballisticrock","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":170468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Nugent","original_name":"Ted Nugent","popularity":0.2632,"profile_path":"/8jHbx8a5GAFRcpoBBLDYTIT8sRG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Guitars, Vocals","credit_id":"5cc774e4c3a3684936848ecd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3215001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derek St. Holmes","original_name":"Derek St. Holmes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/vn4z5M9ASNK97rRqbQdphxEepWf.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Guitars, Vocals","credit_id":"612a3e9b12197e008b74c498","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3215003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Smith:","original_name":"Greg Smith:","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/8sLgfVvurAz3Y83dnYhXeJZTUkh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bass","credit_id":"612a3ec142f19f0095783160","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1842536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Brown","original_name":"Mick Brown","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/i50wi6L3iE9HeNoUwZnceZ5evQE.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Drums","credit_id":"612a3ed606f9840063715925","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sZImIE3QQlLAkrr8zhvABZurxjL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.757,"height":1285,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t9tBQZDpG3fIC9k1G2PH74Yk8Ew.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":973}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
