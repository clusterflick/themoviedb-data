Lucky is a US-based software professional, and is a teetotaler, always abiding by the pressure and demands of his parents, so much to the fact that he does not have the courage to speak out that he already has a girlfriend. Bharath Kumar, the youngest son, the character played by Diganth, is a carefree individual with weird ideas on life. Bharath meets a tomboyish girl, Ambika, who is the house-owner's niece, and they begin to mingle well due to the nature of their personalities.  However, following a few unusual twists and turns, the alliance is called off and the groom's family members walk out due to embarrassment. Ambika, who has now developed a strong feeling of love towards Bharath, goes ahead and confronts him. And finally, Bharath too says yes.","popularity":0.3039,"poster_path":"/nTNvKatbiE2auu81dFwJPDRB7Wu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17585,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yograj Movies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2010-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kannada","iso_639_1":"kn","name":"?????"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pancharangi","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153925,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Pawan Kumar","original_name":"Pawan Kumar","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/AlcjBeU5GfuwqS3OZFfwivbnvzX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bharat Kumar","credit_id":"52fe4ef09251416c7516790b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1264023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nidhi Subbaiah","original_name":"Nidhi Subbaiah","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":"/jGHbCobAyjSQyMdjhLSPYuxFA0n.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ambika","credit_id":"52fe4ef09251416c75167913","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anant Nag","original_name":"Anant Nag","popularity":0.2903,"profile_path":"/4XeYuoZX15cks43HRavV75RjlmN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Wanderer (Nameless)","credit_id":"52fe4ef09251416c75167917","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":988335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramya Barna","original_name":"Ramya Barna","popularity":0.1533,"profile_path":"/y6yOJmgTVh4RaaIWQ7XSOo1aHUm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Latha","credit_id":"52fe4ef09251416c7516791b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1210127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Padmaja Rao","original_name":"Padmaja Rao","popularity":0.2198,"profile_path":"/yWgw3RvADEjDttRVVTJrrRcgSw9.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Padma","credit_id":"52fe4ef09251416c7516791f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nagendra Shah","original_name":"Nagendra Shah","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/7muQChZReFvo1hCKufOGMCxBsIO.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Narayan Rao","credit_id":"52fe4ef09251416c7516792b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raju Talikote","original_name":"Raju Talikote","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Raju Talikote","credit_id":"52fe4ef09251416c7516792f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264028,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mithra","original_name":"Mithra","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Keshavananda Swamiji","credit_id":"52fe4ef19251416c75167933","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diganth Manchale","original_name":"Diganth Manchale","popularity":0.236,"profile_path":"/o5T3X15zNomtDt5CumYBVZ3FIdI.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Bharath Kumar","credit_id":"57a5f5fe9251410eda004c57","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":584930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Priyanka Upendra","original_name":"Priyanka Upendra","popularity":0.3524,"profile_path":"/5LD7zCD2wfPtsU5j8pyJZloqxcD.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Cameo","credit_id":"595259c4c3a36809c6022d64","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1210130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sudha Belawadi","original_name":"Sudha Belawadi","popularity":0.1702,"profile_path":"/pFyCsVlGpScNh36HvaYuI9pZuQf.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Vaishali","credit_id":"5e5fb7f755c9260017572ab7","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1979890,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jayanth Kaikini","original_name":"Jayanth Kaikini","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/6TfAYZDnNSSYNIymWdaFRJjSXEg.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"J.K Sir","credit_id":"65686eea9affc0012d279e59","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122167,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yogaraj Bhat","original_name":"Yogaraj Bhat","popularity":0.1817,"profile_path":"/h0Ur2niouhlsqWoOFDyrgo7bUoJ.jpg","credit_id":"5e902badfdc1460011477e91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343061,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mano Murthy","original_name":"Mano Murthy","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e902c18d35dea001374ec3f","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2596220,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"V.
