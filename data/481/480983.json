Travelling the globe, they meet top scientists, technologists and engineers who are working to answer our biggest questions: is there another planet out there that we could call home? How will we travel across the vast distances of space to get there? How will we survive the journey? And how will we set up a new human civilization on an alien world?  Taking in the latest advances in astronomy, biology and rocket technology from the Atacama Desert to the wilds of the Arctic, viewers will discover a whole world of cutting edge research. This programme shows that Professor Hawking’s ambition isn’t as fantastical as it sounds - and that science fiction is closer to science fact than we ever thought.","popularity":0.0704,"poster_path":"/aXKD27Oi6wYAvCnef6HC7mcxCZn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80625,"logo_path":"/daJWIUoMzMWflmcerIoUpLWA38F.png","name":"Brook Lapping
