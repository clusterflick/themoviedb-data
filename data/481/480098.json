In November 2006, twenty-five armed officers raided Michael Schmidt’s Glencolton Farms as he drove up the lane in his old Blue Bus on the way to deliver raw milk to his cow-share members in Toronto. Officials confiscated raw milk, cheese-making equipment, computers, and files. This film follows a year in the life of a Canadian activist farmer as he struggles to provide his “farm fresh milk” while battling authorities. Schmidt prepares for his trial and attempts to find a political solution to legally provide raw (unpasteurized) organic milk in Canada.","popularity":0.302,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":95928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Snowy Owl Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Story of Raw Organic Milk in Canada & A Consumer's Right to Choose","title":"Michael Schmidt: Organic Hero or Bioterrorist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Raw Milk Crusader: Michael Schmidt","type":"CBC Airing"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Schmidt","original_name":"Michael Schmidt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself - Raw Milk Farmer","credit_id":"59da641392514124c9046327","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hazel Lynn","original_name":"Hazel Lynn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself - Medical Officer of Health Grey Bruce","credit_id":"59da6538c3a36861a3044fe8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mansel Griffiths","original_name":"Mansel Griffiths","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself - PhD, Director of Research Institute for Food Safety, Guelph University","credit_id":"59da65d392514124eb04552e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milena Corredig","original_name":"Milena Corredig","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself - PhD, Research Chair, Food Science, Guelph University","credit_id":"59da6629c3a368624d043e31","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy Hillier","original_name":"Randy Hillier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself - Ontario Landowners Association","credit_id":"59da6692c3a368623e045275","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Thuet","original_name":"Marc Thuet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself - Chef and Owner of  Thuet Restaurant","credit_id":"59da66d1c3a36861ec045d59","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Mitchell","original_name":"Bill Mitchell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself - Dairy Farmers of Ontario","credit_id":"59da6731c3a368620d03e742","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark MaAfee","original_name":"Mark MaAfee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself - Organic Pastures Dairy Co.","credit_id":"59da676692514124c5046a83","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Ventham","original_name":"Tom Ventham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself - Farmer at Plaw Hatch","credit_id":"59da679dc3a36862000476da","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902535,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Norman Lofts","original_name":"Norman Lofts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59da6448c3a36862000471f9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":238605,"name":"biodynamic agriculture"},{"id":238673,"name":"civil disobedience"},{"id":238674,"name":"raw milk"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
