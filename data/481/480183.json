Nonetheless, every week, on T.V. and online, we are bombarded by the bizarre media-spectacle of North Korea. From nuclear apocalypse and prison camps to banned sarcasm and compulsory identical haircuts - any shred of information regarding North Korea becomes a viral media hit, regardless of how dubious the story is.  But that's all about to change.  Two Aussie boys decided to take matters into their own hands and go to North Korea to find out the truth for themselves. Join us as we look past the click-bait and unpack the forces behind the way our media represents the \"Democratic People's Republic of North Korea\".","popularity":0.1917,"poster_path":"/m6bwS2ulT0TaC6aAMZVGUQfvEWz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A North Korean Adventure","title":"The Haircut","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yCGkoJYBeI3ynvYcGECYXNNCfHX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.739,"height":928,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m6bwS2ulT0TaC6aAMZVGUQfvEWz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":686},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":936,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gxXJy2DF5W7Wj7T3qEE6DUpFOI3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":702}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2903,"name":"propaganda"},{"id":6007,"name":"media"},{"id":1773,"name":"socialism"},{"id":173644,"name":"communism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
