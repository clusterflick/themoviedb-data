The production goes through Forugh Farrokhzad’s intellectual growth, artistic and philosophical development and self discovery. It also looks at dimensions of the transformation she attained in her last two collections: “Rebirth” and “Let’s Believe in the Beginning of a Cold Season.” The program discusses, in a biographical and analytical approach, the major themes, poetic imagery, and social-political messages  expressed in her poetry. It examines the impact of her work on the women’s movement in Iran. Selected poems are partially recited. The documentary also covers her cinematic experiences and how they helped her to enhance her poetic imagery in later work, as well as her association with well-known writer and film maker Ebrahim Golestan.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6lCFfQo3olbisDF3pU68efC1fNO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Documentary About the Life and Work of a Pioneering Iranian Modern Poet","title":"I Shall Salute The Sun: Forugh Farrokhzad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mansooreh Saboori","original_name":"Mansooreh Saboori","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59da2478925141252c03fa16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6lCFfQo3olbisDF3pU68efC1fNO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
