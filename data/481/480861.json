His adventures take us to the era of “pre-cinema”, to the times of magical lantern and Chinese shadows. He is the first director of Nigerien cinema and animation films in Africa. He tells very old stories with current technology, but he also narrates the most current events with the most archaic means. This documentary not only tells the adventure of a human being and an extraordinary professional, but the memories of a generation, the history of a country, Niger, in its golden age of cinema.","popularity":0.1044,"poster_path":"/o6oEZ7pxndxAIHuSdTOr1HwCE78.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96071,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinédoc Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moustapha Alassane, Cineaste of the Possible","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323276,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moustapha Alassane","original_name":"Moustapha Alassane","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59df8942925141251f0a79a3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1904535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Lelong","original_name":"Christian Lelong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59df894f925141252c0a1a13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1904535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Lelong","original_name":"Christian Lelong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59df8967925141251f0a79d9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1904536,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Silvia Bazzoli","original_name":"Maria Silvia Bazzoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59df895c925141251f0a79c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1904537,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"François Sculier","original_name":"François Sculier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59df897a92514125050a0f85","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8412292","wikidata_id":"Q3326301","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o6oEZ7pxndxAIHuSdTOr1HwCE78.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
