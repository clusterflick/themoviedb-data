In his own time, Harg works on ideas for a revolutionary new manufacturing process for hard steel. When his father is badly injured in a workplace accident resulting from employer negligence, Harg uses some of the compensation payment to develop his invention to a stage where it can be tested in practice. It is a huge success and Harg patents his process. He rises to a position on the board of the company, before staging a coup to oust his former employer and take over the business himself.","popularity":0.3181,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":95984,"logo_path":null,"name":"Langham Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1932-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Men of Steel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Stuart","original_name":"John Stuart","popularity":0.2048,"profile_path":"/j8j6VrLDNbezpBmbs8MlIAZKI5A.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"James 'Iron' Harg","credit_id":"59db88e4c3a3686227059cd3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":131726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benita Hume","original_name":"Benita Hume","popularity":0.1724,"profile_path":"/iKRa5qqa6vKQ4GCr86HSPzE9yHe.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Audrey Paxton","credit_id":"59db88fb92514124c505efb1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franklin Dyall","original_name":"Franklin Dyall","popularity":0.1977,"profile_path":"/q1LqODYAL8tvKBvITTV7JqPw0IX.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Charles Paxton","credit_id":"59db8911925141252c05c835","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":93897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heather Angel","original_name":"Heather Angel","popularity":0.3058,"profile_path":"/aL4rV0rDtnNjHocXITevohuj9e2.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Ann Ford","credit_id":"59db8929c3a36861df064b31","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Field","original_name":"Alexander Field","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Sweepy Ford","credit_id":"59db893dc3a368620005ff3b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1889638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sydney Benson","original_name":"Sydney Benson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Lodger","credit_id":"59db8953925141250505c4fa","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":92698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Merrall","original_name":"Mary Merrall","popularity":0.1154,"profile_path":"/2zC8xZt70ccGqXYdPiFU1Bk6JMS.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Mrs. Harg","credit_id":"59db896bc3a36861df064b7d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Ashley","original_name":"Edward Ashley","popularity":0.3011,"profile_path":"/jCM1ZSyH2nyMbRZ1mK6DH2a5mOY.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Sylvano","credit_id":"59db898792514124c905ebcc","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1903034,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lilian G.
