The story is a gradually unfolding spiritual crisis, juxtaposed through two central characters: a young child, full of curiosity and wonderment, and a hard-working, 32 year-old butcher struggling to begin his own family life. It ultimately exposes the harsh social difficulties in sustaining a modest, middle-class life within the contemporary American culture of systemic decay.","popularity":0.0352,"poster_path":"/64592sIetIR0Wm1kS7SOmw6nEGv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
