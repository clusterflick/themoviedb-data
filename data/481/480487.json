Aparecida has devout followers of all social classes, religions and regions of the country. Aparecida is a symbol of the maternal heart, kindness and tolerance. All people fit underneath the mother’s cloak. Aparecida goes beyond the church which she represents and transcends the differences so that all feel welcome in her home. The film is constructed by different characters that have emotional, relevant and particular stories about their faith in Aparecida.","popularity":0.1184,"poster_path":"/bHg4WQDMPvdocO6sPMlEj6oNmTs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13969,"logo_path":"/bEpiJ2zXGIH70JT16asjWNFtOEv.png","name":"Globo Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Imagem da Tolerância","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Bethânia","original_name":"Maria Bethânia","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/lpEyghSwC6H21pYoWtuncmR5jLP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d4966482d1e400199c22b06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2380235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lina Boff","original_name":"Lina Boff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d49666b028f14001201eb52","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2380236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nilton Bonder","original_name":"Nilton Bonder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d4966812d1e4011e9be0386","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2380237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fábio de Mello","original_name":"Fábio de Mello","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d496694a0be287cfda27493","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2380238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darci José Nicioli","original_name":"Darci José Nicioli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d4966ada0be287cfda27521","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1315031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nany People","original_name":"Nany People","popularity":0.1899,"profile_path":"/alZzwXCAHUWSrv7Zr9R5dskKbRY.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d4966c0a0be287cfda27560","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1095866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elba Ramalho","original_name":"Elba Ramalho","popularity":0.1283,"profile_path":"/mvADo7bWe45oCtEnb1pD1ruaRYt.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d4966d4028f146b01002ca5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2380239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Osmar Raposo","original_name":"Osmar Raposo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d4966fa2d1e40266dbdfd4f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2380240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Rimpoche","original_name":"Michel Rimpoche","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d49670c2d1e400199c22c3e","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1182348,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joana Mariani","original_name":"Joana Mariani","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59dcbc6692514124cd07569a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1486869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paula Trabulsi","original_name":"Paula Trabulsi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59dcbc7592514124eb073110","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532431,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anderson Capuano","original_name":"Anderson Capuano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e36f4af4ca676001753181e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2349051,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eduardo Gripa","original_name":"Eduardo Gripa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e36f4ba98f1f10012053b74","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1182348,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joana Mariani","original_name":"Joana Mariani","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e36f4c8ac8e6b001ac5455b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7770022","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bHg4WQDMPvdocO6sPMlEj6oNmTs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
