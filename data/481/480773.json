Immediately discharged from the hospital following her hastily executed brain surgery, Elizabeth Murray wanders the streets in a curious haze, her personality visibly affected by the botched cerebral procedure. Upon spotting the man of her dreams wandering along the beach in a similarly confused manner, Elizabeth lovingly brings the disoriented man back to her apartment in hopes of nursing him back to health. Following an allergic reaction to her environment that forces Elizabeth to wrap her entire apartment in plastic, a bloody mishap with her new beau quickly spirals into a murderous, and quite noisy, rampage of good intentions gone horribly awry.","popularity":0.3714,"poster_path":"/9xJBi7demfd3JJbIbHpxxLJvl78.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The French Guy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106532,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Babs Chula","original_name":"Babs Chula","popularity":0.2448,"profile_path":"/8AVQQb6vYWuyjpYK8a07ExNk5OZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5a513219c3a368752300eac5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tygh Runyan","original_name":"Tygh Runyan","popularity":0.4048,"profile_path":"/8mMiOuq4jf6lT9wBT2wiRZcwxBT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5a5132260e0a260266010c9f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carly Pope","original_name":"Carly Pope","popularity":0.6155,"profile_path":"/i2yFxKvqmeJElTRTaOWw6b4HRRc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5a51322f925141132c01030c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1916943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heidi Iro","original_name":"Heidi Iro","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a513240c3a368753400f83d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4223196,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allie Amy Goodfellow","original_name":"Allie Amy Goodfellow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64eaa808839018011f8db927","department":"Directing","job":"Second Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1561511,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ann Marie Fleming","original_name":"Ann Marie Fleming","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59ded99992514124eb09777a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0476657","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/CWJGjRdq3jMZBwswvUF0z371vD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9xJBi7demfd3JJbIbHpxxLJvl78.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
