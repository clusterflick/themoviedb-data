The little bears give him a bag of 'speedy-grow' in stead of weed-killer, and the weeds thrive and take over his garden. Worms are feasting on his tomato crop, and the anti-worm spray he uses engulfs him rather than the vines. Papa Bear, worn-out, in pain and bandaged, is in his easy-chair when the same commercial, that earlier had inspired him, comes on again, and the angry bear rips open the television set and throttles the announcer.","popularity":0.1508,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":42019,"logo_path":"/mFPTppw3q4tY9R2b7QxVv4zevLi.png","name":"Terrytoons","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Growing Pains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1215430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Halee","original_name":"Roy Halee","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Terry Bear (voice)","credit_id":"59dac05ac3a368620004e75a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1290066,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philip A.
