Assuming that they are now aristocratic heirs, they take a trip to visit their wealthy relations. They soon discover that Chaseville is a back-country hick town, and that their kin are dirt-poor illiterates who ambulate in bare feet. Nevertheless, Pappy (Charley Chase) could use Jimmie to defend him in a breach of promise lawsuit. Miss Lavinia Watkins sued him for not tying the knot, after pledging to marry her. The case is resolved as the courtroom becomes a dance floor, and everyone celebrates.","popularity":0.2802,"poster_path":"/kIKQXJlzOjUHQjYGVzvJlxjxJKr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Southern Exposure","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Chase","original_name":"Charley Chase","popularity":0.3584,"profile_path":"/bIJBRLtjiZtrq3c9uDYn1Cl5a7J.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Colonel Charley Chase / Pappy Chase","credit_id":"59dd40b8c3a368623e07bb83","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1074235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Constance Bergen","original_name":"Constance Bergen","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":"/69k1HZWXcWdEfyNY4mIZllYaswI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Connie Chase","credit_id":"59dd40cc92514124c507ef25","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Burns","original_name":"Bob Burns","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":"/zqAOM3BjNjdNz4jiPq7t2lzZM4T.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jimmie Chase","credit_id":"59dd40f292514124cd07f1bb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Davidson","original_name":"Max Davidson","popularity":0.1765,"profile_path":"/yo57wZr0Fx0hyklCf0ykqPIOqVU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Man Saluting Charley in Restaurant (uncredited)","credit_id":"61d4bf105541fa006790bd97","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":941239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Switzer","original_name":"Carl Switzer","popularity":0.4644,"profile_path":"/vCkSMW92oos0CtHGXJiMk8fl8c0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Messenger Boy (uncredited)","credit_id":"61d4bf1ea22d3e0067b5994a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Chase","original_name":"Charley Chase","popularity":0.3584,"profile_path":"/bIJBRLtjiZtrq3c9uDYn1Cl5a7J.jpg","credit_id":"59dd409392514124c507eef3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0027027","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":814,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kIKQXJlzOjUHQjYGVzvJlxjxJKr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":542}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
