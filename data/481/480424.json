He starts at Windsor Castle, and we see the boys at Eton in their top hats. He motors past the oak trees of the king's riding park, where he strolls up to deer. Then it's on to Thomas Gray's churchyard and to a thatched cottage. Rogers buys 'hollyhawks' from a vendor, stops at Ascot, and goes to Hampton Court Palace to see Henry VIII's private garden and the first tennis court. He concludes with a boat ride down the 'Temms' past country estates, elaborate house boats, and picnicking punters. A stop at a riverside hotel for tea ends the tour. Rogers makes wry observations throughout.","popularity":0.0486,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1927-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exploring England with Will Rogers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Rogers","original_name":"Will Rogers","popularity":0.1814,"profile_path":"/zzJ0FkSjISPUQ1QPskFaKwPJPr7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"59dc4b62c3a368620006ede4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1903358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Stearns Clancy","original_name":"Carl Stearns Clancy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59dc4b53c3a368622706777e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1037050","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1927-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
