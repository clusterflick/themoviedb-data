German spies have been using a Peace Society as a front for their nefarious activities (the rotters!), but our stout lads are on to them. They finally rout the blackguards while on active service in the Middle East - or at least the English field that stands in for it! The eponymous lads actually include a lass, who joins up as a nurse.","popularity":0.0856,"poster_path":"/7Mpg02VR0llQsjXVnm39HZCe3LP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52681,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atlantic","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1919-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lads of the Village","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1391653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Dudley","original_name":"Bernard Dudley","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sir Karl Dusseldorf","credit_id":"59e0769c925141252c0b2c37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1420134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maudie Dunham","original_name":"Maudie Dunham","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/rUnuTeEXZ16d0B9YuOo155Uej2d.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Maud Ellington","credit_id":"59e076af92514124c50b76e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1904970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Learmonth","original_name":"Jimmy Learmonth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"59e076bb925141252c0b2c88","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1904971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"H.J.
