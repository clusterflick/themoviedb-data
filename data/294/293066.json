After rescuing Mary from certain death, the “three bad men” meet her saintly mother and stay on to help on their farm. In The Hidden Way, two of the ex-cons conspire to steal the family’s tiny nest egg, but through plot twists involving a medicinal spring, a wronged woman, a villainous Casanova, his avaricious father, and government inspectors (!), the pair eventually see their error and join the third in turning over a new leaf.","popularity":0.5159,"poster_path":"/457k4E12y9MAhdHVXyPRzxAcpP1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hidden Way","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Carr","original_name":"Mary Carr","popularity":0.226,"profile_path":"/vV3wvbwq2H0X9PjFMU1q9jXnN0Y.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"5417f760c3a36819bd00230c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1050934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Grey","original_name":"Gloria Grey","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/rNBhtINVKUhgbiQN083R1w7Yhzw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"5417f7690e0a26380400228d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Santschi","original_name":"Tom Santschi","popularity":0.2595,"profile_path":"/8TCS8pRx9LjfFXApYZZReYpTFpa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bill","credit_id":"5417f772c3a36819ae0022e7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Rankin","original_name":"Arthur Rankin","popularity":0.1124,"profile_path":"/406G5vX8Lg60SNtqSu4QK0LHcn4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Harry","credit_id":"5417f77b0e0a2637f9002301","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ned Sparks","original_name":"Ned Sparks","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/bRduH9CVoOKfD19dKmlxujvEe4Z.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mulligan","credit_id":"5417f7840e0a263804002292","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1359983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Thomas","original_name":"Jane Thomas","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/zbUMbAeRgyWRgMYezmaCM2eVzu.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"The Woman","credit_id":"5417f7900e0a2637f40022cb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billie Jeane Phelps","original_name":"Billie Jeane Phelps","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The Child","credit_id":"5417f7990e0a2637ef00229a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilbur Mack","original_name":"Wilbur Mack","popularity":0.1858,"profile_path":"/hPd17j7C1PIfbHLhlDpolL6BSuC.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sid Atkins","credit_id":"5417f7a1c3a36819a8002355","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1291364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Ryno","original_name":"William Ryno","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Samuel Atkins","credit_id":"5417f7ab0e0a2637ef0022a4","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph De Grasse","original_name":"Joseph De Grasse","popularity":0.1574,"profile_path":"/xcr9cEXa5nE0ph7PWMucZCAqD8J.jpg","credit_id":"5417f731c3a368199f002432","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037946,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ida May Park","original_name":"Ida May Park","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":"/ju6TBsp9twSFrt0fO4inmIAdRh1.jpg","credit_id":"5ce243e50e0a263f91c9fc28","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2176003,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joseph A.
