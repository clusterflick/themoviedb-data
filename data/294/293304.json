Originated in parts of England, the myth of Jan Jedermann (\"John Everyman\") deals with a rich man on his deathbed coming to terms with his life's failures. Not following much of a plot, the modernized version involves famous fashion designer Jedermann (Klaus Maria Brandauer) imagining his last big gala event while rendered unconscious as a result of a car accident in his Ferrari. He is a success in Vienna but not in fashionable Paris, so he wishes to impress French elder stateswoman Yvonne Becker (Juliette Greco).","popularity":0.5017,"poster_path":"/3CejRcJYKarjYq2duqMEi3qAtC4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10273,"logo_path":"/a3XYUgEqAAuPsNL4xvBZSXGJCt0.png","name":"Filmfonds
