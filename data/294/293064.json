The comedy’s plot is not much: Told by his exasperated father to find a job, a klutzy rich kid named Art (Joe Moore) follows a bevy of dancers to their nightclub, where he tricks the maître d' into hiring him as a waiter.  No guest proves safe from Art’s clumsy antics, but the shapely cabaret performers, led by Mademoiselle Fifi (Gloria Joy), dance on in the ensuing chaos.","popularity":0.1184,"poster_path":"/NJ941mF0XJEYTYiVEe9V8ArtVx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172250,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sherwood MacDonald Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moonlight Nights","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Joy","original_name":"Gloria Joy","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/nzCAjjMWpi4s5s4HWzOFzBh2Tg5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5417f576c3a368199c002338","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Asher","original_name":"Max Asher","popularity":0.1479,"profile_path":"/kjX0PQ1C4tp0sVeqLjux9OMUQxK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5417f5880e0a2637ef002200","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Moore","original_name":"Joe Moore","popularity":0.0386,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Art Gordon","credit_id":"5417f5940e0a263801002211","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfred Roveano","original_name":"Alfred Roveano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5417f59ac3a368199c00234b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barney Williams","original_name":"Barney Williams","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5417f5a0c3a36819b400215a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Williams","original_name":"Clarence Williams","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5417f5aa0e0a2637f4002240","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sherwood MacDonald","original_name":"Sherwood MacDonald","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5417f558c3a36819ae002240","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1037103","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fA3l6FHp4t713XwjcONYnHPzfP4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i6pddIPkgUn7Sk2la1RiTP7I15I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2942,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/NJ941mF0XJEYTYiVEe9V8ArtVx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1961}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1925-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
