In The Hague, the report comes in that in Amsterdam Theo van Gogh has been murdered. All warning bells start ringing. With the country in flames, sometimes literally, politicians and officials in The Hague have to neutralise all sorts of known and unknown stings, and just when Van Gogh’s cremation seems to herald a period of relative peace, a second explosion follows: the attack on the Hofstad Network in the Laakkwartier in The Hague. A reconstruction of nine days of political high tension and flying dust, a decade after the assassination of the trendsetting filmmaker and TV presenter.","popularity":0.4062,"poster_path":"/tmajysIajMaIDKmSbHPGsiceZSE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28103,"logo_path":"/5HcHQuFqmdAgTo7K4t2qnThVBhT.png","name":"Column
