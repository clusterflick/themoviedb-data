Slightly crazy but more likely wise, the cynical homeless prophet initially rejects the good-natured dog, but eventually gives in, forming a bond sealed by her naming her one and only friend, Rascal. At a low point in her life, Sally gains renewed hope through unconditional love for Rascal.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Sally Met Rascal...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1729589","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
