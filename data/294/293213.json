The Brazilian has fallen in love with the picture and wants to marry the girl.  In return for finding her, the village will receive a donation of RM 5,000.  Oh boy!  The mayor, the shoemaker and the district clerk go off on the search for the girl!  They have absolutely no luck in the photo shop, because the photographer is boiling over what he considers unfair intentions and tells them to take a hike.  Nevertheless, they find the girl’s address.  The model, Christl Wallner is no country girl but rather a ballet dancer, who posed for the photo to earn a litle extra money.","popularity":0.4395,"poster_path":"/inx0TkZ9y1MwNwzqg3jS1cDwmcg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26093,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wien-Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1941-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"So gefällst Du mir","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolf Albach-Retty","original_name":"Wolf Albach-Retty","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":"/4hh5ZAV3C7FQ2g4SOngiVkWoiJq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Peter Seidl","credit_id":"5418b4260e0a2624ea000842","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oskar Sima","original_name":"Oskar Sima","popularity":0.2405,"profile_path":"/bQDZxEXLpQ2voIxflksqYzTF8uV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mayor Vitus","credit_id":"5418b43a0e0a2624fa000848","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":26147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gusti Huber","original_name":"Gusti Huber","popularity":0.115,"profile_path":"/m2fRNyh2HC6wcQidw4etYSRkcyd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5418b4470e0a2624fa00084b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Tilden","original_name":"Jane Tilden","popularity":0.1399,"profile_path":"/9e7Uf8xUHgiPmEDxW12n0KsPYYQ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Didi","credit_id":"5418b455c3a3680aca000883","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franz Böheim","original_name":"Franz Böheim","popularity":0.1323,"profile_path":"/l3jBHE1e39KYR89ZeqEgD7XM5CV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Schuster","credit_id":"5418b468c3a3680ac400084b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Thimig","original_name":"Hans Thimig","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/g6wjssXC0Ddzow99VZmZI08MSf8.jpg","credit_id":"5418b4140e0a2624ed000847","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0130269","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":949,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/inx0TkZ9y1MwNwzqg3jS1cDwmcg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":678}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1941-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
