Throughout the early and mid 1980s he was an addict. In this candid piece of disclosure he demonstrates a method of smoking heroin referred to as Chasing the Dragon. Drumming his fingers on the table-top while waiting for the high to take effect, heroin use is depicted as a boredom far from bliss. The work ends with Auder in a druginduced stupor, delivering a rambling proclamation about kicking the habit, ”good-bye dope, good bye monkey.”","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Last Bag of Heroin (For Real)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Auder","original_name":"Michel Auder","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/oTKuzFQapO6aojAD8OZyHvJwRMh.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"541cacc6c3a36871320005e0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Auder","original_name":"Michel Auder","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/oTKuzFQapO6aojAD8OZyHvJwRMh.jpg","credit_id":"541cacd3c3a36801cf004987","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
