For her graduation film in 1995, she visited young adults who had been in this ‘kresj’ with her. In this documentary sequel, she shifts the perspective to the parents who, with progressive insight, look back on this social experiment. The film also includes new archive footage.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Onze kresj","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365439,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marije Meerman","original_name":"Marije Meerman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"541b3fa4c3a3683841000a35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
