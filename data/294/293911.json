It's a typical worm-turns affair, as a mild-mannered provincial actor ends up working as a chauffeur for a scatterbrained female novelist. Slapstick is the order of the day, except in the scenes involving heroine Charlotte Susa. Guiding the actors through their paces was Rudolf Bernauer, a stage actor-manager of vast experience. Critics in 1931 felt that Hirsekorn Greift Ein was too thin to be stretched to 90 minutes.","popularity":0.2194,"poster_path":"/rduJhx32TWog50oxjOsHe2VMqXI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sascha-Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1931-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Excursion into Life","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Hirsekorn Butts In","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Hirsekorn greift ein","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Hirsekorn Does Something About It","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felix Bressart","original_name":"Felix Bressart","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":"/h8Ac7m2toKeDCt2VjNV7s9ytgo7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hirsekorn -
