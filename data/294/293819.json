He is caught between two families: his wife, son and mother, whom he can barely support; and his enthusiastic but disorganized guerilla dance troupe. Li's chaotic life becomes inseparable from the act of taping it, as if his experiences can only make sense on screen. Tape shatters documentary conventions, utilizing a variety of approaches, including guerilla documentary, experimental street video, even CGI. Tape captures a decade's worth of artistic aspirations and failures, while breaking new ground in individual expression in China.","popularity":0.2351,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2011-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":168,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tape","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2152895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Ning","original_name":"Li Ning","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc71da20e0a26761a00c366","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2152895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Ning","original_name":"Li Ning","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bc71e6992514136be00aff1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1865516","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":478,"name":"china"},{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Yunnan Multicultural Visual Exhibitions","release_date":"2011-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Rotterdam International Film Festival","release_date":"2011-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"MoMA Documentary Fortnight","release_date":"2011-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
