With images, narration, and a dashboard, it gives a clue to the relative size of things and what it means to add another zero to any number.  The 1977 film, Powers of Ten, was an expanded and updated version of this 1968 study film.  Charles and Ray often gave projects long titles to indicate that they were still exploring their ideas—that the presentation was a model or a type of “sketch.”","popularity":0.2203,"poster_path":"/oBHcEdepbMCGIVBImjEdX9kn1Yk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Rough Sketch for a Proposed Film Dealing with the Powers of Ten and the Relative Size of Things in the Universe","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Rough Sketch","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Rough Sketch (Powers of Ten)","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Eames","original_name":"Charles Eames","popularity":0.1759,"profile_path":"/nLh3r0QomqDHKdi1cjOwnUC8uJe.jpg","credit_id":"541ddf230e0a26124300987b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":550483,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ray Eames","original_name":"Ray Eames","popularity":0.134,"profile_path":"/jILIR1qMthTLZ93meHnnzw0vLrg.jpg","credit_id":"541ddf360e0a267feb000320","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7182,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elmer Bernstein","original_name":"Elmer Bernstein","popularity":0.4155,"profile_path":"/3617TFsk3QuDSkuXT6rle9UFcfA.jpg","credit_id":"541ddf8f0e0a260754000307","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365965,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Parke Meek","original_name":"Parke Meek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"541ddfbbc3a368720d000286","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365966,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Judith Bronowski","original_name":"Judith Bronowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"541de0120e0a267feb000346","department":"Crew","job":"Other"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0063525","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oBHcEdepbMCGIVBImjEdX9kn1Yk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":934,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7ae5mmDt1vqCqIzAj5CQ0ZUJFe9.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":624},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/x2eaOa5ez926ulPiQPMZ0NB07ji.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ROUGH SKETCH AS MODEL","key":"0u1xWwAQjio","published_at":"2013-08-01T22:46:02.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"577edf6f9251416c810017ac"}]}}}
