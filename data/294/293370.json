Joining up with her campus chums Fred (Richard Arlen) and Bob (Danny O'Shea), likewise aspiring thespians, Babes heads to Broadway with stars in her eyes. The winsome threesome are quickly disillusioned by the heartless machinations of nasty producer Renov (Paul Lukas) and his harridan wife (Lilyan Tashman). Before the plot proper gets under way, the audience is regaled with a cute \"mythological\" prologue, featuring the same three leading actors. Manhattan Cocktail was a silent picture, except for two brief musical numbers showcasing Nancy Carroll.","popularity":0.5584,"poster_path":"/1oExWan8XbqAIu5NFNt8bvaGjb5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33333,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paramount Famous Lasky
