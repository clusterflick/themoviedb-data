Having just won the hometown title of \"Miss Maple Syrup\", Hazel decides to move to Hollywood to be a star. Speedy cooks up a scheme to get her seen by important Hollywood producer, B.O. Botswaddle (Raymond Brown) who is known to never make a move without Astrological guidance. This scheme involves making up Patsy with turban and a 3rd Eye, and introducing her to Botswaddle as a mystical seer... one, of course, who see's Hazel as the star of his next motion picture. Naturally, things do not go as planned. Treen is especially memorable in a wonderfully goofy role.","popularity":0.6577,"poster_path":"/qRtTAAisfIovroih6mzYPbgkP6y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Star Is Shorn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Webb","original_name":"Danny Webb","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Speedy Williams","credit_id":"541c5c1c0e0a26123500455c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Treen","original_name":"Mary Treen","popularity":0.3902,"profile_path":"/cJWAKUmj5qP4zLfUfiYtbDQ109w.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Patsy","credit_id":"541c5c280e0a261243004577","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1233127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethelreda Leopold","original_name":"Ethelreda Leopold","popularity":0.2281,"profile_path":"/iXBiZQGxvQwTtBSacddJ0lEMTaC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hazel Hackenschmitt","credit_id":"541c5c3c0e0a261235004561","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vernon Dent","original_name":"Vernon Dent","popularity":0.1824,"profile_path":"/hIZai6jeEnoomMjlJm2bhHSQ15O.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Producer","credit_id":"5cbe4f780e0a2615fdf199cc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":129544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatrice Blinn","original_name":"Beatrice Blinn","popularity":0.066,"profile_path":"/ddO0RBDsGT2O0tS9ngZOClTf1Uq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Botswaddle's Secretary","credit_id":"5cbe4f97c3a368694c88ba55","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Del Lord","original_name":"Del Lord","popularity":0.2773,"profile_path":"/zGGlVrOKtnNXn9yxKMYkGY1yBMg.jpg","credit_id":"541c5b9cc3a36801b1003fe7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1060275,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Searle Kramer","original_name":"Searle Kramer","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"541c5bacc3a36837e6001c66","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":105735,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elwood Ullman","original_name":"Elwood Ullman","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"541c5bbac3a36801ad0042df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules White","original_name":"Jules White","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/ivf31e6sR9ZynniQocdUEHV3aKv.jpg","credit_id":"5cbe4fbac3a36813698785d4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0190037","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.604,"height":913,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qRtTAAisfIovroih6mzYPbgkP6y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":551}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":207136,"name":"two reeler"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1939-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
