Sound as it comes from a speaker has its own quality. No matter how close it comes in reproducing sound of living beings or objects, this quality is always the sound of the projector, the wires, the tubes and the speakers. This is its actuality. And it can be heard and experienced as sound, a form of energy.\" -Ernie Gehr","popularity":0.0512,"poster_path":"/hG2iHHV40eo7iae1ZUPKDBzpEw6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reverberation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1363271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Noren","original_name":"Andrew Noren","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/5cSywRjqm8jj62bfgQ6ftuuqQBL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"59c8902d925141453c00f429","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2341044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Lamarre","original_name":"Margaret Lamarre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d08a41c0e0a26317aca09ff","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085042,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ernie Gehr","original_name":"Ernie Gehr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/4H0Vs7M9LOgoXdk6vOfjUD6C7wd.jpg","credit_id":"541af780c3a3684e96001aa4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0159699","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hG2iHHV40eo7iae1ZUPKDBzpEw6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Film-Makers' Cinematheque, New York City, NY","release_date":"1969-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
