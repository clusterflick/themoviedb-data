One of them even writes her a letter that will never be sent. When the war is over Miss Delamare takes a tour in Belgium and spends a night in that castle. Most unexpectedly her former admirer appears and they dine and dance together. In the morning he has disappeared and she finds the letter. She tries to find him, only to discover he is presumably dead and involved in a family secret.","popularity":0.2838,"poster_path":"/icXgLBIRR8HnV5U7tlzJr36m1gl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tobis-Magna-Filmkunst","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1936-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das Schloß in Flandern","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":510338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mártha Eggerth","original_name":"Mártha Eggerth","popularity":0.1789,"profile_path":"/io2mTjEOlm1ydXDgbpLZL98chNm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gloria Delamare","credit_id":"541dd0950e0a260e98008c14","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Hartmann","original_name":"Paul Hartmann","popularity":0.1228,"profile_path":"/7XuDPxgxobjDzQTvwUPLcucc8YW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Fred Winsbury","credit_id":"620c964c59008600681b497d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Alexander","original_name":"Georg Alexander","popularity":0.0914,"profile_path":"/uhNaGN0dnzMitrXtJSX9eOi7x5S.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bob Harrogate","credit_id":"541dd0820e0a260754000194","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilde Weissner","original_name":"Hilde Weissner","popularity":0.1298,"profile_path":"/8kD5y1WqmlNZ53CKYGUeZGkTzyO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lady Margaret","credit_id":"620c9684706e56006a4d2869","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerti Ober","original_name":"Gerti Ober","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/ArgszUZFCYTyLf6uS6U2lMZp8Xf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"620c96a3957ce5004319dd2c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1330668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabine Peters","original_name":"Sabine Peters","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":"/44pNHTQO56ezKbWUSEePSszFYD8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Anne, Zofe bei Gloria","credit_id":"620c96c1e27260001ab96c9c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1336096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valy Arnheim","original_name":"Valy Arnheim","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/gZBA2hLeKbTZMY9knzGAJ14PMij.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gaspard -
