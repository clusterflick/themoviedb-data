Music comes from everywhere. Edited almost thirty years apart, the two Chronicles together are a study in Auder's approach to his memories. The footage is all from the same trip that was a family vacation.  Considering Chronicles/Morocco, 1971 a construct of emotional convenience unfaithful to memory, Auder decided to supplement the first version with a fuller account. The two works feature almost entirely different footage. There are, however, sections where one can see where Auder has omitted Viva. The star of the 1971 version is a young Moroccan Adonis who appoints himself tour-guide for a group of Europeans including Michel. The camera follows his charming antics as he flaunts his nubile body and rather blunt but effective skills as a hunter.","popularity":0.0639,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chronicles: Morocco","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Auder","original_name":"Michel Auder","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/oTKuzFQapO6aojAD8OZyHvJwRMh.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"541cae950e0a261e7a0005fc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":54754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viva","original_name":"Viva","popularity":0.1785,"profile_path":"/as8RgWBNvRKF6nTEd1ZcDVius7M.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"541cae9ac3a36801ad0049d1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Auder","original_name":"Michel Auder","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/oTKuzFQapO6aojAD8OZyHvJwRMh.jpg","credit_id":"541caea40e0a261235004cca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0401327","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
