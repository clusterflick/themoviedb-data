When he achieves “fame and fortune” six years later, his proud mother can’t wait to welcome him home for Thanksgiving. Robert, however, intends to stay in the city to enjoy a holiday feast with his society friends and beautiful fiancée. When Mom decides to pay a surprise visit on Thanksgiving Day, she is saddened to find that her son is so ashamed of her that he relegates her to an upstairs room, out of sight and out of mind.","popularity":0.6812,"poster_path":"/2ycKbjHGJFSEhaxRxXAZgA527An.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1910-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Mother's Thanksgiving","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Prior","original_name":"Herbert Prior","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/wN0WTT9TqPt6JvI5JsnGhp2yoMN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"6561f3163679a10976472832","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1172234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mrs. William Bechtel","original_name":"Mrs. William Bechtel","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"6561f4f1028f1400acb8f0c6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Fuller","original_name":"Mary Fuller","popularity":0.0939,"profile_path":"/7XIkKyvcJ8aEmhZNctVOjDCudMH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Fiancee","credit_id":"6561f52ca6c10400c409c79d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edwin S.
