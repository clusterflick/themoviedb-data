It's typically weird, witty and wonderful, partly due to its subject, a self-styled 'little big man' who consents to be described as 'almighty' and 'the greatest contributor to Italian cinema in the last 35 years'. The local favourite has also done time for bribery, but refuses to comment on Cosa Nostra. The film is as astonishing as its subject. Shot in luscious b/w, it's driven forward by an offscreen interrogator who alternates between ludicrously hyperbolic flattery and forthright questions about corruption and crime. It also serves as a study of the way ethics get abandoned in the unending pursuit of fame, wealth and self-esteem.","popularity":0.1391,"poster_path":"/5S23oL0n5EPMS67c4g1JmF5u7iK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tea Nova","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1999-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enzo, domani a Palermo!","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enzo Castagna","original_name":"Enzo Castagna","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5418b2a80e0a2624f40008eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salvatore Cascio","original_name":"Salvatore Cascio","popularity":0.2448,"profile_path":"/mzzCR0ihjySb96ahMUC1axvP4xW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage) (as Totò Cascio)","credit_id":"5418b2c7c3a3680ab80007cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saverio D'Amico","original_name":"Saverio D'Amico","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5418b2d9c3a3680ab4000814","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Sperandeo","original_name":"Tony Sperandeo","popularity":0.1841,"profile_path":"/ccBTr3bbio0IHVLVn6NYLJWRyZw.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5418b2f0c3a3680aaf0007da","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salvatore Termini","original_name":"Salvatore Termini","popularity":0.1965,"profile_path":"/dJj9dmHrLueWw1DRTWJn83wxWeM.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5418b303c3a3680ac0000823","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franco Maresco","original_name":"Franco Maresco","popularity":0.116,"profile_path":"/wKQ0dL6Qh0fNSDBZqhvUGaH5A4r.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"606e890a635013002c85e430","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniele Ciprì","original_name":"Daniele Ciprì","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/qYhk5jqYS8Q7v2vLmsA1gaEpvXB.jpg","credit_id":"606e88e5e04d8a0058de09ae","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniele Ciprì","original_name":"Daniele Ciprì","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/qYhk5jqYS8Q7v2vLmsA1gaEpvXB.jpg","credit_id":"5418b2110e0a2624fe000882","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franco Maresco","original_name":"Franco Maresco","popularity":0.116,"profile_path":"/wKQ0dL6Qh0fNSDBZqhvUGaH5A4r.jpg","credit_id":"5418b2250e0a2624f40008de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniele Ciprì","original_name":"Daniele Ciprì","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/qYhk5jqYS8Q7v2vLmsA1gaEpvXB.jpg","credit_id":"5418b256c3a3680ab80007bc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230350,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franco Maresco","original_name":"Franco Maresco","popularity":0.116,"profile_path":"/wKQ0dL6Qh0fNSDBZqhvUGaH5A4r.jpg","credit_id":"5418b264c3a3680ab4000804","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0210028","wikidata_id":"Q3726442","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rksJwmVvOh2Vi2xJBcxBhEnglde.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1191,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/5S23oL0n5EPMS67c4g1JmF5u7iK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":794},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/kbQKNHGEeLujqEcoAVclJcrvLom.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice Film Festival","release_date":"1999-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
