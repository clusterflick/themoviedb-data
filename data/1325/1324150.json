It is STUDIO EL founded in 1983 by Ettore Scola and Luciano Ricceri. A creative space, a sort of Renaissance workshop, a factory. A place where the two great friends prepared their great films in Cinecittà, but where they gave the opportunity to many young people to grow and improve their professionalism. After the passing of Ettore Scola and Luciano Ricceri, time at Studio E.L stopped along with many objects that are the memory of almost 40 years of history of our cinema. Before Studio EL closes forever, becoming a museum space inside Cinecittà, we would like to give the objects it contains the value they deserve and tell their stories.","popularity":0.3356,"poster_path":"/sJ3JqPQAixViYskw6w6wLWiCUxD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152962,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polygono
