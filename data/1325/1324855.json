Charles Joseph Parrott of Baltimore, Maryland started out in vaudeville during the rough and tumble days in the first decade of the 20th century. Exactly 100 years ago this year, this young man fresh off the stage, started working at the Christie Film Company. During the next decade he worked as a juvenile lead, a gag writer and a comedy director. When he changed his name to Charley Chase and found himself featured in the Hal Roach's short comedies, he became one of the great geniuses and stars of Hollywood's golden era of silent comedy. As renowned as Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd at the time, Chase easily matched them laugh for laugh.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/v4gfhWRK4BcCSKb6ku6fa6pO7Zz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":305,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Charley Chase collection to debut on DVD to celebrate his 100th anniversary in film!","title":"Cut to the Chase - The Charley Chase Comedy Collection","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v4gfhWRK4BcCSKb6ku6fa6pO7Zz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1057}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
