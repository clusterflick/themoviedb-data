The narrative unfolds through diverse more-than-human perspectives, including the Los Angeles River, wildfire, a 400-year-old sycamore named El Aliso, and the ghost of the city’s famed mountain lion, P-22. Combining history, futurism, and speculative fiction, The Alluvials examines the complex interplay between engineered ecology, disaster capitalism, and nonhuman systems shaping Los Angeles.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":"/2JmNUVKdBuI6rh0eLrQ56M2IEpd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Alluvials","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3093682,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alice Bucknell","original_name":"Alice Bucknell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ad26d8c64781606928c904","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":816,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2JmNUVKdBuI6rh0eLrQ56M2IEpd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":544}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
