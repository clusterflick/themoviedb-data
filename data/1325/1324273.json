Held annually on September 9th and 10th in Katakai Town, it features fireworks dedicated to Asahara Shrine, filled with wishes and prayers. Highlights include Japan’s largest 'San-shakudama' and the world's largest 'Yon-shakudama,' which impress spectators with their grandeur. The small hill behind the launch site amplifies the fireworks' powerful bursts.  This work condenses the festival's two-day fireworks displays. It captures the fleeting beauty of each firework, the vibrant rapid-fire starmine displays, and the grand 'San-shakudama' and 'Yon-shakudama' that fill the night sky, creating an emotional and resonant experience.  Filmed in ultra-high-definition 4K/8K60P, it faithfully reproduces the grand fireworks and fine sparks. Enjoy the immersive experience with high-resolution audio at 96kHz24bit, emphasizing the fireworks' explosive sounds and echoes.","popularity":0.1443,"poster_path":"/pOrjve53F2G749eZrxXN2hVJs2M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vicom","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2023-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echigo World’s Largest Yon-shakudama Katakai Festival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"越後 世界一 正四尺玉  片貝まつり","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Echigo World’s Largest Yon-shakudama Katakai Festival","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"越后 世界最大 正四尺玉 片贝祭","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1124,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ecDeXTJEwyiffmr39TUnUJQiOkI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/pOrjve53F2G749eZrxXN2hVJs2M.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/uoJtw1C1ZfcBhQdrLDTzfg7dxE2.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233,"name":"japan"},{"id":2407,"name":"fireworks"},{"id":268054,"name":"night"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
