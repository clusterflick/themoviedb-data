Best known for her still photographic work,  Oliver now turns her gaze to her process. Through the use of a 16mm  bolex, the artist has opened her self-portraits beyond the moment of  capture, allowing viewers into her unique process. Oliver often  meticulously pre-plans each of her shots but, because she must step out  of the frame to reset the camera between each image, it is impossible  for her to recreate each scene exactly. Viewers are brought to a better  understanding of the ephemeral nature of Oliver’s photography and the  fluidity and freedom behind her portraits.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stepping Into The Frame","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
