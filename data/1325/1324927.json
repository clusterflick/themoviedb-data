With this film, Jean Rouch continues his ethnological and cinematographic study of Songhay ritual objects. He demonstrates that, in a particular context, the transfer of a hampi vase to a museum requires the organization of a ritual ceremony to obtain the gods' approval. At the time, however, reservations about filming a possession dance for the opening of a shrine in a museum made the move \"questionable from a museological point of view\".","popularity":0.3087,"poster_path":"/yeIrwfrYQUJJ8UVH9gpLfGVhpEr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":235537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Office Nigérien du Film, I.F.A.N.
