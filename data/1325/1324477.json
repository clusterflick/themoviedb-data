The Indian start-up story, a tale of triumph and innovation, is no different—crafted and curated by those who reached the pinnacle of success. We are mesmerized by the narratives of founders, their relentless drive, and the remarkable journeys that transform ideas into empires. Yet, what remains conspicuously absent from these grand narratives are the gray areas they traverse, the compromises they make, and the actions that, at best, raise questions and, at worst, cross the lines of legality and ethics.  This documentary delves into the other side of the start-up dream: the harsh and often overlooked reality gig workers face. Through the voices of activists and organizations that fight for these workers, we uncover the nature of gig work, the gaping void in regulatory protections, and the profound apathy of ordinary citizens like you and me.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2024-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Free Market - The Dark Side of Indian Start-Up Ecosystem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Fhe Free Market - The Dark Side of Indian Start-Up Ecosystem","type":"Documentary"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1929755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kunal Kamra","original_name":"Kunal Kamra","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/l4CUIUizAFWY6H4ROeor4GtZgXa.jpg","credit_id":"66ad40c431e9e123f050a06c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nlG8gsJp3smq8DhfUxeCwyWnpfU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1zes713kPXFNg4qRIXwyhpZL9vU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
