Freely inspired by Saint-Exupéry’s fable, The Little Prince, this film tells the story of a young immigrant’s journey through the faces and wounds of Southern Italy. An attempt to reclaim his own history and perhaps his own future. But he is not alone on this journey. The narrator’s words are in fact confused with those of the many characters encountered and above all with the voice of the places crossed. The Hidden Sea is a reflection on the saving power of art.","popularity":0.1254,"poster_path":"/yH7K9FeYC8CR1IcJrXpEtWttaY2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":235393,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pseudo
