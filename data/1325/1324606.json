Sailing dangerously close to icebergs, Alecu handled his camera to record the ice masses yielding to the ruthless ocean. Filmed in black and white, Ice Breath is a cinematic poem whose only elusive actor is the filmmaker's gaze. In 43 minutes, a sequence of flat pictures turn into dynamic tableaux, an existential journey from genesis to extinction. The hypnotic feature of the film is enhanced by the soundtrack Become Ocean, a haunting composition by John Luther Adams suggestive of a relentless tidal surge, of melting polar ice and rising sea levels. Become Ocean received critical acclaim, earning the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Music and the 2015 Grammy for Best Classical Contemporary Composition. More than an environmental documentary, Ice Breath and Become Ocean is an experimental fusion exploring the vast, inscrutable meanings of climate change.","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/8Es4y8pMQwVe3vtPFQY1l06zfHA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GL","name":"Greenland"}],"release_date":"2024-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ice Breath","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4863894,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonard Gabriel Alecu","original_name":"Leonard Gabriel Alecu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ad97a731e9e123f050b619","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4863894,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leonard Gabriel Alecu","original_name":"Leonard Gabriel Alecu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aed1f4e24478488a40537a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sG7yC7ERBjqP7z3q9ss7XFCU7oI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.764,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Es4y8pMQwVe3vtPFQY1l06zfHA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":611}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
