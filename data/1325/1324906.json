When a construction on a subway line reveals material traces of the existence of the first urban quilombo recognized in the state's history, the Afro-descendant community and allies come together in an attempt to avoid yet another erasure of their history. The documentary is a portrait of the various popular resistance initiatives in one of the most diverse and culturally vibrant neighborhoods in the capital of São Paulo.","popularity":0.0795,"poster_path":"/e54VstQ08mi3kyA7h3HIxtLhZzv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79743,"logo_path":null,"name":"Olé
