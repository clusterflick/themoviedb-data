The possibility of multiplying oneself ends in a loss of subjectivity. While in this case Melhus questions the identity of the self set before a genetically-altered living situation, in his preceding works he exposed the self as being the projection surface of medial images.  Curiously on the theme of cloning a single channel video is multiplied on 8 screens.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"AGAIN AND AGAIN","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1332011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bjørn Melhus","original_name":"Bjørn Melhus","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ac2a3851213af091bd4549","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
