She talks normally, and her family is learning sign language - and she has a nutty school friend who was born deaf, and who can't talk. One day, she stumbles across a stray dog, who saves her from being run over. She wants to keep him, but her parents don't want a dog in the house. She rescues him from the pound where they send him, and comes up with the idea of having him trained as a hearing dog. This convinces her parents to allow him in the house, and she names him Ears.","popularity":0.6848,"poster_path":"/kJCAQ9AyVO9BcJ5RU2u7fRtHBIH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Big Dog...
