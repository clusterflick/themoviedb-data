This film flows from a text that inspired the ideas and  questions explored in the book, delving into Oliver's relationship with  her hair as a lens to understand her identity, lineage, and cultural  heritage.\r In  the film, the artist uses vegetable roots as symbols for split  endsâ€”those old, often hidden or trimmed parts of hair. Instead of  concealing them, the film celebrates their age, complexity, and  perseverance. The film is accompanied by a live narration from the  artist's diary.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Split Ends","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4863986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lauren Oliver","original_name":"Lauren Oliver","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66adac61b7218076cbb2c8b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
