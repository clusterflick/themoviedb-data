It's been improvised from start to finish by the amazing cast of Austentatious.  The actors conjure up the story from nothing, backed by fully improvised lighting, soundtrack and, now I come to think about it, our camerawork too.  This is the third time we have recorded Austentatious, this time as part of their residency at the Arts Theatre in London's glittering West End.","popularity":0.3671,"poster_path":"/pgl9UgrTlls2QYyI4WwepXv9Tia.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Austentatious - I Don't Think So, Sir","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1863526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Cooke-Hodgson","original_name":"Amy Cooke-Hodgson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66ae7d2d27e70e655cc05687","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Dickson","original_name":"Graham Dickson","popularity":0.1109,"profile_path":"/9C7OmSlHIFsT6D5wDzDbKmpNofQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66ae7d7a5a5e4326de00efdf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1863529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Nils Roberts","original_name":"Daniel Nils Roberts","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66ae7d8e3650778bad40efd7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1863530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Morpurgo","original_name":"Joseph Morpurgo","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66ae7d9c8637d0e8aa034997","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3154391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Shearing","original_name":"Lauren Shearing","popularity":0.0868,"profile_path":"/lHAxzDneMXGUFB8gzRmYTpbdtch.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66ae7daa59c0487eda5b14ed","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1602733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Parris","original_name":"Rachel Parris","popularity":0.2308,"profile_path":"/mnrONhz3p8lBho5gxDilTJxouQZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66ae7de05d2077575d6aad03","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4865089,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oliver Izod","original_name":"Oliver Izod","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ae7e4b5dd67663be173cc7","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ueR5NueIhYoSWZqOt8NHdd7pb6x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pgl9UgrTlls2QYyI4WwepXv9Tia.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14529,"name":"improvisation"},{"id":230318,"name":"live theatre"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
