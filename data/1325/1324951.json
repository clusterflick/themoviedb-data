A yenendi, a purification ceremony to obtain \"water from the sky but not fire from the sky\", is organized, with Sorko priests, ritual musicians and dancers, and the faithful from Niamey. The musicians call on Dongo, god of storms, and his brother Kirey, god of lightning. To the rhythm of the orchestra, a man goes into a trance, becoming Dongo's horse and at the same time the riding genie. Then a woman is possessed by Kirey. When the riding gods have mastered their horses, the gods visit the men. Dongo purifies the lightning-struck land and the oldest fisherman prepares the purification vessel, addressing Dongo.","popularity":0.2515,"poster_path":"/nAECLfeERLeSI7uLLWY3RZ9cwoU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41695,"logo_path":null,"name":"Comité du film Éthnographique","origin_country":""},{"id":13542,"logo_path":"/sJ0R9LDMGR5ildYS4GMhQcbKJVD.png","name":"CNRS Images","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":93368,"logo_path":null,"name":"S.E.R.D.D.A.V.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"NE","name":"Niger"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yenendi de Ganghel (Rain Dance at Ganghel)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Rouch","original_name":"Jean Rouch","popularity":0.2114,"profile_path":"/808sK0h9rZ5ljP2bOxyyvLmbDn7.jpg","credit_id":"66aea9ef9cf0aa725fa0c5f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3335073,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Moussa Hamidou","original_name":"Moussa Hamidou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aeaacc7a7beb574839e064","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235329,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jean-Pierre Lacam","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Lacam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aeaaefdfde21041a39e094","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4865353,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Diouldé Laya","original_name":"Diouldé Laya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aeab129f6dabe412c05784","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4865354,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fatimata Diarra","original_name":"Fatimata Diarra","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aeab241b9fd9ffd700f0b5","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":822,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nAECLfeERLeSI7uLLWY3RZ9cwoU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":548}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":209355,"name":"niger"},{"id":227593,"name":"ethnographic film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
