It is said that the name \"Posha\" comes from this.  From that day on, the Posha people began to seek their sustenance through nomadic life. Today, they continue to exist in many cities across Anatolia. This community, estimated to number between 800 and 1000 in Chankiri, earned its living primarily through trade in the marketplace known as the \"Gypsy Arasta\" (Gypsy Bazaar) and, until recently, through sifting.  Speaking a language in addition to Turkish, known as \"Posha\" or \"our language,\" gives them a distinct cultural identity. The Posha people of Chankiri are one of Anatolia's humble yet vibrant communities.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/16OA36rFPht9HiqItVpt6MdGm9T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Çankırı Poşaları","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5915605,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Turan Görgü","original_name":"Ali Turan Görgü","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69597ee820dfa93928d7948d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/16OA36rFPht9HiqItVpt6MdGm9T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
