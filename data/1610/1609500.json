A reporter for the local news, Arielle uses her information retrieved through investigative reporting to capture dangerous criminals. While her day job is journalism, her night gig is patrolling the city as the heroine Blue Swan. It's a good thing she frequently deals with the criminal element, because RB is brilliant, calculated, sociopathic and as dangerous as they come. He's compiling a long list of victims, all women, and managing to leave no clues. He's also tracking Arielle's reporting. When he finds out she's Blue Swan, he knows he needs to have her for his collection. He's done his homework and realizes he needs an edge. He hires an inside man to procure a dangerous amount of a recently banned steroid and sets a trap to inject her. Side effects include debilitating fear and reduced strength, leveling the playing field and enabling him to literally have his way. Swan is strong and isn't easily duped.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Detained","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1851408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olive Glass","original_name":"Olive Glass","popularity":5.508,"profile_path":"/skoPxwrclwV9pon2TabXGiJr7m1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Arielle","credit_id":"6959d692c4ae449928c3737e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6959d6a5ab1bc5d69acbf856","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6959d6b2b57edceaabd795b7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
