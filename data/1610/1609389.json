Isolated by depression and anxiety, Esther spends her days watching the world pass by. After a failed attempt to connect, she makes an unexpected choice: she orders a robotic dog named Luno. It's awkward. It's weird. And somehow... it helps. As Esther ventures out with Luno, a chance meeting with another robotic dog walker sparks something real. For the first time in ages, she doesn't feel invisible. Walkies is a quiet, hopeful story about taking the first steps toward connection-and discovering you're not as alone as you thought.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/xnxeJsSVwpwuGxLE7x2K8ra5A3G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239626,"logo_path":null,"name":"PiePie
