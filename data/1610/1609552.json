Documenting the production of a new video with the help of his class, Kuchar orchestrates everything from women in cages and flaming baby dolls to explosive blood splatters and ballet dancing. A high school student also happens upon the set during a visit to the college. As this bizarre spectacle begins to cohere around him, the young student watches on with equal parts amazement and perplexity. In an attempt to ease the young boy’s confusion, Kuchar offers a piece of hedonistic advice that rings true through all of his works: ‘it all goes up in smoke, so sniff it while you can.’","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"George Kuchar Goes to Work with Today's Youth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":2.8872,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6959f952b2d865bbb6cbdcb9","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0464449","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
