Alcohol becomes his only comfort—yet also his undoing. Disillusioned with life, he escapes deep into the forest, where he discovers an ancient, otherworldly notebook. Through it, Max begins a mysterious and haunting correspondence with the One who calls Himself God—and this conversation changes everything.  Is it a divine connection or a descent into madness? As Max struggles to uncover the true source of these messages, he finds himself torn between grief, faith, and the terrifying realization that his other daughter may be destined for a darker path.  Visually poetic and spiritually provocative, Letters to God blurs the line between the sacred and the psychological—a chilling mystery of faith, loss, and redemption","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/ab5tXIbfokC55qF48LGfnBXkx4h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some prayers are written, not spoken","title":"Letters to God","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5915909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatiana Alexeeva","original_name":"Tatiana Alexeeva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Clara Jane Harrison","credit_id":"6959a3d42eac872576e4139e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5915912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Koval","original_name":"Max Koval","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Max Harrison","credit_id":"6959a423cd9e311da14af74e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5915915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maya Friedman","original_name":"Maya Friedman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sophie Harrison","credit_id":"6959a4978c0019f6c07c7d68","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5915920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prosperity","original_name":"Prosperity","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Angel","credit_id":"6959a514b460c4b4eed7be87","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5915922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leona Baytukalov","original_name":"Leona Baytukalov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Emily Harrison.","credit_id":"6959a559ab1bc5d69acbf773","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5915924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alán Guzmán","original_name":"Alán Guzmán","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lucifer and devil","credit_id":"6959a596bda5cff5c04ad5b1","order":5}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2100,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ab5tXIbfokC55qF48LGfnBXkx4h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1575}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
