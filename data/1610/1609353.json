Shortly thereafter, a man makes a sexual advance toward her. Crucially, although intertitles proclaim the ensuing sex act to be coerced, Williams describes the actual footage as showing a woman who \"gives in\" to the man's advance. According to Williams, the film presents \"the classic dilemma of rape in a sexist society: the suspicion that the victim wants to be victimized.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rape in a Warehouse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":570,"name":"rape"},{"id":6217,"name":"coercion"},{"id":11534,"name":"sexual violence"},{"id":190327,"name":"sexual assault"},{"id":212652,"name":"stag film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1927-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
