Structured around a thematic cycle of birth, speed, and decay, the film uses rhythmic visuals and archival footage to bridge temporal gaps. Through a fourteen-minute mathematical edit, it replaces linguistic narrative with the evocative language of time-lapse and slow-motion cinematography. The project invites the audience to transcend chronological time and experience Istanbul as an eternal moment—an entity existing solely within its own timeless cycle.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/m2Ya5eH9vb0eV1GO7k4VB6yVTAk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A City Beyond Time: The Rhythm of the Eternal Moment.","title":"Istanbul: Chronopolis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4452286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mehmet Talha Gürel","original_name":"Mehmet Talha Gürel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695a44b61ec993c09a4af5ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4452286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mehmet Talha Gürel","original_name":"Mehmet Talha Gürel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695a44d3de508858c9cbf79f","department":"Production","job":"Post Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1551,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philip Glass","original_name":"Philip Glass","popularity":0.6017,"profile_path":"/dsf8ajHq4BJeTHdrwcM9OW72x4R.jpg","credit_id":"695a45f3b9d59305f2cbfa19","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4452286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mehmet Talha Gürel","original_name":"Mehmet Talha Gürel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695a462cca4535cfb03bd84a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m2Ya5eH9vb0eV1GO7k4VB6yVTAk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3428,"name":"speed"},{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"},{"id":282997,"name":"city"},{"id":296071,"name":"experimental documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"Genel İzleyici Kitlesi","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2026-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
