Her innate sense of right and wrong prevails and she finds herself compelled to fight crime and stand for street justice. She makes a name for herself with the locals and receives the nickname of Jungle Girl. During one of her busts, a figure in the shadows is watching her. Before she can defend herself, a chloroform cloth is on her face and the lights fade out. She wakes to find herself secured to a chair in a dark room. Her bonds are loose enough to wriggle free, but when her captor approaches, she pretends she's still restrained to figure out why she was captured. Her answers are delivered, and they correlate with flashbacks she's been experiencing. The man claims to know her well and it seems she's meddled in his affairs prior to her memory loss. When millions of dollars are on the line and her questionable memory is the only solution","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jungle Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1851408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olive Glass","original_name":"Olive Glass","popularity":5.508,"profile_path":"/skoPxwrclwV9pon2TabXGiJr7m1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jungle Girl","credit_id":"6959da77c3f78fd45d4ad512","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6959da89b9d59305f2cbf87b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3002305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Wright","original_name":"Allen Wright","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6959da9c8c0019f6c07c7e92","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
