This time, Bronson has kidnapped Almighty's long-time sidekick, friend, and information source Aticus, and is holding him captive. Without hesitation, Almighty shows up, frees the hostage, and takes care of Bronson with a couple well timed hits. While searching for the means to secure the ko'd criminal, Bronson turns the tables, awakens, and ingests a liquid form of the very source that Almighty derives her power from. With a three-year grudge, Bronson has not only had time to stoke his animosity, but has had even more time to research Almighty's every weakness. He's well prepared and poor Almighty Girl doesn't even have the slightest clue what she's about to experience...
