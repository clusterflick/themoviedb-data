After three months without communication and without her return, the woman - pregnant - faces uncertainty and loss. Unexpectedly, he receives a message from the man from the mission, assuring that he is still alive. In the outcome, the narrative takes a revealing turn: someone opens his eyes in front of a graphical interface, insinuating that everything seen has been a simulation that restarts from scratch. An intimate science fiction story that explores memory, waiting and the fragility of reality.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/AojVxGHmmpchYTTQUKdizibJTj7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":248268,"logo_path":"/1x3747jX29bmalkGnFQFqFX1LUm.png","name":"MJ Production Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terra","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5915078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maritza Amador","original_name":"Maritza Amador","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"69594036556134230fc382db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5915079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alejandro Vazquez","original_name":"Alejandro Vazquez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"69594046c26e349bf3d791b1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4059806,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gavriel Cintrón","original_name":"Gavriel Cintrón","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69594062e4d7d287f5c39e55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4059806,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gavriel Cintrón","original_name":"Gavriel Cintrón","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6959407fa41d97424f7500af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4059806,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gavriel Cintrón","original_name":"Gavriel Cintrón","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695940924e0286dddacc952d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5138626,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Manuel J.
