The play opens with Shah of Turan, Afrasiyab who is guided by the Prophet Paisgoh in an attempt to retain his throne. Raised in darkness, Sohrab is unaware of his genuine lineage and turns into a soldier looking for his father, whom he believes to be the finest of all warriors. Under Paisgoh's direction, the Shah stages a fight between the legendary Persian hero, Rustam, and his own son, Sohrab, both unaware of their relationship.  Themes of manipulation, destiny, identity, and the terrible might of war are investigated in the play. It explores the human cost of political scheming and the terrible effects of misinterpretations. With its deep emotional resonance, \"Man Hastam\" is a meditation on the inevitable clash between personal honor and the manipulative forces that drive individuals to conflict.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/xo6UNz5ekUh4Br8eA2sdIyxhjRC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":285190,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alif Adaab","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Urdu","iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A ruthless political scheme pits a legendary hero against his own son, leading to a tragic clash for power.","title":"Man Hastam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"PK","iso_639_1":"ur","file_path":"/xo6UNz5ekUh4Br8eA2sdIyxhjRC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":359246,"name":"theatre play"},{"id":365160,"name":"rustam sohrab"},{"id":365161,"name":"rustam-o-sohrab"},{"id":365162,"name":"epic tragedy"},{"id":365163,"name":"talha farrukh play"},{"id":365164,"name":"urdu theatre"},{"id":365165,"name":"urdu theater"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ur","note":"Theatre Play","release_date":"2025-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Man Hastam Teaser - Dir.
