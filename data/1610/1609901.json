Christian decided that his nieces need humbling and so he left them nothing. They must go out and get jobs immediately. Produced by Prince, the short film was created as a promotional tool for the trio, Apollonia 6. The film, which was titled either “Happy Birthday, Mr. Christian” or “Apollonia 6: the Movie,” was shot but never given a final edit – only a leaked version exists, missing sound effects, bumper music for the shot transitions, and is clearly a rough cut. The Apollonia 6 film was directed by Brian Thomson, an Aussie who did the production design for the original productions of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and the original stage show.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The lost Prince-produced short film / music video.","title":"Happy Birthday, Mr. Christian","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Apollonia 6: the Movie","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5917778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Kotero","original_name":"Patricia Kotero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Patricia Kotero","credit_id":"695ac67df4f88c6118d79aa9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1774819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brenda Bennett","original_name":"Brenda Bennett","popularity":0.1232,"profile_path":"/lKG7atCyOAf53I2gshNw7l0v4hz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Brenda Bennett","credit_id":"695ac691c702ee9a62c37c6d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1774818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Moonsie","original_name":"Susan Moonsie","popularity":0.1443,"profile_path":"/bz2rcUKGeGO5ZT16jg8gKIjwCDs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Susan Moonsie","credit_id":"695ac69e198abab033d7c755","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edy Williams","original_name":"Edy Williams","popularity":2.3058,"profile_path":"/p8jMLfwNQyDKZkitb4ZlUpe9EWr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Christian's Assistant","credit_id":"695ac6c7c55614c75ecc9766","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5917788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricky Nelson","original_name":"Ricky Nelson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mr. Christian","credit_id":"695ac6f61b00c463ffcbfab9","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606135,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Brian Thomson","original_name":"Brian Thomson","popularity":0.4813,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695ac73ec702ee9a62c37c81","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606135,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Brian Thomson","original_name":"Brian Thomson","popularity":0.4813,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695ac75fcd9e311da14afc91","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1606135,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Brian Thomson","original_name":"Brian Thomson","popularity":0.4813,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695ac76aa7a6b292907c8387","department":"Production","job":"Production Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Prince","original_name":"Prince","popularity":0.9178,"profile_path":"/5HPqjSXEQukk6ta8v1i9mPHUeqk.jpg","credit_id":"695ac779c26e349bf3d79d36","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":260553,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keith Williams","original_name":"Keith Williams","popularity":0.4524,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695ac7a23adf44cc467c83b3","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
