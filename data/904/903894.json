The movie is a journey inside this dimension, as it recounts what it means to cross this threshold and teeter between unexpected tears and sudden laughter. A reflection on old age and what you can discover by looking at yourself in this mirror, the film is the outcome of a long process of listening and dozens of lengthy encounters in five regions in Italy, in search of yesterday’s world, that sometimes seems very far away and sometimes strangely present.","popularity":0.062,"poster_path":"/zJU0DStlyFg5f5fN6G8sjfKKsK3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121333,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZaLab
