The assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, racial unrest, nationwide riots, and a continuing war in Vietnam put the nation on edge and produced a historic three-way presidential election. Through archival footage and compelling interviews, the film shows how the election was influenced by the fractures in the United States' social and political foundations, leaving deep scars that would affect generations to come.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":"/9RpvADONaP5iUvi2HbX7NO6MgKr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Community Idea Stations","origin_country":""},{"id":165191,"logo_path":null,"name":"University of Virginia Center for Politics","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ball of Confusion: The 1968 Election","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3324059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Tait Roberts","original_name":"Paul Tait Roberts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619f3d8aea7b0e002c3de243","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5735182","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9RpvADONaP5iUvi2HbX7NO6MgKr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
