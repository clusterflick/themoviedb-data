Braun Tube was recorded at a studio and salesroom operated by Toshiba, one of the largest companies that produce electronic consumer goods in Japan. Imai dims down the scale of brightness of one of the television monitors on display to the point that it begins to reflect the viewers standing in front of the TV. Imai, seated on a chair, chats with the Toshiba salesmen in suits and tie, and their reflection on the monitor is superimposed with the moving images broadcast from live television.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Braun Tube","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1306616,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Norio Imai","original_name":"Norio Imai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619eb53239a1a600427d3b54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Braun Tube｜1974, 18:21 min, sound, b&w ","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
