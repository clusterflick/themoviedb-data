In this informative new DVD, Georgia Purdom (PhD, molecular genetics) examines these arguments and shows why they are not evidence for common ancestry. Using non-technical language and illustrations, Dr. Purdom examines mitochondrial Eve, proposed human chromosome 2 fusion, ancient repetitive elements (AREs), gene duplication, and beneficial mutations to demonstrate that these “proofs” of evolution are nothing of the kind, but rather can easily be explained from a biblical worldview.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jNtYWWtdGEzgPCmH7uRRTMCaw0q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Most-Asked Questions","title":"Genetics, Evolution, and Creation","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Genetics, Evolution, and Creation: The Most-Asked Questions","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3294958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia Purdom","original_name":"Georgia Purdom","popularity":0.066,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"619efd2003bf840061028a19","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3294958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia Purdom","original_name":"Georgia Purdom","popularity":0.066,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65197c1ac50ad2010bfe3dce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3830178","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":831,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jNtYWWtdGEzgPCmH7uRRTMCaw0q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":554}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
