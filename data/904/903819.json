But this vision is impossible: it turns out to be a digital animation of a work in two interlocking pieces, the “Nesting Table” designed by Friedrich Kiesler in 1935. Now seen in reality, a group of artists gather around and contemplate it, try different poses, and compare their photo documentation with Kiesler’s. NESTING ENDLESS is an experiment in mapping, an attempt by Karl-Heinz Klopf to recapture the playfulness and provocation of the original work.
