This short film is made to raise more awareness about ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). When I saw the struggle people with autism and their relatives go through--every day--I realized: if only people would be able to take a look inside the world of someone with autism, if only people would understand a little of what it really means for them, many judgments and dismissive actions towards people with autism, can be turned into motivating and stimulating actions. Understanding is the key for a change of behavior. It is my hope this film will create more of this understanding.","popularity":0.3608,"poster_path":"/AfmqND355Qpab0bQZU42tnHOxaz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One boy - One toy - One battle.","title":"On Dragon's Wings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1099916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Beckham","original_name":"Andrew Beckham","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":39,"character":"Zachary","credit_id":"619e63178de0ae006331c09e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":225366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karla Droege","original_name":"Karla Droege","popularity":0.1359,"profile_path":"/zQIt2uZNjVE5B4mHjVVDhdh4a57.jpg","cast_id":40,"character":"Frederique","credit_id":"619e6359c0ae36002b6750d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3323179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Noonan II","original_name":"Jack Noonan II","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":41,"character":"Peter","credit_id":"619e636466362700448bd7b8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1607790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia T.
