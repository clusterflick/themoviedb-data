She left a legacy of sin and despair that affects our parenting and marriages even today.  But Eve has another legacy – through her seed came Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of man. Understanding Eve and how God worked in and through her gives us hope for today. In this presentation by Dr. Purdom, you will truly understand the life and legacies of Eve. You’ll discover that where sorrow and despair abound, God’s love and mercy abound still more, and lead us to a life marked by hope in the Creator whose Word is true and who keeps His promises.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hA1sK64N5qke3za1arT0amg79E8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Legacy of Eve","title":"Hope Amid Despair","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Hope Amid Despair: The Legacy of Eve","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3294958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia Purdom","original_name":"Georgia Purdom","popularity":0.066,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"619f082fc0ae360062201b45","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3294958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia Purdom","original_name":"Georgia Purdom","popularity":0.066,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6519775b9d592c0142612237","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3294958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia Purdom","original_name":"Georgia Purdom","popularity":0.066,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"651977569d592c0142612233","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3828196","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hA1sK64N5qke3za1arT0amg79E8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":564}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
