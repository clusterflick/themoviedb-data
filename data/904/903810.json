This is especially obvious in children. Most of their questions are pretty easy. But what about the questions that can stump even mom & dad?  What happened to the dinosaurs?  Why did grandpa have to die?  Where did we come from?  Did God really create the world or did it evolve?  Could aliens be real?  Kids today are bombarded with false information from TV, the internet, school, movies, and books about the past. As Christians, we need to give them the true answers from God's Word (beginning in Genesis) and show them how science confirms the Bible’s truth.  In this new video, Dr. Georgia Purdom reveals simple, Bible-based answers that parents can use with children of all ages!","popularity":0.2557,"poster_path":"/cXTEfZJcBty7d8Xyh1Iu413cTZX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"...about Science & the Bible","title":"Kids’ Most-asked Questions","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3294958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia Purdom","original_name":"Georgia Purdom","popularity":0.066,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61a03cc27f1d83002d73aeec","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3294958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia Purdom","original_name":"Georgia Purdom","popularity":0.066,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65197210072166011c018a8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":830,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cXTEfZJcBty7d8Xyh1Iu413cTZX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":553}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":231099,"name":"religious propaganda"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
