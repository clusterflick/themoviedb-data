The story centres on Tevye, the father of five daughters, and his attempts to maintain his Jewish religious and cultural traditions as outside influences encroach upon the family's lives. He must cope both with the strong-willed actions of his three older daughters, who wish to marry for love (each one's choice of a husband moves further away from the customs of their Jewish faith and heritage) and with the edict of the Tsar that evicts the Jews from their village.","popularity":0.1182,"poster_path":"/8qyUd0Z4UFeE1sMrneaXs07Jdlq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":148,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fiddler on the Roof","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3322533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douwe Bijkersma","original_name":"Douwe Bijkersma","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tevye","credit_id":"619dc758528b2e008b3af44a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3322534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riana van Vollenhoven","original_name":"Riana van Vollenhoven","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Golde","credit_id":"619dc76863536a00619c64aa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3322535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kay Dewes","original_name":"Kay Dewes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tzeitel","credit_id":"619dc77838469a00438f976e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3322536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Botha-Spies","original_name":"Marina Botha-Spies","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Hodel","credit_id":"619dc78266362700627a21f3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3322537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noelien Wilsnach","original_name":"Noelien Wilsnach","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Chava","credit_id":"619dc79052dc7f00873ce763","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3322538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephan Gericke","original_name":"Stephan Gericke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Motel","credit_id":"619dc79bc0ae360089166209","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3322539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Thornhill","original_name":"Peter Thornhill","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Perchik","credit_id":"619dc7a9c4f5520093a57e0a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3307821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manie Kohn","original_name":"Manie Kohn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Fyedka","credit_id":"619dc815c4f5520093a57ea4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3322540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bevan Timm","original_name":"Bevan Timm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Constable","credit_id":"619dc824a410c80090abca29","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3322541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tinus Spies","original_name":"Tinus Spies","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Lazar Wolf","credit_id":"619dc832c0ae360044fc1a30","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3322542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie McCrea","original_name":"Marie McCrea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Yente","credit_id":"619dc84163536a0043a5afc4","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3322532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus-Louis Jansen van Vuuren","original_name":"Klaus-Louis Jansen van Vuuren","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619dc6fca22d3e0043c2078a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450609,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sheldon Harnick","original_name":"Sheldon Harnick","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/uh4JuVixNaOXhsmEpscYz0RirtD.jpg","credit_id":"64279fc2e2ff3200f23455eb","department":"Writing","job":"Lyricist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1318751,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jerry Bock","original_name":"Jerry Bock","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64279fba35811d00779754f2","department":"Sound","job":"Songs"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1419,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8qyUd0Z4UFeE1sMrneaXs07Jdlq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":946}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
