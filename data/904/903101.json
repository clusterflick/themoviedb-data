To illustrate this basic truth, thirty-three animators each introduce a character who eats the one previously introduced and is eaten by the next animator's creation. It happens on land and at sea, with humans, animals real and imaginary, aliens, a few plants, and a robot. They are chomped whole, sliced, smashed, flattened, inhaled through straws, eaten from the inside out and the backside forward. Sometimes the little guy wins; nothing and no one is invincible. By the end, we've come full circle.","popularity":0.2532,"poster_path":"/uTSj8NDbD7vwclYSuGkH7Keq6q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-11-12","revenue":9692,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film by Mo Willems","title":"Life","video":false,"vote_average":8.6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224841,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mo Willems","original_name":"Mo Willems","popularity":0.1389,"profile_path":"/f6Nbn3S09ecJ5SYJSnUXvVkP9xR.jpg","credit_id":"619db533a410c800654c2633","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0265283","wikidata_id":"Q19880783","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1916,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uTSj8NDbD7vwclYSuGkH7Keq6q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1999-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
