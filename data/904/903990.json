The short film follows a young woman of Asian descent fulfilling the expectation of Western society. Slowly, she begins to question whether her actions are simply the result of how she has been conditioned to think and whether ultimately after so many years this has effectively become her identity. Challenging how truly comfortable we feel in our skin, Mantis cleverly poses the question of who's in charge of (de)constructing our identity.","popularity":0.0577,"poster_path":"/dxDn6d1oVnbOabvtbadiJNGBwJx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mantis, Fashion Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Grabuleda Capdevila","original_name":"Albert Grabuleda Capdevila","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a12c5b134d58006251779a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15341050","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dxDn6d1oVnbOabvtbadiJNGBwJx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
