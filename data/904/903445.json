Poems that sing and evoke the essence of Bedouin material culture linked to the movement from Saquia el Hamra to Rio de Oro. A magical journey from the Draa River in the north to Agüenit and Leyuad on the southern border with Mauritania, from the coast with the white beaches of Bojador up to the vague boundaries of the Badia. A Saharawi national territory marked by the trace of the recent history of revolution, war, resistance (intifada) and waiting. Territory, history, culture, basted from poetry full of life, love and nostalgia.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/82j4pEzCIvjbhp9MXb06DSNNQvk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2014-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Speaks the Sahrawi verse.","title":"Legna","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3323599,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Ignacio Robles","original_name":"Juan Ignacio Robles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619ec2c2c0ae360044fd6795","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3323601,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Juan Carlos Gimeno","original_name":"Juan Carlos Gimeno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619ec2d431032500436c6cbb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3323602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bahia Awah","original_name":"Bahia Awah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619ec30503bf84002c563cf0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3323601,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Juan Carlos Gimeno","original_name":"Juan Carlos Gimeno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619ec315bc2cb30042854ffc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3323599,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Ignacio Robles","original_name":"Juan Ignacio Robles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619ec3273103250021738838","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12753346","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":819,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/82j4pEzCIvjbhp9MXb06DSNNQvk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":577}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"APTA","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer - Legna","key":"t8EuZGOgGbI","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-05-21T20:39:57.000Z","id":"619ecb1a35db45008b1d958b"}]}}}
