The Tuschinski Theater of Amsterdam was born from a foolish dream; the one of Abraham Icek Tuschinski who has left his shtetl from Poland, and settles in Rotterdam where he opens a canteen to welcome Jewish immigrants. He then opens three little cinema halls that become a fast success and that’s how he decides to built a real cathedral like cinema hall.  Real Art Deco palace inaugurated in October 1920, the Tuschinski encounters a meteoric success. During 20 years of a brilliant activity and despite the rise of intolerance in the Netherlands, Abraham Tuschinski believes in his dream.  And, though weakened by financial difficulties, Tuschinski will never give up his dream. It will be the Nazis, invading the Netherlands, organizing the deporting of Jews and despoiling the properties, that will make Tuschinski’s dream turning into a nightmare.","popularity":0.1806,"poster_path":"/d5lNIqrfoOQF1ifU3mLsm809Hu7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112963,"logo_path":"/ccSxSr2Kgdt6jzAjHHvDn8K3xKD.png","name":"Kolam Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tuschinski's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max von Sydow","original_name":"Max von Sydow","popularity":1.4935,"profile_path":"/u16BsGyT6v9yuO7wWAF62NayDth.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"619e42a4a410c800654cc77f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Braoudé","original_name":"Patrick Braoudé","popularity":0.147,"profile_path":"/hzQqtP04qdnpFJ3qZSmkCJZPSSA.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"619e456135db45002c5348d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32504,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Béatrice Thiriet","original_name":"Béatrice Thiriet","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"619e4566a410c800441946e5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2428501,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olga Prud’homme Farges","original_name":"Olga Prud’homme Farges","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e42fcc0ae360044fc7bf6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":544395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jérôme Diamant-Berger","original_name":"Jérôme Diamant-Berger","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e42b8a410c800654cc789","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3322873,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Guillaume Diamant-Berger","original_name":"Guillaume Diamant-Berger","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e42cf66362700448ba3b8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":544395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jérôme Diamant-Berger","original_name":"Jérôme Diamant-Berger","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e42c05e12000043db0f3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32504,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Béatrice Thiriet","original_name":"Béatrice Thiriet","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e42e766362700448ba3e2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1832,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d5lNIqrfoOQF1ifU3mLsm809Hu7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
