This project portrays accounts of displacement rooted in the experience of migrants through sound and movement. By incorporating dance as an expressive act of transformability, this video illustrates the emotional landscape of displacement using corporal acts. This work moves beyond the visible to tell the story of an invisible city, a seamless tale about a place that exists within every displaced person and beyond physical location.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/duMKugYK0ofVQ5049ArmhD4aD5T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Can Only Dance To One Song","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3323376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arash Fayez","original_name":"Arash Fayez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e955c35db450062e89a3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":901,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/duMKugYK0ofVQ5049ArmhD4aD5T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
