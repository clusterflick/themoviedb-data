Kühn’s diary film is constructed from a series of snapshots and stolen moments of intimacy between a man and a woman, a relationship threatened by the hardships of mental illness, the fragility of love, and the desire to leave and the desire to stay. Is it the end or only the beginning? Delicately weaving in and out of different emotional registers, the camera itself becomes a kind of protective tool that simultaneously shields against the pain of living and opens up a space for self-reflection.
