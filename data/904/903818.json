Some have claimed that a physician who rejects the idea of evolution will make bad clinical decisions. Is there a basis for this claim?  In this important video, Dr. Tommy Mitchell, a practicing internist for over 20 years, clearly shows that belief in evolution is not necessary for the proper practice of medicine. Dr. Mitchell discusses various topics including antibiotic resistance, vestigial organs, the origin of germs, and euthanasia.
