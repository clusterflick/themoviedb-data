Viewers will understand that the issue is not science vs. religion but anti-Christian ideas vs. the clear teaching of Scripture.  With a summary of some of the many godly Christian leaders over the past 150 years who have compromised with millions of years, Dr. Mortenson gives a critically needed historical context for understanding why the authority of Scripture is so undermined in the Church today and how this relates to the proclamation of the gospel. Great for teens and adults, especially pastors.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/nvTPR6Z3WpiMxWWCUucN4MVjYGC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84020,"logo_path":null,"name":"Answers in Genesis","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Millions of Years: Where Did the Idea Come From?","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1877709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Terry Mortenson","original_name":"Dr. Terry Mortenson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"61a0418aed28b90091ec17fc","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":831,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hYbjokLfPNjhrSc1iCTNVxH8bbH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":554},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nvTPR6Z3WpiMxWWCUucN4MVjYGC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DVD","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
