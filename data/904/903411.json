It examines cultural production, public space and the collective imaginary through the prism of the ghost, understood as an echo of silenced voices and historical facts. Developed with Moroccan and Spanish cultural agents, the project explores narrative strategies to resignify places such as the Plaça Tetuan in Barcelona, the neighborhood of Tetuán de las Victorias in Madrid or the cinema “Español” in the proper city of Tetwan, Morroco.","popularity":0.0906,"poster_path":"/8IAIf6AedRL0P9ibPxE8pZvKaQZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157920,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lejos Lejos","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tetuan, Tetuán, Tetwan (Primera parte)","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1681449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ali el Aziz","original_name":"Ali El Aziz","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/tZo16ttyGpfbh4sICY8G0dExmQY.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"619e9ee639a1a600649d3f82","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3323410,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Salma Amzian","original_name":"Salma Amzian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"619e9ef38efe730066a5612b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3323416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rita El Jebari","original_name":"Rita El Jebari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"619e9f0052dc7f0062b6b050","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdel Aziz El Mountassir","original_name":"Abdel Aziz El Mountassir","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"619e9f0c66362700448c4f1f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3323417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Itzea Goikolea-Amiano","original_name":"Itzea Goikolea-Amiano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"619e9f17b4a543002d5efb8f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2978323,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pablo Paloma","original_name":"Pablo Paloma","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e9dd331032500436c22a5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1302359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caterina Monzani","original_name":"Caterina Monzani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e9e395e12000043dbb56b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2345853,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Clara Rus","original_name":"Clara Rus","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e9e4b35db450062e8aaf5","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3323415,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Heidi Ramírez","original_name":"Heidi Ramírez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e9e7869d2800060ed3828","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2375963,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bruno Carbonetto","original_name":"Bruno Carbonetto","popularity":0.623,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619e9e64e2ff3200659a636a","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3323411,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hamid E.
