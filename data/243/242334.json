The film examines the connection between hunter and prey and obsession in the face of extinction. It posits the question 'what would happen to someone at the tipping point; the moment where they are directly responsible for the extinction of an entire species'  Duck hunting in Australia is a very contentious issue and every year hunters and protesters clash.  The experimental side is evidenced with the lack of dialog, non-linear narrative and a 'score' by Belgian sound designer Christina Clar. The majority of the sound tracking and design was completed before the edit in Australia, thus reversing the usual process. The sound post production was completed in Brussels and includes recordings from deep within remote caves.","popularity":0.0541,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Automata","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277347,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christina Clar","original_name":"Christina Clar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"52fe4ecac3a36847f82a8093","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":967154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom McCathie","original_name":"Tom McCathie","popularity":0.3642,"profile_path":"/1Goj4BYLhImy6GW9uqxOm48mGQ3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ecac3a36847f82a8097","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Wilks","original_name":"Sarah Wilks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"52fe4ecac3a36847f82a809b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":167134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Richards","original_name":"Matthew Richards","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/qAvwdCCfcClsVUxQEOPlhwyUkVm.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ecac3a36847f82a808f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":167134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Richards","original_name":"Matthew Richards","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/qAvwdCCfcClsVUxQEOPlhwyUkVm.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ecac3a36847f82a8089","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2049394","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
