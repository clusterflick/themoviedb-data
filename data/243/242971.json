She worries about him and knows that his lack of engagement is not emotionally healthy. When he dies after a few years of retirement, she gives up her home and goes to live with her daughter's family, which also presents challenges. The woman reflects on how to manage these life changes, and how to continue to live a rewarding, engaged life. She seeks a job but is turned away, apparently because the dress shop that is hiring prefers someone younger. She has some disagreements with her daughter about child-rearing. Ultimately, she and her daughter both conclude that they must show more respect and appreciation for one another.","popularity":0.0981,"poster_path":"/9vtZNz6OvR2FYjODuhxUd7lkSCT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94018,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Documents","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Steps of Age","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Stairs","type":"New Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose Spencer","original_name":"Rose Spencer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mrs. Potter","credit_id":"602551fbdd25890040bff934","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harvard Sylvia","original_name":"Harvard Sylvia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mr. Potter","credit_id":"60255221498ef9003ff784be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973556,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Agee","original_name":"Emma Agee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Their daughter","credit_id":"60255253af58cb0040a4a3eb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manny Kirschner","original_name":"Manny Kirschner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Her husband","credit_id":"60255288dd25890040bff9b6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dimitra Sundeen","original_name":"Dimitra Sundeen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"The grandmother","credit_id":"602552ce6a3448003e13067d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gretchen Mohegan","original_name":"Gretchen Mohegan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The child on the stairs","credit_id":"60255340dcf875003e382f67","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2973563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgia Tolliver","original_name":"Georgia Tolliver","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Saleslady","credit_id":"6025537d498ef9003ff786c0","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1128330,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Helen Levitt","original_name":"Helen Levitt","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634dd43eec0c58007c15a63a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3416950,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"George Jacobson","original_name":"George Jacobson","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634dd49412eb890082c5620f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143163,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sidney Meyers","original_name":"Sidney Meyers","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/ncbOwrGlxV4i7NL4CWFugUVTMwU.jpg","credit_id":"634dd4a39af171007a8ff24f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2449981,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Max Glenn","original_name":"Max Glenn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cf4e42fdf8b7018667a713","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3349937,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lawrence Mezey","original_name":"Lawrence Mezey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65cf4e2bfdf8b7018667a6ec","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50961,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Maddow","original_name":"Ben Maddow","popularity":0.2338,"profile_path":"/smg91alJryB5z0hojMSRHpTrn0M.jpg","credit_id":"5d76a072efca000011dd6009","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50961,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Maddow","original_name":"Ben Maddow","popularity":0.2338,"profile_path":"/smg91alJryB5z0hojMSRHpTrn0M.jpg","credit_id":"6027be1b0fb3980041c969b0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0042996","wikidata_id":"Q7766190","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9vtZNz6OvR2FYjODuhxUd7lkSCT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
