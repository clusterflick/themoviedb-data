When a decree is issued that no more Americans may enter Texas, William H. Wharton, fiery head of a faction determined on independence or nothing, warns Stephen F. Austin that the time for half-measures is past. Austin, responsible for bringing the Americans to Texas as colonists, reminds Wharton that a settler's revolt against Mexico would dishonor his name and the arrangements he had with the Mexican government. He gets the \"Whartonites\" to agree to a general convention of all colonists. Almerian Dickinson, biggest land owner in the settlement of Gonzales, deeply in love with his wife Anne, warns Wharton that a bloody revolt would endanger every wife and mother in the colony. He proposes they send Austin to Mexico City to ask Santa Anna to grant Texans a voice in their own government.","popularity":0.7871,"poster_path":"/kM5jVuI4jzQfXfpt68SkPVUwi6M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4697,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunset Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"To The Last Man...They Defended Texas Liberty!","title":"Heroes of the Alamo","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earle Hodgins","original_name":"Earle Hodgins","popularity":0.2293,"profile_path":"/tdoaxQUuE9Ko5PtQsrqDXdFIJpU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Stephen F.
