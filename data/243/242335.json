And, then, he finds a thousand dollar bill. His honesty makes him advertise the find, but no one claims the money. When he is convinced that the owner will not turn up and that the money is his to keep, he becomes a changed, more aggressive and self-confident person. He begins to make sales as fast as he can make the pitch and he insists that he and Molly be married at once. While getting dressed for the ceremony, he places the $1000 bill in one of his father's old suits, and Pa Armstrong, trying to raise money to buy his son a wedding present, sells the suit to a passing junk man.","popularity":0.3531,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1937-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small Town Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Erwin","original_name":"Stuart Erwin","popularity":0.8025,"profile_path":"/yO5OCvQmwUsi0WS7kbDUvYCMHQi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Henry Armstrong","credit_id":"52fe4ecac3a36847f82a80c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce Compton","original_name":"Joyce Compton","popularity":0.4196,"profile_path":"/z5rRRN40OSWX1G5i5edvfqe56wv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Molly Summers","credit_id":"52fe4ecac3a36847f82a80c9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jed Prouty","original_name":"Jed Prouty","popularity":0.1636,"profile_path":"/cRB15sXHs5HETFBn7WWK6dSyhXa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Otis Armstrong","credit_id":"52fe4ecac3a36847f82a80cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Blandick","original_name":"Clara Blandick","popularity":0.3632,"profile_path":"/1V1QarPPNpJak9WKuF4RzmtiasW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Armstrong","credit_id":"52fe4ecac3a36847f82a80d1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1062775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Appleby","original_name":"Dorothy Appleby","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/2SVGTgv49KS1XpzkW1u5DRNSBuh.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sandra French","credit_id":"52fe4ecac3a36847f82a80d5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1104353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Blakeley","original_name":"James Blakeley","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":"/tPPlYVPN35wmY41N8HlNN2USCuH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Eddie Armstrong","credit_id":"52fe4ecac3a36847f82a80d9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Wilson","original_name":"Clarence Wilson","popularity":0.2187,"profile_path":"/zi37Pkxd7IsNFjgdbbkK8apgtmr.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Curtis French","credit_id":"52fe4ecac3a36847f82a80dd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1021841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John T.
