The part of a woman's body where she is probably the most vulnerable, beautiful, proud and sexy becomes a source of despair and rage. For Ingrid, Vicky and Sabrina, breast cancer takes on various forms. They are working towards recovery through tough and painful treatment, but are acutely aware that the disease can rear its ugly head again without warning. They feel damaged and insecure, and their self-esteem is at stake, for the disease has eroded their sense of femininity. In a very personal and intimate way, Awake in a Bad Dream shows how the women and their partners try to regain control of their lives after the diagnosis. Without comment or interviews, the film follows Ingrid, Vicky and Sabrina as they face inevitable and painful choices at the hospital.","popularity":0.2943,"poster_path":"/mvhGPCzmCuSIY2488HgNWHXHxsL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54746,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lataster & Films","origin_country":""},{"id":48572,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boeddhistische Omroep Stichting","origin_country":""},{"id":54747,"logo_path":null,"name":"Human","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2013-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Awake in a Bad Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277251,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petra Lataster-Czisch","original_name":"Petra Lataster-Czisch","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ec8c3a36847f82a77d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Lataster","original_name":"Peter Lataster","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ec8c3a36847f82a77dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Lataster","original_name":"Peter Lataster","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"556f1d12925141086f0000bb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277251,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petra Lataster-Czisch","original_name":"Petra Lataster-Czisch","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"556f1d2a925141085e000102","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3445010","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/mvhGPCzmCuSIY2488HgNWHXHxsL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8496,"name":"breast cancer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
