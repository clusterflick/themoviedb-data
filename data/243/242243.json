In this short film we follow one of Iceland´s best known photographers, Ragnar Th. Sigurdsson, on his chase of the Northern lights. He takes photographers from all over the world on photograpic tours, tells us how to film the lights and in between we see fabulous shots of the lights - as well as graphic explainations of their existence and chance of appearance.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chasing the Northern Lights","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valdimar Leifsson","original_name":"Valdimar Leifsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ec7c3a36847f82a76c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
