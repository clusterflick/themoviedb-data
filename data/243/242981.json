A former LA police officer, Kritzman was under heavy sedation due to the severity of his leg injury, which was initially operated on at the 8055 MASH unit. Unaware of what would happen to him and what his long term prognosis was and would be, he, along with many of his fellow wounded, was transferred from hospital to hospital, each a little better equipped to deal with his injury. However, his ultimate goal was to make it back home to his wife and son, from who his thoughts were never far.","popularity":0.2114,"poster_path":"/ep8UvEsZFvj70enFAaxcWKPfhKU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Who Came Back","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3214819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Kritzman","original_name":"George Kritzman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6129efa606f9840063710e8d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3214820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Jane Kritzman","original_name":"Mary Jane Kritzman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6129efb90d9f5a00626bbf54","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3214821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richie Kritzman","original_name":"Richie Kritzman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6129efda74d6c0002ac4029d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040086,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Owen Crump","original_name":"Owen Crump","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6129ef2a5ed9620065347e13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1040086,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Owen Crump","original_name":"Owen Crump","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6129ef395ed96200266e8756","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3214817,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Charles Welbourne","original_name":"Charles Welbourne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6129ef53e8a3e1008cf9c309","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2697908,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jack Kampschroer","original_name":"Jack Kampschroer","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6129ef6912197e0061922463","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7647,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mikl贸s R贸zsa","original_name":"Mikl贸s R贸zsa","popularity":0.1405,"profile_path":"/zvIVRP9H2SnznXIYqFIvSJwUo21.jpg","credit_id":"6129ef7d42f19f009577edf6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0043883","wikidata_id":"Q7093376","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ep8UvEsZFvj70enFAaxcWKPfhKU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
