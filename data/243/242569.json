He then ate her. Several months later he was declared insane. While in a psychiatric hospital in France he wrote an account of his crime `In the Fog' which sold 200,000 copies. The French released him in 1984 on the condition that he remained in a mental hospital in Japan. One year later the Japanese hospital released him. Since then he has written five books on crime and is a minor celebrity lionised by the avant garde. Sagawa speaks extensively in the programme and reads passages from his books.","popularity":0.1445,"poster_path":"/wO6VKMlVHSW6t9DHUW1cGLFfbsH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6705,"logo_path":"/iNB1FCwT4XjO6wkN3PnpPnwr9GX.png","name":"Film4 Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1993-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Issei Sagawa: Excuse Me For Living","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Issei Sagawa","original_name":"佐川一政","popularity":0.3603,"profile_path":"/2GSVWy8O3mbWhO34izyXNByG23i.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"595956a2c3a36825e8027810","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":71030,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Colin Wilson","original_name":"Colin Wilson","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5ab600890e0a261ff1005cd2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1855555,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Suguru Kubota","original_name":"Suguru Kubota","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ab600b50e0a261fee00581d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tetsuo Amano","original_name":"Tetsuo Amano","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ab600ec925141395500564b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4497770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Hartevelt","original_name":"Renée Hartevelt","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"65b13f042fe2fa01503ccaee","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4497771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Marchetli","original_name":"Bernard Marchetli","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65b13f162790bf01515626ac","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshi Tezuka","original_name":"Yoshi Tezuka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ed0c3a36847f82a9a2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277703,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nigel Evans","original_name":"Nigel Evans","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ed0c3a36847f82a9a27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277703,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nigel Evans","original_name":"Nigel Evans","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ed0c3a36847f82a9a33","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277703,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nigel Evans","original_name":"Nigel Evans","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9a598c0e0a2671e1c23721","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2274543,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Krystyna Pobóg-Malinowska","original_name":"Krystyna Pobóg-Malinowska","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9a5907c3a36873193c9cb3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8185006","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wO6VKMlVHSW6t9DHUW1cGLFfbsH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Issei Sagawa - Excuse Me For Living (1993)","key":"jyqtpvlFFtU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2021-06-16T21:54:10.000Z","id":"65b13f5b2fe2fa01723cf94c"}]}}}
