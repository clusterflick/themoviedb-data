This is a Grantland Rice Sportscope from Paramount about hobbyists building steam locomotives, scaled one inch to the foot, by members of the Southern California branch of the Live Steam Model Locomotives Club. The models are powerful enough for the hobbyists to ride over the expensive-and-expansive tracks they also build to scale. Many of these models are perfect working replicas of of the locomotives used on the United States railway system. This short features Walt Disney, one of the experts on model-train building, working on his scaled-down 'Diamond Slacker\", and taking kids to ride on his elaborate miniature system. The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Short Subject, One-Reel.","popularity":0.1345,"poster_path":"/oV8KgghSc23XVrpevkfesW5N4Rv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ridin' the Rails","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1149815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Husing","original_name":"Ted Husing","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Commentator","credit_id":"5d879b355a469000199cf487","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hobbyist / Model Train Builder","credit_id":"5d879b44172d7f001749462d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157557,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Eaton","original_name":"Jack Eaton","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d879ae0223e200029732f3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1149815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Husing","original_name":"Ted Husing","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d879b26b76cbb0017e20208","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0043969","wikidata_id":"Q22336707","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oV8KgghSc23XVrpevkfesW5N4Rv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xE6FQHFlxXlhma537uBsUnEx9HN.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
