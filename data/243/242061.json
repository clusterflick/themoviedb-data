Bob, Don and Bob's buddies, Muggsy and Bilgey, go to a caf√© and there Don falls for Nina, a singer in love with Bob. Bob doesn't know this and thinks she is Garccia's girl, and warns Don to have nothing to do with her. Don disregards the warning and Garcia discovers Nina and Don together and provokes Don into hitting him. Don is arrested and thrown into the company brig. Nina, with the aid of an Arabian sheik, Ul Ahmed, helps Don escape. Bob, Muggsy and Bilgey follow but are captured and taken to Ul Hamid's headquarters. The sheik tortures Don to force Bob to work some captured machine guns for him. Ah Hamid and his tribe attack the fort, but Bob manages to turn the machine guns against his captors, and the fort is saved.","popularity":0.7435,"poster_path":"/fZTR7OuUXHgZBx0I3akxmFPkW7l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monogram Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Legion of Missing Men","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Forbes","original_name":"Ralph Forbes","popularity":0.2961,"profile_path":"/kSZ7qzRsQKLlLrNzvwwfsEWZc8B.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bob Carter","credit_id":"52fe4ec3c3a36847f82a68a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Alexander","original_name":"Ben Alexander","popularity":0.2743,"profile_path":"/9rei98OSExqKecusqft2BV5KR1X.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Don Carter","credit_id":"52fe4ec3c3a36847f82a68a5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hala Linda","original_name":"Hala Linda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nina De Bernay","credit_id":"52fe4ec3c3a36847f82a68a9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy D'Arcy","original_name":"Roy D'Arcy","popularity":0.1139,"profile_path":"/Qmk3Mn9lqGsL7scAyQgICNf6sS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Shiek Ibrahim-Ul-Ahmed","credit_id":"52fe4ec3c3a36847f82a68ad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Hurst","original_name":"Paul Hurst","popularity":0.3319,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Muggsy","credit_id":"52fe4ec3c3a36847f82a68b1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Aubrey","original_name":"Jimmy Aubrey","popularity":0.1456,"profile_path":"/u3v4qfimtESXD71mVAs6Jtk8pLS.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bilgey","credit_id":"52fe4ec3c3a36847f82a68b5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Regas","original_name":"George Regas","popularity":0.1426,"profile_path":"/AfHbRzoxSF0LtRNTtdOWPNNKYh.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sergeant Garcia","credit_id":"52fe4ec3c3a36847f82a68b9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1013178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Leigh","original_name":"Frank Leigh","popularity":0.2182,"profile_path":"/jUCNJGDcHgU7O2LMNMZdTVnv3IR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Colonel Laurant","credit_id":"52fe4ec3c3a36847f82a68bd","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hamilton MacFadden","original_name":"Hamilton MacFadden","popularity":0.2117,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ec3c3a36847f82a689d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1347788,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"I.E.
