The end of World War II led to the return of many Americans to their pre-war livelihoods--including Detroit Tigers starter Virgil Trucks.  Aided by Trucks, along with American League MVP速 Hal Newhouser, the Tigers won in seven games in 1945.  The Tigers' 1968 season was dominated by pitching, and the World Series showcased three of the best: Denny McClain and Mickey Lolich of the Tigers and Cardinals速' Ace Bob Gibson. Lolich took control of the series with three complete-game wins as the Tigers beat the Cardinals in seven games. Coach Sparky Anderson led the Tigers to a record-setting start of the 1984 season culminating with 104 regular season wins, a sweep of the ALCS速, and a World Series win. Jack Morris, Alan Trammell, and Kirk Gibson set the pace as the Tigers became only the third MLB 速 club to go wire-to-wire.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/bCYjeafijnNiGUmUcP1T3vsFikZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MLB Vintage World Series Films - Detroit Tigers (1945, 1968, 1984)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bCYjeafijnNiGUmUcP1T3vsFikZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
