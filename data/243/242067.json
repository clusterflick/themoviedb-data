Hirliman-produced films starring George O'Brien (preceded by \"Daniel Boone\", \"Park Avenue Logger\" and \"Hollywood Cowboy\") that were distributed by RKO Radio. Hirliman sold O'Brien's contract to RKO, which then produced 18 series westerns starring O'Brien that ended when O'Brien went into the Navy at the outbreak of WW II. Long-time (past and future) O'Brien director David Howard served as Hirliman's Associate Producer on this film. \"Windjammer\" finds O'Brien as a subpoena server ordered to serve a subpoena on Brandon Evans (The Commondore) for a senate inquiry or lose his job. Posing as a playboy, he boards the Commodore's yacht during a yacht race, and the yacht is wrecked by a gun-running windjammer commanded by Captain Morgan (William Hall.) All hands are picked up by the windjammer, including the Commodore's daughter (played by Constance Worth) and put to work as galley slaves.","popularity":0.6849,"poster_path":"/9Z1tWNsuDqBnVFmiX5KQ34dPZAI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10748,"logo_path":null,"name":"George A.
