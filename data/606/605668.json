I was making loads of photographic and film work, and experimenting with organic processing techniques. There were 9 of us who were in residence at Arteles. When I was due to leave, I actually missed my flight – the first time in a lifetime of flights – and when I arrived back at Arteles that afternoon (much to everyone’s surprise!), this film is what happened… I see it as a sketch of life at Arteles, a line drawing with silver of a chance happening that I would have missed had I got on that flight.\" — M.J.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shaved Head, Missed Flight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
