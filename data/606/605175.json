Will the computer replace the automobile?\" These questions are taken up by six prominent writers, musicians, and multi-media workers, who describe their own shifting relationships to technology and public space within the city. Awakening from the 20th Century is structured around imagery from several San Francisco sites: the broadcast transmission tower Sutro Tower; \"Critical Mass,\" an activist bicycle event; and locations from the Dashiel Hammet Walking Tour, which are interspersed with scenes from The Maltese Falcon.","popularity":0.0923,"poster_path":"/7G4dPyPFAbTigjFNGagnWQU5fX6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95958,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Arts Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Awakening from the 20th Century","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Homer Flynn","original_name":"Homer Flynn","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5cec7feac3a3685e87248f7c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371171,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Sanborn","original_name":"John Sanborn","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/1OVLASxrZi1F8FaQmIAyFjfJ7TK.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5cec7ffc0e0a26272bc994d4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Ullman","original_name":"Ellen Ullman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5cec800a9251410642b82728","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gannon Hall","original_name":"Gannon Hall","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5cec801592514110dbb82366","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Solnit","original_name":"Rebecca Solnit","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5cec8033c3a368441e1e5292","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1899485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chip Lord","original_name":"Chip Lord","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cec7f9fc3a36838131e4e04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1899485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chip Lord","original_name":"Chip Lord","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cec7fad925141669ebd6b1c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1899485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chip Lord","original_name":"Chip Lord","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cec7fa60e0a263f4aca17c5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1899485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chip Lord","original_name":"Chip Lord","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cec7fd00e0a261bbbd083f1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7G4dPyPFAbTigjFNGagnWQU5fX6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
