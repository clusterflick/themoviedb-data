They are as follows: 1 - daytime, facing east, with animation, desert from a window; 2 - daytime, facing south, with same animation, desert from a window; 3 - daytime, facing west, doghouse from a window; 4 - night, in front of a fireplace on the north wall; animation. The early pleasures are in the texture of the paper on the desert in the 1st two sections, side-lit (like a sea or dimpled skin), and the sun's first ray on the curled corner; the thrill of the comparison of places. Then maybe, the thrill that they actually exist in the same time and place, and are not contrived in an optical printer; then to learn that the fades in and out of the animation are by changes in the natural light.  Preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2007.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Corners","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2050080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Wilson","original_name":"Diana Wilson","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cec201c0e0a265cded7c389","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309397,"name":"preserved film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
