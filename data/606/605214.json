When Billy pays for a number of gowns with a bad check, Iva is sent to Rita's home to collect the finery, and there she meets Bertrand Seldon, whom she recognizes as her own father, a society man who had deserted his wife years earlier and never acknowledged Iva. Rita learns that Billy is poor and breaks off their affair, after which Iva persuades him to pose as her fianc√© so that she might enter society. Billy is content to maintain the masquerade in exchange for Iva's money, but soon finds himself jealous over her apparent romance with Bertrand. Iva agrees to accompany Bertrand on a drive, but the car plunges down a cliff, whereupon she reveals her identity. Before his death, Bertrand at last recognizes his daughter, and with his fortune, she and Billy begin a new life.","popularity":0.1919,"poster_path":"/l1sXIPt2UL2Ch0VyHhSJbnLqd27.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Model's Confession","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary MacLaren","original_name":"Mary MacLaren","popularity":0.1076,"profile_path":"/Agteg70nmBZmFT9XQMD72TVqiiw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Iva Seldon","credit_id":"5cecc16092514175e8bee760","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Harlan","original_name":"Kenneth Harlan","popularity":0.1332,"profile_path":"/nIiGHwnOGFrZW2pui9rUKRFPs5p.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Billy Ravensworth","credit_id":"5cecc1660e0a263f4aca7567","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2317719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edna Earle","original_name":"Edna Earle","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Rita Challoner","credit_id":"5cecc16e9251416983ba1aa9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Prior","original_name":"Herbert Prior","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/wN0WTT9TqPt6JvI5JsnGhp2yoMN.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bertrand Seldon","credit_id":"5cecc1769251414398bce2c7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Willoughby","original_name":"Louis Willoughby","popularity":0.0473,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5cecc17e0e0a264fd1cc3b93","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1378005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gretchen Lederer","original_name":"Gretchen Lederer","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/8UZKLwtV5vcC0EBZYVFHRAIHzJD.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5cecc1850e0a261bf2cefb1d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1405766,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"King D.
