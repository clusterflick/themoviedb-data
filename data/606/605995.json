Dry leaves, wooden floors and a young man smoking a cigarette. Windows and doors are preparing the framing. The wind is coming up. Will it rain today? A young woman is pressing her face to a TV screen, all in blue but it is not water refreshing her. In her eyes, you see some hidden memories and dirty tennis balls lying on the street sucking up the drops of the rain.","popularity":0.2967,"poster_path":"/z8OP99sUO5ZB3jQrsXCYvOff70J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Underground Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"The Underground Water","type":"The film has two names."}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natsuyo Kanahama","original_name":"Natsuyo Kanahama","popularity":0.0881,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"638e3684bd990c008677f934","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1746777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenji Onishi","original_name":"大西健児","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/kL0hv7pNJM83XYoByGsMQQdcpb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"656473018f26bc00e23c6cec","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4125207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaoru Osawa","original_name":"Kaoru Osawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"65648b8ea6c10401382b0d1c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1985628,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenji Murakami","original_name":"村上賢司","popularity":0.1529,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"65648b9f244182010cb5e784","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1746777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenji Onishi","original_name":"大西健児","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/kL0hv7pNJM83XYoByGsMQQdcpb.jpg","credit_id":"5cf12f75c3a3682e261e244b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1g59iyannrRCTP13VnbsT2KPb1H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/z8OP99sUO5ZB3jQrsXCYvOff70J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
