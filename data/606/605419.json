Amid homesickness, difficulty communicating in Portuguese and tiredness from work, Chen can't fit in anywhere. At night, alone and when the streets are empty, the asphalt becomes meditation and there he can dream. It is a fiction created and set in real locations in collaboration with the characters themselves, all non-professional actors who play themselves, creating a portrait with documentary aspects, both of their lives and of the center of Curitiba.","popularity":0.2306,"poster_path":"/66MGxC3NjMwCzHsdZAgP5YRJIkr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118994,"logo_path":null,"name":"Estúdio Tijucas","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Canção do Asfalto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Pavement Song","type":"English Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mengran Zhang","original_name":"Mengran Zhang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5cedf6cc9251411943b8540d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1906293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Giongo","original_name":"Pedro Giongo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cedf6d79251411943b85421","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1906293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Giongo","original_name":"Pedro Giongo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cedf6e09251411943b85425","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1906293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Giongo","original_name":"Pedro Giongo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cedf6e9925141669ebfcad2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1478530,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nathália Tereza","original_name":"Nathália Tereza","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cedf6f30e0a264fd1ce6e86","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945414,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Renato Ogata","original_name":"Renato Ogata","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cedf6ff0e0a261bbbd2fe44","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945412,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lucas Maffini","original_name":"Lucas Maffini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cedf70a925141669ebfcafc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Biagioli","original_name":"William Biagioli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cedf719c3a3685182207295","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323986,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lígia Teixeira","original_name":"Lígia Teixeira","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cedf7259251410fe2b85862","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428757,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tiago Bello","original_name":"Tiago Bello","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cedf7310e0a263f4accabaf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1499704,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marcos Lopes","original_name":"Marcos Lopes","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cedf73bc3a36825e120685e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6574210","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/66MGxC3NjMwCzHsdZAgP5YRJIkr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":711}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
