The Greek state has ceded its mining rights over 31.700 ha of land in northern Halkidiki, a region rich in gold, copper and other metals, to the Canadian multinational company Eldorado Gold. However, many of the region’s inhabitants, who have been resisting the construction of a goldmine for years, claim that this investment will cause irreparable damage to the environment and the benefits will be fewer than the losses.  “Cassandra’s Treasure” presents a detailed picture of the modern Greek state before and during the crisis period.","popularity":0.3307,"poster_path":"/scgT9SZGXrTw5H1AtfJahOxV4oU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Small planet","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2012-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Golden Times – Cassandra’s Treasure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324320,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anastasia Skoubri","original_name":"Anastasia Skoubri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cee7f969251414398bfb3e3","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324319,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Georgia Anagnou","original_name":"Georgia Anagnou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cee7f83c3a36865611ecb9e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324326,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vasilis Magos","original_name":"Vasilis Magos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cee7fcf92514110dbbb2808","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324325,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Theofilos Dadis","original_name":"Theofilos Dadis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cee7fbb9251411943b917bd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324330,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yiannis Paxevanis","original_name":"Yiannis Paxevanis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cee7ff30e0a261bbbd3cfad","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yorgos Avgeropoulos","original_name":"Γιώργος Αυγερόπουλος","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/i9NCy9ntQgefKLVMsLQc6PpbzKu.jpg","credit_id":"5cee7f680e0a2613cdca936d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324328,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anna Prokou","original_name":"Anna Prokou","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cee7fdd92514134d7b92683","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324323,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yiannis Avgeropoulos","original_name":"Yiannis Avgeropoulos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cee7fad9251413ad1b91eac","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2798076","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"el","file_path":"/scgT9SZGXrTw5H1AtfJahOxV4oU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1321,"name":"gold"},{"id":1200,"name":"greece"},{"id":1295,"name":"europe"},{"id":6015,"name":"mining"},{"id":33577,"name":"environment"},{"id":254887,"name":"cassandras treasure"},{"id":254893,"name":"golden times"},{"id":254894,"name":"halkidiki"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
