Insights into Brancusi’s legacy are presented by Carl Andre, Lynda Benglis, Ellsworth Kelly, Martin Puryear, Richard Serra, and Joel Shapiro, with additional commentary on Dan Flavin, Donald Judd, Roy Lichtenstein, Isamu Noguchi,and Claes Oldenburg.  In 1995, Anne d’Harnoncourt, Director Emeritus of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, asked Checkerboard to document the PMA’s acclaimed retrospective on Brancusi for the Museum’s archive. The resulting footage became the genesis of the documentary.","popularity":0.0791,"poster_path":"/aKxZkwl15zvjcDkFM11HlOJS2c3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55550,"logo_path":null,"name":"Checkerboard Film Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Constantin Brancusi (1876-1957), the most important sculptor of the first half of the 20th century, has been a fascinating and enduring influence on a generation of contemporary American artists.","title":"On The Wings of Brancusi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Andre","original_name":"Carl Andre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Carl Andre","credit_id":"5cec5ba8c3a3685e872458a9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynda Benglis","original_name":"Lynda Benglis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lynda Benglis","credit_id":"5cec5bb892514175e8be4f8c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellsworth Kelly","original_name":"Ellsworth Kelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ellsworth Kelly","credit_id":"5cec5bc30e0a261bbbd03faa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Puryear","original_name":"Martin Puryear","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Martin Puryear","credit_id":"5cec5bcd9251410be2b8690e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel Shapiro","original_name":"Joel Shapiro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Joel Shapiro","credit_id":"5cec5be5c3a36829691e2345","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Serra","original_name":"Richard Serra","popularity":0.1498,"profile_path":"/aIKTeQv73Jhzz8qnK7Ap0GL7JYm.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5ec2a30f18b751001fc8eff1","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1477384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgar Howard","original_name":"Edgar Howard","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cec5cf10e0a264fd1cba4ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323079,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Wald","original_name":"Susan Wald","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cec5cfc925141522bbe4858","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Wald","original_name":"Susan Wald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cec5d09c3a36829691e2504","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1477384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgar Howard","original_name":"Edgar Howard","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cec5ce69251414398bc533b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.721,"height":988,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aKxZkwl15zvjcDkFM11HlOJS2c3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":712}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Brancusi Trailer","key":"311732176","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-01-16T18:44:02.000Z","id":"5cec5b6092514175e8be4f49"}]}}}
