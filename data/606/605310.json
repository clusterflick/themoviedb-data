In opposition to them stand a thousand immigrants from the former Soviet Union, ex-military men from the Red Army, who yearn to be recruited into the IDF and fight for Israel, but who are denied the right to serve in the army. Through the stories of Oleg and Alex, immigrants and the battalion's charismatic commanders, the story of the Russkii Battalion is told. It is a story of contrasts between the hardships of the daily struggles they face as new immigrants against the pride and the sense of belonging they find in the battalion. The Russkii Battalion is a film about a militaristic social bubble, in a country that is in constant war.","popularity":0.2519,"poster_path":"/iAnBxB29zaby0Y0TASHzMjykJhn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Together, Stronger!","title":"Gdud A'liyah","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1538302,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Valentin Belonogov","original_name":"Валентин Белоногов","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62475951a349110094343ee9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33009,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yoram Globus","original_name":"Yoram Globus","popularity":0.2204,"profile_path":"/bKbeXNvErtCQiK3pEEnFgmR9cvo.jpg","credit_id":"5ced5f9c0e0a261bf2cffa53","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2288611,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joshua Faudem","original_name":"Joshua Faudem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ced5fb592514156e7b8cfc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323674,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sasha Lutsky","original_name":"Sasha Lutsky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ced600fc3a36833cc1f3800","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iAnBxB29zaby0Y0TASHzMjykJhn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":536,"name":"israel"},{"id":5907,"name":"palestinian-israeli conflict"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":2111,"name":"soviet union"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
