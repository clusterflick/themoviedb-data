One of them will go, driven away by the progressive disappearance of his companion. There is an interval between two lives, in which each of them plunges individually.

Every man for himself, but one towards the other.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/yWdG4jBLrVBitelx4lCfyTjQmA9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1046750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Patrick Carpentier","original_name":"Patrick Carpentier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ced898d9251416cbeb93556","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yWdG4jBLrVBitelx4lCfyTjQmA9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":572}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
