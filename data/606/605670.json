I wanted to use a filmmaking process that was gentle on the magnificent environment I was in, and that’s what I came up with. I then inverted the film to create a positive image, where instead of being black, the trees are coloured. This is a new technique I developed, and have since shared with the artist analogue filmmaking community. ‘Silva’ is Latin for forest, and ‘silver’ is the essence of cinema, in all its many shades. I recorded the sound in the same forest, just as the snow began to slowly melt and the cranes were flying back for the beginning of Spring.\" — M.J.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silva Shade","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1302276,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martha Jurksaitis","original_name":"Martha Jurksaitis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cef32f70e0a263878ca3108","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
