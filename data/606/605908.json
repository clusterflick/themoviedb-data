A troubling portrait of the filmmaker, a son to one of the founding families of Metula (a town on the northernmost Israeli border). Against the backdrop of a family dealing with illness and death, the film's protagonist is repeatedly called for reserve duty as a Tank Commander in the Israeli army. Through use of archive footage of events filmed over the course of a decade, the tragic-comic clash between the filmmaker and the habit of obedience unfolds.","popularity":0.0674,"poster_path":"/vBIcC8GPVUAV0r7qtsELIXYslyT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Powder","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1481275,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ayal Goldberg","original_name":"Ayal Goldberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cf085b00e0a266b1dcbc9de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2522948","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.686,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vBIcC8GPVUAV0r7qtsELIXYslyT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":686}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
