Filmmakers Negin Kianfar and Daisy Mohr offer filmed portraits of three Iranian transsexuals and how they live their lives. Mahtab is a man in the outside world, but lives as a woman at home, which angers his father and confuses his mother, though they've come to accept his decision to have a sex change. Saye, meanwhile, is a woman trapped in a man's body who has not been as lucky as Mahtab - after repeated violence from her father, she was banished from the family home, and now shares an apartment with her lover, Afshin. Afshin is also a transsexual, but since becoming a man, he insists Saye stay home and observe the cultural restrictions that apply to women in a fundamentalist Muslim society.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Birthday","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Negin Kianfar","original_name":"Negin Kianfar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cef4e170e0a26113cc9914a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daisy Mohr","original_name":"Daisy Mohr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cef4e250e0a260430c992ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1158683","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
