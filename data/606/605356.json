Rather than just have people listen to it, Oz artist and animator Robert Roy MacVeigh provided a large number of watercolor paintings. To preserve MacVeigh’s wonderful slideshow, the presentation was put on videotape posthumously in 1993. In this adaptation Dorothy, the Wizard, cousin Zeb, Jim the Horse, and Dorothy’s cat, Eureka, have an adventure throughout some of the surrounding countries of Oz.","popularity":0.4262,"poster_path":"/mHetjGDemyxrud56Rksl5PexzRq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118983,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hyperion Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":118984,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rob Roy Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":118985,"logo_path":null,"name":"The International Wizard of Oz Club Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dorothy & the Wizard in Oz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosemary Rice","original_name":"Rosemary Rice","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Dorothy","credit_id":"5ced8e18c3a36825e11fb78a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Lynn","original_name":"Billy Lynn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"The Wizard","credit_id":"5ced8e99c3a368441e203cdf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Jenkins","original_name":"Patricia Jenkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Cousin Zeb / Princess Ozma","credit_id":"5ced8ee9c3a3682e93268ec9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"LeRoi Operti","original_name":"LeRoi Operti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"The Braided Man","credit_id":"5ced8faf92514110dbb9d24a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9051,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"L.
