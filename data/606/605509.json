But this film takes a different view, showing how it has been shaped by geology and climate, by tales told on the side of the road and in the corners of pubs. Whisky is a product of folklore and myth, of music and alchemy, of chance rather than design. This is the twisting, shifting and multi-layered tale.  In this journey through the lesser-known parts of Scottish whisky culture, we follow spirits writer Dave Broom on his quest to gain a deeper understanding of his national drink. While whisky has never been as popular, it is often seen in the context of being a brand which sits outside people’s lives. It’s often thought of as a drink which speaks of the past rather than engaged with a dynamic present.","popularity":0.569,"poster_path":"/4K0XpajvEwXNlpIeE74nqAVIkLb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119010,"logo_path":null,"name":"52 Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Amber Light","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Broom","original_name":"Dave Broom","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5cee8e08c3a368441e21f78c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2324399,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alasdair Gray","original_name":"Alasdair Gray","popularity":0.1385,"profile_path":"/nnWzULDQnvgLgKuh9ISybBEO8OA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5cee8e770e0a261bbbd3e6e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Rankin","original_name":"Ian Rankin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5cee8e9c0e0a265e9dcab6a9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Park","original_name":"Adam Park","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cee8cdc0e0a2615b5caba54","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324395,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Park","original_name":"Adam Park","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cee8cb29251414398bfcd9a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10394178","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.115,"height":217,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mvm6KijHEy1VelCxTDFfjA0evXt.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":459}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1088,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4K0XpajvEwXNlpIeE74nqAVIkLb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":769}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Amber Light (Documentary film trailer)","key":"sl7023x2PAM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-01-18T17:34:44.000Z","id":"600ed185c433ea004043aab4"}]}}}
