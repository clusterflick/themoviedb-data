Although his novelistic work is strongly auto-biographical, he always engaged in Swiss politics. In this movie, he says: \"Although I am writer, my existence is that of a human, a contemporary, a witness, a believer, a doubter, a desperate, an accepter, a refuser, one who loves and wants to be loved, a hater, a creative, an ambitious, a good and a bad mensch\". Filmmakers Walter Marti and Reni Mertens offered Diggelmann one hour of time in order to explain and to defend himself, to accuse, to apologize, to reconsider his judgments.","popularity":0.0695,"poster_path":"/3qmXFQPNudnPpUewHQG0e7CnDdE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Selbstzerstörung des Walter Matthias Diggelmann","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2109477,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Walter Matthias Diggelmann","original_name":"Walter Matthias Diggelmann","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cedd93a9251411943b82dbc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1503512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Marti","original_name":"Walter Marti","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cedd95cc3a36825e1204191","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1503513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reni Mertens","original_name":"Reni Mertens","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cedd96ec3a3682c7f1dcf52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0311779","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.739,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3qmXFQPNudnPpUewHQG0e7CnDdE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":554},{"aspect_ratio":0.74,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ndyufBlgYDaELFPErb2FYVTl9eg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":555}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1973-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
