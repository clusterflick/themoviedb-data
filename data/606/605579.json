An artist steps into an empty studio and begins assembling objects into a tree-like sculpture. The sculpture is adorned with small white paper clouds, puppets and undefinable items; all the while, the studio fills up with new things: a suitcase, a mirror and formal attire. The artist, now wearing a top hat and tuxedo, paints the paper clouds and the wall in a frenzy of activity, ending with his sitting exhausted in a corner surrounded by the mess he has created. The growing chaos, the various layers of narrative and the music of the soundtrack, which was improvised and recorded live during a viewing of the final film cut, interact in counterpoint.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/aTEsVZJXuc8ZD1vw4xbZku3tsAB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76154,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arbetsgruppen för Film","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Tuxedo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arne Högsander","original_name":"Arne Högsander","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ceed9700e0a264146c9b610","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1849795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Lindgren","original_name":"Kurt Lindgren","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ceed9d70e0a263878c990cc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claes Söderquist","original_name":"Claes Söderquist","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ceed9a8c3a3685f011de577","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324608,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Curre Hilfon","original_name":"Curre Hilfon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ceed9b39251410769b84021","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324609,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Carlsson","original_name":"Jan Carlsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ceed9c00e0a26346dc98f21","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2324610,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Wallgren","original_name":"Jan Wallgren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ceed9ca0e0a264146c9b76a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aTEsVZJXuc8ZD1vw4xbZku3tsAB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
