Synaesthesia is an experience of cross-modal sensuality – of ‘seeing green’ or ‘tasting pink’, hearing colours or feeling smells as shapes. I think everyone is latently synaesthetic, and that certain ways of making cinema might be able to trigger the experience. Peach combines artisanal Super 8 filmmaking with complex emotions in an attempt to create ‘Cinesthetic Synaema’. The film’s title comes from a combination of things – the peachy colour of the film which is caused by the way it was made, Jojo’s different experiences of peach as a colour, and an affectionate name my mum gave me as a kid.\" — M.J.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peach","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1302276,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martha Jurksaitis","original_name":"Martha Jurksaitis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cef30b9c3a36809a61dd053","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
