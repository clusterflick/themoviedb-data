One day, he is challenged to leave his house, walk the busy streets, and ask sixty-one strangers for a hug. Although terrified by the inevitable rejections ahead, CK accepts, clinging to his long-standing belief that ‘overthinking is the enemy of remarkable’. Filmed in one take using actual footage from the challenge, ’61 Hugs’ demonstrates the remarkable power of optimism, heart, goodwill, human spirit, spontaneity and the universe.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Rehabilitation Of An Overthinker","title":"61 Hugs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2325664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"CK Goldiing","original_name":"CK Goldiing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cf03d490e0a263ea3cb5406","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
