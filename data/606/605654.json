She is the tarot equivalent of the Queen of Hearts from the deck of playing cards, who also presented to me in a dream as part of myself. The Queen of Cups is associated with the water signs of the horoscope – Pisces, Cancer, and Scorpio (for those interested in astrology, I am a Cancer sun with Scorpio rising). I shot the film at Spurn Point where the North Sea meets the Humber River, while artist in residence at the Three Points of Contact residency. It is filmed on Super 8, hand-processed, and hand-edited.\" — M.J.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anningella Queen of Cups","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1302276,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martha Jurksaitis","original_name":"Martha Jurksaitis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cef2ac5c3a368092d1dc982","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
