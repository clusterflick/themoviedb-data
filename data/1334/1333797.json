Through a process of visual transformation, the human faces shown undergo a sort of symbolic castration due to the abuse, losing their humanity and breaking down into expressions of pain. Each face becomes a tragic mask, symbolizing the loss of identity and dignity inflicted by a system that no longer recognizes people, but only objects to control and repress. The film ends with an eerie silence, accompanied by a sequence of images showing faces now dead and devoid of meaning. These faces, stripped of any distinguishing features, merge into a disturbing gallery that represents the final stage of dehumanization: the complete erasure of individuality.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lP6a32krygecKWXSnhFf2uwDuQE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":236683,"logo_path":null,"name":"Abduction Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VOLTI","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4891598,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emanuele Fiadone","original_name":"Emanuele Fiadone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8tkjMLbPypsEm7JULgEl228XSbt.jpg","credit_id":"66c18850a22139a8d9c21f79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4891598,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emanuele Fiadone","original_name":"Emanuele Fiadone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8tkjMLbPypsEm7JULgEl228XSbt.jpg","credit_id":"66c1885a5f05ec0b2e92314b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4891598,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emanuele Fiadone","original_name":"Emanuele Fiadone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/8tkjMLbPypsEm7JULgEl228XSbt.jpg","credit_id":"66c1886452301b3574c21e85","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1684,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lP6a32krygecKWXSnhFf2uwDuQE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1190}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
