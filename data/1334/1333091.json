In 2011, the Singapore Government announced that the construction of an 8-lane roadway cutting through the heart of the area would begin in two years. In its final year as an intact cemetery - during the grave-sweeping festival of Qing Ming - we speak to the descendants of those buried in Bukit Brown's jungled hills and witness age-old rituals passed down through generations. Through their voices, we see the cemetery, not as a place of the dead, but a site filled with memories and living heritage. Revealed too is the unexpected beauty of a Singapore that visitors rarely see - a secret garden hidden behind the gleaming towers of this Asian metropolis.","popularity":0.0493,"poster_path":"/xYL5S8RAU5FREanZ8dZgmjiJIn1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2013-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bukit Brown Voices","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1896371,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Su-Mae Khoo","original_name":"Su-Mae Khoo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c0f2cf150d42be109dc854","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4891250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian McDiarmant","original_name":"Brian McDiarmant","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c0f3314031a9571f44c6af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4891250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian McDiarmant","original_name":"Brian McDiarmant","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66c0f33eb0f5eadfc5d52b62","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2667206","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"BukitBrownVoices","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1416,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xYL5S8RAU5FREanZ8dZgmjiJIn1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Celebrating Bukit Brown event","release_date":"2013-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer: Bukit Brown Voices","key":"42383883","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-05-18T04:04:22.000Z","id":"66c0f3d195407f9ecec208a5"}]}}}
