A curious wanderer, he comes across an abandoned school at the edge of town. Dark and foreboding, Ian is drawn to the mystique of this new playground. To his surprise, he is not the only one to find this place a new haven. Ian has just stumbled onto the new killing grounds of recently escaped prison convict, Wesson Garr. Once aware of Ian's intrusion, Wesson decides this school isn't big enough for the two of them. A realistic and daring approach to a claustrophobic story of survival.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":269491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Potent Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Belial","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5593902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Brugler","original_name":"Justin Brugler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ryan - Bully #1","credit_id":"6888dbce6c0df3da9b16cd4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5593913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Egnor","original_name":"Jim Egnor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Father Sheridan","credit_id":"6888dd00256e60aa3c52bf5e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5593915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Foran III","original_name":"Robert Foran III","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Edgar","credit_id":"6888dd133c48c4a5bf72fd0b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3560813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wendy Foster","original_name":"Wendy Foster","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Joan Miller","credit_id":"6888defd1f31ce489ced0097","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1413228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Goldsmith","original_name":"Taylor Goldsmith","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Dead Child #1","credit_id":"6888df2f47be019072fe17a5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodney Gray","original_name":"Rodney Gray","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Wesson Garr","credit_id":"6888df40207c5a31a3de1162","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3506002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"April Schutte","original_name":"April Schutte","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/5ob6n8Iz2KlncRLedB1YqyY5VDT.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Jessica Lane","credit_id":"6888df5cd493fd62c7ed00af","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167433,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank Kane","original_name":"Frank Kane","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6888d86b1600dcfb7624714d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Grillo","original_name":"Christian Grillo","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6888d9e093d069e3bd72f6f2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Grillo","original_name":"Christian Grillo","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6888d9edc74b327f5a390840","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5593896,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jim Waryga","original_name":"Jim Waryga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6888dbb23f1f6bc2bed9bbe5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2844682","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
