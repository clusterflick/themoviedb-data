The series blends surreal, satirical narratives—like a woman dating an alien for health insurance benefits and fired colleagues attacking their boss—with critiques of economic instability, political strife, and the art world's role in society. My Barbarian's campy, performance-based style explores themes of collaboration, identity, and societal anxieties through bizarre, yet hauntingly familiar, scenarios.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/p01fWHGrICxR8MRDBoEYbmQlkBI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Night Epi$ode","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Night Episode","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3588541,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"My Barbarian","original_name":"My Barbarian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6888b2af342a4dafbf72f537","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3588541,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"My Barbarian","original_name":"My Barbarian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6888b2b9b1b942dfdc3904d6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1272,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p01fWHGrICxR8MRDBoEYbmQlkBI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11663,"name":"camp"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
