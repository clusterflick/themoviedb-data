It is: obsessed with classical allusion, doomed to camp, adorned in costume, engaged in masquerade and surrounded by sculpture. With a queer attitude toward cheap materials, the Broke People's Baroque People's Theater decorates itself in a hyper-feminine aestheticism to undermine class(y) distinctions of taste. A wealth of poverty, the chintzy is rich.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/7Cl0is2GVSDC7i0WXaOiCbhnjmR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shakuntala DuBois","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3588541,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"My Barbarian","original_name":"My Barbarian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6888b3671d76c9aaa9f796db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Cl0is2GVSDC7i0WXaOiCbhnjmR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11663,"name":"camp"},{"id":356058,"name":"performance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
