Kate goes about her normal life, navigating the tasks of \"adulting.\" She looks like any other woman, going on dates, shopping at night -- but she's haunted in every decision by the \"visions\" of her past and future selves.  Her inner six-year-old harangues her about her ice cream choices. Her sarcastic former teenager makes fun of her intention to go for a run and tries to talk her out of it. And her future older, hopefully wiser, self tries to talk sense into present-day Kate, telling to appreciate her younger, healthy self.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Woman of a Certain Age","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5346100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Dearing","original_name":"Kate Dearing","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688809f998c597f11a8a87a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
