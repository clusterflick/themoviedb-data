Despite his silence about his origins, they choose to adopt him. Years later, Mahfouz grows into a well-adjusted young man and falls in love with the daughter of the man who raised him. But when he asks for her hand, long-buried social prejudices resurface, branding him as an outsider with no lineage. The father, under the guise of a work mission, sends Mahfouz away—only to marry off his daughter to someone else in his absence.\"","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mahfouz","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5593945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdelhamid Albalooshi","original_name":"Abdelhamid Albalooshi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6888e2d3aa6832070f02f708","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5593947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noor Al Ali","original_name":"Noor Al Ali","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6888e326c489c61107a7cf90","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5593948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohammed Trar","original_name":"Mohammed Trar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6888e3843f0038be0aed009c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashwak","original_name":"Ashwak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6888e3b7bc8be9beafd5a61f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5593929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed Al-Saady","original_name":"Mohamed Al-Saady","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6888df6b032ead2405d5a5ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5593569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hatem Salah AlDeen","original_name":"Hatem Salah AlDeen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6888df96032ead2405d5a5f2","department":"Crew","job":"Executive Music Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5593937,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"talal mahmoud","original_name":"talal mahmoud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6888e0de54931a5fa8ed00b8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37522832","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"mahfooz فيلم محفوظ","key":"uG0mZmneKG8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-08-12T05:27:55.000Z","id":"6888def77750ce806aa7cf75"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mahfooz  Promo  \"  برومو فيلم\" محفوظ","key":"0HwaLhlHtxQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2020-08-12T05:17:24.000Z","id":"6888df08194920532bcf02e0"}]}}}
