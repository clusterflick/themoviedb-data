Created for the exhibition \"private views. space re/cognized in contemporary art from Estonia and Britain\" (curated by Mare Tralla and Angela Dimitrakaki in the Estonian Art Museum, 1998) Kiwa was the only male artist on the show and chose, quite pertinently, to focus on the space most associated with male creativity. The mythology of the artist's studio as the protected sanctuary of freedom and self-expression par excellence has risen across diverse techniques of visual signification. Access to the studio means access to a celebrated subjectivity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/gYXSVgJ4TP6k2t4MoKb7hWXLR0K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradisco","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5592803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kiwa","original_name":"Kiwa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6887f7dfdf411187b516cb61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1061,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gYXSVgJ4TP6k2t4MoKb7hWXLR0K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
