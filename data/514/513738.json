The Saturday Nights songs are upbeat, pairing subtle but expressive lyrics with fast-paced, brazen electric guitar; the Sunday Mornings selections have a more reflective, subdued tone. Lead singer Adam Duritz starts the night off right with a raucous version of the CD opener “1492,” then sings of loss in the moody “Washington Square,” accompanied by piano and acoustic guitar. His no-holds-barred emotion also resonates in slower songs like “Le Ballet d'Or” and “When I Dream of Michelangelo.”","popularity":0.4958,"poster_path":"/uO8oOEkz86jXRvGdq3Oq4zvjT6O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Counting Crows: Live at Soundstage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Duritz","original_name":"Adam Duritz","popularity":0.0706,"profile_path":"/zPprYk6RU0gZnzr22GjVQAXKYo5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"605a50826bdec3003daed4cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3022138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Bryson","original_name":"David Bryson","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"605a50b467b613003d4c7ae4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3022144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Vickrey","original_name":"Dan Vickrey","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"605a50f4a34911005443d6d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3022147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Gillingham","original_name":"Charlie Gillingham","popularity":0.1472,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"605a5114a294f000283bf801","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3022148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Immerglück","original_name":"David Immerglück","popularity":0.1297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"605a5124fd4f80005428779a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3022149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Millard Powers","original_name":"Millard Powers","popularity":0.0537,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"605a513167b613006a98f7f3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3022151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Bogios","original_name":"Jim Bogios","popularity":0.0626,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"605a515a01e4d1005366f1c3","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uO8oOEkz86jXRvGdq3Oq4zvjT6O.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1536}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
