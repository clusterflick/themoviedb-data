But when a flirtatious word-spar about sexual positions turns unwittingly into a debate over something else entirely, both men take sides against the other and replace that could-be beautiful connection with anger, resentment and accusation. OCCUPY ME is about the insidious way outside issues can seep into our interpersonal relationships and invade and cloud our perceptions until love is replaced by anger, truth is pushed out by fear, and potential is destroyed by the past.","popularity":0.1952,"poster_path":"/sCLKOoOQ3vYozbO6zcl63VMswRU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":211368,"logo_path":null,"name":"Adam Fitzgerald Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Occupy Me","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1819064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaspal Binning","original_name":"Jaspal Binning","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"5ab6e0230e0a261ff1013c9b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1020528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Rhyser","original_name":"Max Rhyser","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/hE7zhukgYH9hdOaIKWA7kMBqfgG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"David","credit_id":"5ab6e03292514139610130f6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1375096,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eric Perez","original_name":"Eric Perez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cc94a3e24b93009eda98f9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006881,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Fitzgerald","original_name":"Adam Fitzgerald","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab6e14d9251413958012396","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006880,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Blake Drummond","original_name":"Blake Drummond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab6e13e925141395e0122ed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006882,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Harren","original_name":"Michael Harren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab6e16f925141395b01233f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006880,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Blake Drummond","original_name":"Blake Drummond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab6e19ac3a3680a2b011b19","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2006883,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John-Andrew Morrison","original_name":"John-Andrew Morrison","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab6e1ac925141396401198f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006885,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"David L Arsenault","original_name":"David L Arsenault","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab6e2370e0a261fee013372","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1020528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Rhyser","original_name":"Max Rhyser","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/hE7zhukgYH9hdOaIKWA7kMBqfgG.jpg","credit_id":"5ab6e15c0e0a261feb0127cc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006880,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Blake Drummond","original_name":"Blake Drummond","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab6e1880e0a261ff4013491","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006881,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Fitzgerald","original_name":"Adam Fitzgerald","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d8701d3336e010029160feb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5293262","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1q2cTq9VaKiXingBRBnANj5Xjp7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sCLKOoOQ3vYozbO6zcl63VMswRU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3remWLoLSl4xDRGsH4BX1rOBT6Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":674}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Occupy Me -
