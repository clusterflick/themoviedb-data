She blames her grown son Geoffrey (Linden) for the deterioration of her voice, and does everything to destroy his life. When Geoffrey, who works as a commercial artist, announces to her that he will marry Joan Hoyt (Arthur), an actress, she becomes torn with jealousy and threatens to reveal to Joan that he is an illegitimate birth.","popularity":1.7293,"poster_path":"/4QW9sfiM8EJfMJfVnXjJJg2wFKw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A DRAMA OF YOUNG LOVE...SMOTHERED BY A MOTHER'S LOVE!","title":"The Past of Mary Holmes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El pasado de Mary Holmes","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Goose Woman","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen MacKellar","original_name":"Helen MacKellar","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":"/l1LCccu89xQAWwIKQXkIOG7gcnI.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Mary Holmes","credit_id":"5ab35600c3a368615b003b54","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Linden","original_name":"Eric Linden","popularity":0.0738,"profile_path":"/6cVV2Yqh8p5TpRTVxRbMMU7hBgq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Geoffrey Holmes","credit_id":"5ab3560e0e0a265f360042ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Arthur","original_name":"Jean Arthur","popularity":0.3249,"profile_path":"/h46KhIQOOMPUMIdGNSN3A4zwcGQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Joan Hoyt","credit_id":"5ab3561a9251417afb003cab","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard 'Skeets' Gallagher","original_name":"Richard 'Skeets' Gallagher","popularity":0.1035,"profile_path":"/tFmOBk854vXe5dbeO9faNFPBy6j.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ben Pratt","credit_id":"5ab356259251417aff003cf7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":132536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan F.
