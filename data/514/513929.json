Carmen Guarini decided to record those moments. A rough edit of this film was hidden away on a fragile VHS tape for twenty years. Today, these images come to life and shed some light on the life of this Latin American poet and master filmmaker, who, at the age of 92, still refused to give up on his own utopias.","popularity":0.2745,"poster_path":"/63AvO3RST9GBKceeRK74m3ykvI5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2017-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tie Your Plow to a Star","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1131520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fernando Birri","original_name":"Fernando Birri","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/tgatCbyRLh4s96XCmsUEo8rhSRp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5ab7bb3cc3a3680a2b01a892","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduardo Galeano","original_name":"Eduardo Galeano","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/7RWfjJyinIaUMoATdSONuSX1E8x.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66285952b9a0bd017ad904ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2098491,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ernesto Sábato","original_name":"Ernesto Sábato","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/1tEKKFf81McGKiYRKuXhLvkcM9Y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62e5c5eff1b571005e2a8692","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3643547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"León Ferrari","original_name":"León Ferrari","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62e5c5f9fdf8b70061ea45f6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1400929,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tanya Valette","original_name":"Tanya Valette","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62e5c600fc5f060061061dfd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1360755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmen Guarini","original_name":"Carmen Guarini","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e5c611c5840d005c3ca7df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1360755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmen Guarini","original_name":"Carmen Guarini","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab7bb2a0e0a261fe201df96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7697854","wikidata_id":"Q108064960","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/63AvO3RST9GBKceeRK74m3ykvI5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":672}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3469,"name":"utopia"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
