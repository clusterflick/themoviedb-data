One woman is Liotta, as in the title of the film. The other woman, wearing a red cloak, does not provide her name. Throughout the 12 hours that the film covers, she remains cloaked in total silence. Alongside apples and statues of Christ, children’s portraits play a major role as symbols in the film. The film maker says they refer to an approaching birth, but also to the fact that the woman in the red cloak lost her child and her husband in a car accident. The film maker is a follower of the thought that people’s urge to find paradise is linked to the individual experience they had as a fetus in the womb. The unconscious desire for this experience steers our everyday existence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Name Is Liotta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1418976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter van Houten","original_name":"Peter van Houten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab684890e0a261fe500d9a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
