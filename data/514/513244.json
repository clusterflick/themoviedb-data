With trippy lyrics, a middle finger raised to all genres, and a tightly knit bond thanks to many years of friendship, the band is aiming to fly even higher. The film moves with the group from sold-out concerts to isolation in a bunker and a long trip to the Danish island of Bornholm. It depicts a band that tries to find a foothold in a time of unrest and upheaval – both internally in the band and the world in general. The front figure and perfectionist Niels Brandt balances between his own ambitions and a person who in essence is just 33-year-old Niels. But just as the five friends are on the verge of fulfilling the dream that they have harboured since childhood, Niels's creative driving force – his darkness – has suddenly disappeared. Does Niels have to look for his darkness again to be able to formulate his visions?","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/d4BmA83SHo8sbWf8zkNQszTo9bB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big as a sun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1731807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niels Brandt","original_name":"Niels Brandt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gLO0ne1jEcx530UsAZOw8TQ9K9b.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ab2a130c3a3681cff00bccd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2004308,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kasper Kiertzner","original_name":"Kasper Kiertzner","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab2a11e92514139f700c1b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8116368","wikidata_id":"Q76450363","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"da","file_path":"/ylTObfkwgcvla9t3oHjEzANsHpQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"da","file_path":"/d4BmA83SHo8sbWf8zkNQszTo9bB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"7","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
