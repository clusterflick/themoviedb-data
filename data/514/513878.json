The film traces the development group of activists on the Lower East Side. We see their growth from isolated, alienated individuals to a politically empowered community.  Filmed between the protests at the Pentagon and the demonstrations at the Democratic Convention in Chicago, it includes portraits of Abbie Hoffman, editor Paul Krassner, folksinger Phil Ochs and anarchist Tom \"Osha\" Neumann.","popularity":0.3879,"poster_path":"/ceotXuhAiPguCWj3dmjrbwwQvqv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Summer Won't Happen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abbie Hoffman","original_name":"Abbie Hoffman","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/zM4EOuvFgw8OfR3ITDv6UHBTciS.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5cf802be0e0a26706ec9ddb5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Krassner","original_name":"Paul Krassner","popularity":0.1609,"profile_path":"/Annp8olwRTkkzNrqa4mo3LJnXms.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6254a0f08e2e00143542c26d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Osha Neumann","original_name":"Tom Osha Neumann","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ab773c80e0a261fee0197c0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2007011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Ochs","original_name":"Phil Ochs","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/fd9GLK4ze0HDnutiX5GBB6dwWiC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ab773cf0e0a261fdf01b508","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Gessner","original_name":"Peter Gessner","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab773f70e0a261feb01890c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Gessner","original_name":"Peter Gessner","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab7740992514139640176e6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143066,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tom Hurwitz","original_name":"Tom Hurwitz","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab773ffc3a3680a31017e6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Gessner","original_name":"Peter Gessner","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab77413925141396101976e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143066,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tom Hurwitz","original_name":"Tom Hurwitz","popularity":0.111,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab77423c3a3680a2801a042","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1043432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Gessner","original_name":"Peter Gessner","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab77419c3a3680a490199f4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2221727","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ceotXuhAiPguCWj3dmjrbwwQvqv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"New York Film Festival","release_date":"1968-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
