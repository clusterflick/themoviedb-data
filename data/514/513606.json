With the decadence of 1920's Berlin, but all in a muddy field. A film of the dark, self-destructive side of creativity and the personal trauma behind it.","popularity":0.2049,"poster_path":"/oN7CtIAxKrmFEJ4L1dUt82pm6Fr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
