The film is situated in a sanatorium where Anna’s dreams and memories are juxtaposed with events at Anna’s home, where she has two children. In the meantime, a special yet doomed relationship develops in the clinic between the young women and Leonore, one of the nurses. Much of the film was re-shot a second time from a monitor, for which the director developed a special camera. In addition, van Houten thought of a way to filter the images of Anna’s memories and re-scanned them to make the newly created images reminiscent of paintings.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2001-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Exposition of Anna Zharkov","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1418976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter van Houten","original_name":"Peter van Houten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab682ee0e0a261fdf00e551","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
