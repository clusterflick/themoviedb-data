The cape, designed by Thirring and called the Thirring mantel, is made of parachute silk and acts somewhat like a parachute to provide its wearer reduced speed while shushing down the slopes. But it also provides lift so that the skier is lighter on his skis, almost weightless. This \"flight\" somewhat mimics the experience felt by those participating in the relatively new sport of ski-flying (also known as ski jumping), which must have exacting conditions (i.e. little wind, hard packed snow) to ensure safety. Even in ideal conditions, ski-flying is a dangerous sport, especially if the landing is not executed properly.","popularity":0.278,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6,"logo_path":"/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png","name":"RKO Radio Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1956-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ski-Flying","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Ski Flying","type":"Simplified title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Sportscope (1955-1956 season) #7: Ski-Flying","type":"Series title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Baruch","original_name":"André Baruch","popularity":0.0576,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5ab4316fc3a36861730120c8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2005362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Thirring","original_name":"Hans Thirring","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ab431779251417b080115c0","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1688616,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stan Russell","original_name":"Stan Russell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab431be9251417b08011602","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1688615,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Earle Luby","original_name":"Earle Luby","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab4319b0e0a265f2d013bc5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203996,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heinz Scheiderbauer","original_name":"Heinz Scheiderbauer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab431919251417af6010cf1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203996,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heinz Scheiderbauer","original_name":"Heinz Scheiderbauer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f24b41a2ac49900365e46c5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1948619","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":240435,"name":"scientific experiment"},{"id":245203,"name":"ski jumping"},{"id":248915,"name":"skiing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1956-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
