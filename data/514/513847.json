Every frame of this recorded movement is then manually translated into a ceramic layer that is made of the original remains of the cup. All the layers are then arranged vertically and glued together, forming a new object that visualizes the destructive moment. As this new form emerges gravity starts to shift pulling the new object into destruction as well. This cycle repeatedly keeps breaking the old to create the new, by translating destructive moments into higher dimensional forms.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/nvfJBqQS4s3onlGwArq6KqZa5yI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2014-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Descent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1277814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Rijpma","original_name":"Johan Rijpma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab70e91c3a3680a3e015463","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.64,"height":2700,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nvfJBqQS4s3onlGwArq6KqZa5yI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
