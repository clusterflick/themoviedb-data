The camera takes a look at the backstage, captures the last rehearsals, follows the work of the technical crew, costume preparations and the banter between the signer and the pianist. Backstage, fans are collecting autographs and take photographs with artists. This is the festival microcosm as seen from all possible perspectives. The stage seems to be somewhere far away as the process of music creation and the commotion that accompanies it is more important.","popularity":0.0614,"poster_path":"/5pUAAD9zAIDDltMiIn2JKgtAEAv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":222911,"logo_path":"/4RNFApZW3Vn3EdGMcxSrCU7RQYo.png","name":"The Fryderyk Chopin Institute","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2017-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Festiwal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2201939,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Gawlita","original_name":"Anna Gawlita","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1230f643d9b10038589373","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2201939,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Gawlita","original_name":"Anna Gawlita","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670bcd4b37d86d520bb0eb0f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1571207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomasz Wolski","original_name":"Tomasz Wolski","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670bcd573bb4557c669b9732","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1571207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomasz Wolski","original_name":"Tomasz Wolski","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670bcd6137d86d520bb0eb1c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1571207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomasz Wolski","original_name":"Tomasz Wolski","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"670bcd6c4111be4f0274a8b1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5pUAAD9zAIDDltMiIn2JKgtAEAv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Krak√≥w Film Festival","release_date":"2017-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Transatlantyk Film Festival","release_date":"2018-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tucson Film & Music Festival","release_date":"2018-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
