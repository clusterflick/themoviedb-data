The case calls into question whole areas of accepted scientific fact from botany, through chemistry to archaeology. In 1992, routine tests on a mummy in a Munich museum revealed high body levels of cocaine and nicotine. But such substances were not available in ancient Egypt, coming as they do from the Americas – not, apparently, to be “discovered” for thousands of years after the passing of the Egyptian dynasties. Are the mummies fakes; were the substances from plants that have since disappeared or were there, in fact, trade routes between Egypt and South America that predate accepted chronology?","popularity":0.1573,"poster_path":"/2G1BICiXwNWukz1LUWUqohexyhz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1996-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mystery of the Cocaine Mummies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Ellis","original_name":"Robin Ellis","popularity":0.1732,"profile_path":"/eVZFtqmZPhaeU18rYAkn6YAUUJb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66d9585f463a1e11b06068df","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4924510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Baines","original_name":"John Baines","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66d9588309b40837110983d7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4924511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Svetlana Balabanova","original_name":"Svetlana Balabanova","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66d95892a6340e39739d9f22","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Marris","original_name":"Sarah Marris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d95829ac5ccaa8339d9fe4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Marris","original_name":"Sarah Marris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d958367a7985a620606a98","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15439164","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2G1BICiXwNWukz1LUWUqohexyhz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1996-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
