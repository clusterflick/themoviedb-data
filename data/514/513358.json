Despite Scott knowing that this was a homophobic hate crime, the assault was not treated as such in the courts, or by the media. As Scott rebuilds his life, he is forced to make sense of the way the incident was handled while also struggling to make peace with his attacker. Taking place across the three years following this life-changing ordeal, close friend and filmmaker Laura Marie Wayne gracefully charts the impact of the attack on Scott’s life, both physically and mentally. The resulting documentary is a tender, heartbreaking and inspiring testament to one man’s strength and resilience.","popularity":0.2781,"poster_path":"/egCl6L7hrFhTpBf9dVc9G7Amh70.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love, Scott","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2004951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Marie Wayne","original_name":"Laura Marie Wayne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab3b7359251417b020088d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3895885,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex Salter","original_name":"Alex Salter","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/1J7CnBudXrV4XAkvuOPUlyzVNGZ.jpg","credit_id":"67f893d17f70ac1a21d91b61","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1116370,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annette Clarke","original_name":"Annette Clarke","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f893e5d3ab7d7a8bad7855","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1116370,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annette Clarke","original_name":"Annette Clarke","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f893ecd3ab7d7a8bad785d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2004951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Marie Wayne","original_name":"Laura Marie Wayne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f893fbde5e4dec62ad5a38","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2004951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Marie Wayne","original_name":"Laura Marie Wayne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f89407cce7690230ad5275","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1686676,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marcos Caraballo","original_name":"Marcos Caraballo","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f894136c3583c9759a38d6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":44074,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sigur Rós","original_name":"Sigur Rós","popularity":0.1185,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f894326c3583c9759a38e8","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Simms","original_name":"Justin Simms","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f8943d1bc639566ad9d753","department":"Writing","job":"Story Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2004951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Marie Wayne","original_name":"Laura Marie Wayne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f8945cde5e4dec62ad5a72","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9056522","wikidata_id":"Q54829043","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/50Ug12Nsy2ocNGEDv8ynOVyjPW6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5v9sv9TI9II6zmgDX7qq5inSTxT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/egCl6L7hrFhTpBf9dVc9G7Amh70.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":650}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
