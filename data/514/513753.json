They are the rising stars in architecture-previously an all-male galaxy--and they are literally and figuratively changing the landscape. MAKING SPACE captures the compelling stories and outstanding designs of Annabelle Selldorf (NY), Farshid Moussavi (London), Odile Decq (Paris), Marianne McKenna (Toronto), and Kathryn Gustafson (Seattle & London). Without script or narration, each woman tells her own story, enhanced by the insights of commentators including Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Paul Goldberger; MoMA's Peter Reed and Paola Antonelli; and others. Meryl Streep makes a special guest appearance.","popularity":0.4235,"poster_path":"/sUr7Eg5DhJvxp75s9djDZbYCTpS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102505,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amici Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"For the first time in history, women are designing our world.
