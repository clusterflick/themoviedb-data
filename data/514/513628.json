Equally, Gallagher combines aspects of different cinemas – documentary, structural, poetic, narrative, and personal – skillfully interweaving all the elements into a complex yet coherent and surprisingly moving statement on the human condition. The most brilliant film on its subject I’ve ever seen, Time Being is cool and non-academic yet deeply engaged, and beautifully shot. An educational film in the best sense.  —Tony Reif","popularity":0.1216,"poster_path":"/4iNJQ1ZogfXK8dyBhffnsY5cb73.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Being","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Gallagher","original_name":"Chris Gallagher","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/1WuVG70ZOEcDuZJkTlSALLNYNfd.jpg","credit_id":"5ab579b40e0a260ecb0005b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4iNJQ1ZogfXK8dyBhffnsY5cb73.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":170487,"name":"essay film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
