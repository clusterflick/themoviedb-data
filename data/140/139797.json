The play is concerned with three young men, Len, Pete and Mark, and the scene of action shifts back and forth between Len's house and Mark's. Sometimes all three come together, sometimes only two, and often Len is on stage alone. There are conversations and soliloquies filled with the brilliant convolutions of thought, the sudden flashes of truth which distinguish Pinter's unique style, with the mood ranging from calm introspection to explosive outpouring. Much of what is said hints at deeper thoughts left unspoken, and the sense of horror and alienation which often emerges is a searing indictment of our life and times. We meet, we talk, we tear at each other, but our insularity is seldom penetrated. We are together but alone, as though life were a mirror which reflects only our own image.","popularity":1.0071,"poster_path":"/dab8x83CYcFIFjk2Rx9k9tMgIPA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2002-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dwarfs","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":203581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Caplan","original_name":"Ben Caplan","popularity":0.2031,"profile_path":"/vYPuTXPfHccKSdjAOPp7FBE3wqm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mark","credit_id":"52fe4c6dc3a368484e1b7bff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":209458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daisy Haggard","original_name":"Daisy Haggard","popularity":0.578,"profile_path":"/10T4bAeX8AkjNFchad2mOPtAyuV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Virginia","credit_id":"52fe4c6dc3a368484e1b7c03","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":996497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Rice-Oxley","original_name":"Mark Rice-Oxley","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Len","credit_id":"52fe4c6dc3a368484e1b7c07","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1700698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Lee","original_name":"Jamie Lee","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/yCs4fkinAJrolKbHj9gMCCy74sg.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Pete","credit_id":"5d7d389ef0647c000f9bb41f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Morahan","original_name":"Christopher Morahan","popularity":0.1422,"profile_path":"/2aWIF1dgrbquLWSM4PN7gh7O4Wt.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c6dc3a368484e1b7bf5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26157,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harold Pinter","original_name":"Harold Pinter","popularity":0.2656,"profile_path":"/w0ItHr1DFWT01i07354nFZ3cX04.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c6dc3a368484e1b7bfb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2956546,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patricia Greenland","original_name":"Patricia Greenland","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674b1987f043bc8a6771ad57","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1014524,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Peter Coulson","original_name":"Peter Coulson","popularity":0.0876,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674b19a968a603b06a394105","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1409408,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Kezia De Winne","original_name":"Kezia De Winne","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674b19b34593a7f05c015227","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":20778,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Dany Everett","original_name":"Dany Everett","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674b19bf4593a7f05c01522d","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1017701,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Eileen Diss","original_name":"Eileen Diss","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674b19cce2df00a3bb7850ca","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3540626,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Harvey","original_name":"Peter Harvey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674b1a3751d26ba93c78ac7c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30333,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Fell","original_name":"Richard Fell","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674b1a43d9409b13d2978656","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0907635","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1056,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/szLv8w52ixj3J7e3xcnIw5YUCC9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":704},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":798,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jXCu6sIj8NYfVFHhh58vEgjGdAc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":798,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dab8x83CYcFIFjk2Rx9k9tMgIPA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
