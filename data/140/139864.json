However, Peter only moves to the summerhouse. The firm decision of Peter and Nina: \"We want to remain friends and continue to care for our children as well as possible.\" This is not just lip service but really the intention of both parents. After all, you're grown up. Already at the very beginning of her new life, however, it can be felt that Peter does not take this separation as seriously as Nina, who is clearly the driving force behind Peter's departure.","popularity":0.3815,"poster_path":"/tckG7m8gq1OSWo565taIdYqATMc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Klügere zieht aus","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthias Koeberlin","original_name":"Matthias Koeberlin","popularity":0.2365,"profile_path":"/c8NeOISGKyT3cmk16qOZWPvbZ8R.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Peter Fischer","credit_id":"52fe4c6fc3a368484e1b8199","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Richter","original_name":"Julia Richter","popularity":0.1175,"profile_path":"/eNKaejQvsPZX0KEfr0X3Io0zve3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nina Fischer","credit_id":"53e34011c3a3684853001ca7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Seyfi","original_name":"Tim Seyfi","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/9csZ96eXdjtlxgkpg8X69xboVgD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bora","credit_id":"569f9482c3a36858c300997d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Große","original_name":"Christina Große","popularity":0.4381,"profile_path":"/fG4JnnB6z9S1KGVugJQpClionkm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Kerstin","credit_id":"569f9491925141370b0022e0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Koschitz","original_name":"Julia Koschitz","popularity":0.5619,"profile_path":"/3ClR7EnHkxHDGzfXfU3H0jFzdBS.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Julia","credit_id":"569f94a3c3a36858c3009983","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1104730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Böer","original_name":"Simon Böer","popularity":0.1914,"profile_path":"/dADYkRn94WmAIZrU7dbXdOlDwE2.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Thorben","credit_id":"569f94b3925141095800602f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Kroehnert","original_name":"Sebastian Kroehnert","popularity":0.1865,"profile_path":"/EBczQ25I58RLbLGZ2JoANPioNI.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Niko","credit_id":"5770570692514157a6002d03","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Prager","original_name":"Peter Prager","popularity":0.2511,"profile_path":"/6m9J6Quf648k6s9pDSPh46wB6pC.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Apotheker","credit_id":"5adfb8d09251411076006655","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2190210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liam Mockridge","original_name":"Liam Mockridge","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Junge","credit_id":"5c09acd00e0a2638b802a8f5","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213244,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Schnee","original_name":"Christoph Schnee","popularity":0.0564,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c6fc3a368484e1b8195","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2073074","wikidata_id":"Q1194841","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gMKWvFqJ6XO3CkVphrIdS84zqUv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/tckG7m8gq1OSWo565taIdYqATMc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
