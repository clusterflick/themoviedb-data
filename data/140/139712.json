The crisis triggered the deepest global recession in 70 years and prompted the US government to spend more than 1 trillion dollars in order to rescue its banking system from collapse. Today the full implications of the crisis in Europe and around the world still remain unclear. Nevertheless, should we accept the crisis as an unfortunate side-effect of the free market? Or is there another explanation as to why it happened and its likely effects on our society, our economy and our whole way of life?","popularity":0.1252,"poster_path":"/7dMdikDXDhyPRukUuM1UTFR7kDp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Which pill will you take?","title":"Marx Reloaded","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1038108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Barker","original_name":"Jason Barker","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Karl Marx (voice)","credit_id":"52fe4c6ac3a368484e1b7403","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":556160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Hardt","original_name":"Michael Hardt","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cc1b12ec3a368694c8d7b2f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1865839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Negri","original_name":"Antonio Negri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cc1b1499251412ba1f532f6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1892671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Nikolić","original_name":"Ivan Nikolić","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Leon Trotsky (voice)","credit_id":"5cc1b1569251415cd2f29419","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2296627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Power","original_name":"Nina Power","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cc1b1610e0a2619d6efd690","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2294754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Rancière","original_name":"Jacques Rancière","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/vhVei0u0YJ4iy7hgT5g4RD76RyW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cc1b1699251412ba1f53344","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Sloterdijk","original_name":"Peter Sloterdijk","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cc1b1710e0a260b0fecb933","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2296629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Toscano","original_name":"Alberto Toscano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cc1b179c3a3687f8f8c52bb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slavoj Žižek","original_name":"Slavoj Žižek","popularity":0.17,"profile_path":"/p7otWg1LyOF4rWpc0uWzbFIu7BU.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5cc1b183c3a368776c8d3a45","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexandra Weltz","original_name":"Alexandra Weltz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b6226d9251417c21004eeb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2296630,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"MexxTone","original_name":"MexxTone","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc1b1ae92514151cafece3b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1038108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jason Barker","original_name":"Jason Barker","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eea8a0c6dea3a0032bc21ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1793320,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jakob Stark","original_name":"Jakob Stark","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f71302093db920038a4e241","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1884351","wikidata_id":"Q638343","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7dMdikDXDhyPRukUuM1UTFR7kDp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDb","release_date":"2011-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
