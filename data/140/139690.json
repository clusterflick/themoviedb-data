At the time the film was made, there were over 3000 children living in Germany who'd been fathered by African American GIs. Referred to as \"mischlings,\" these children were often treated as outcasts because of their illegitimacy and skin color. One such mischling is Toxi (played by herself), who is sent to live with her American father when her mother dies. At first, Toxi is welcomed with opened arms, but the father, who already has two children, has neither the time nor the money to care for the girl. Toxi is then bundled off to an orphanage, sparking a serious rift in her father's family. By concentrating on a highly fictionalized plotline, Toxi tends to ignore the thousands of other mischlings whose lives are far more complex and tragic than that of the film's central character.","popularity":0.3805,"poster_path":"/kYWg3tbVFTzL1eM1vuPR7ZZ5uqA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1054,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allianz","origin_country":""},{"id":1626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fono Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1952-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toxi","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1111201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elfie Fiegert","original_name":"Elfie Fiegert","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Toxi","credit_id":"52fe4c6ac3a368484e1b71db","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Bildt","original_name":"Paul Bildt","popularity":0.1331,"profile_path":"/oiYGNyzxYJoPcEAH6AjCowrtoPl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Grossvater Rose","credit_id":"52fe4c6ac3a368484e1b71df","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Hofer","original_name":"Johanna Hofer","popularity":0.116,"profile_path":"/pIUQbxkpBl69Ix1YtOGxLvA1uB9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Grossmutter Helene","credit_id":"52fe4c6ac3a368484e1b71e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carola Höhn","original_name":"Carola Höhn","popularity":0.2765,"profile_path":"/AlRenogTA3QVL4HFUbMDGxXz3jn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Charlotte Jenrich","credit_id":"5367ec810e0a2647c8006475","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Flickenschildt","original_name":"Elisabeth Flickenschildt","popularity":0.201,"profile_path":"/ve95zh3QgOZqnFhqPnaVqY4OtU3.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tante Wally","credit_id":"5367ec910e0a2647d8006221","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Waldow","original_name":"Ernst Waldow","popularity":0.2752,"profile_path":"/vBTdvDelXbVATUlELIa9tIKeDUO.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Übelhack","credit_id":"5367ec9f0e0a2647d8006225","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erika von Thellmann","original_name":"Erika von Thellmann","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":"/pt0guA84mxxtzl4BK7Dr1N8e8JS.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Frau Übelhack","credit_id":"5367ecc30e0a2647c40063b6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katharina Brauren","original_name":"Katharina Brauren","popularity":0.202,"profile_path":"/i0H3qn8KZlrazyKpksNKf9ETkYn.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Vorsteherin","credit_id":"5367ecd20e0a2647d10060eb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lotte Brackebusch","original_name":"Lotte Brackebusch","popularity":0.1289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Frau Berstel","credit_id":"54287a3fc3a3680b1b0030f3","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willy Maertens","original_name":"Willy Maertens","popularity":0.1495,"profile_path":"/hK22c03dXXlwd6euPGbPFDaVdc3.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Inspektor Plaukart","credit_id":"59dfe87fc3a36861df0b8136","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":50564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrud Prey","original_name":"Gertrud Prey","popularity":0.1332,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Schwester","credit_id":"61cc72d09b6e4700199a2f2b","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert A.
