As a child, Anita had a tonsillectomy, during which her uvula was accidentally removed. The surgery prevents her from singing vibrato and holding long notes, but lends to her much-revered percussive style. Anita overcomes her vocal hurdle, as well as many others -- including poverty, heroin addiction and jail time for a drug arrest -- to become one of the most prolific and respected jazz vocalists of the 20th century.\r Initial release: 30 April 2007","popularity":0.465,"poster_path":"/uIWBnLlhnnrm6VK3nJwToW9ydOm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She survived it all to become one of the world's great jazz singers","title":"Anita O'Day: The Life of a Jazz Singer","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1045490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita O'Day","original_name":"Anita O'Day","popularity":0.0711,"profile_path":"/bMmX6mTBBio5bkFkWwo0qFDiZ58.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4c6fc3a368484e1b80b5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935070,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Buddy Bregman","original_name":"Buddy Bregman","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":"/njFKboikrUxXBWr5Al4Q9NGfsyB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c6fc3a368484e1b80b9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1111441,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonard Feather","original_name":"Leonard Feather","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c6fc3a368484e1b80bd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1111442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Friedwald","original_name":"Will Friedwald","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c6fc3a368484e1b80c1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9796,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Johnny Mandel","original_name":"Johnny Mandel","popularity":0.1573,"profile_path":"/35RGpMUi75TzIJsP7svkerQDvA7.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c6fc3a368484e1b80c5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":17114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cameron Mitchell","original_name":"John Cameron Mitchell","popularity":0.4642,"profile_path":"/iDyhkjtgy7U8xl9tKk9xcJA3yEY.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c6fc3a368484e1b80c9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Ross","original_name":"Annie Ross","popularity":0.1967,"profile_path":"/y2rMACd935o8jieNxoOqxpDxhb1.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4c6fc3a368484e1b80cd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1111443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Wein","original_name":"George Wein","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c6fc3a368484e1b80d1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":70983,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Whiting","original_name":"Margaret Whiting","popularity":0.1392,"profile_path":"/izpKVPBEZmd3Fm8lCSxykcmnd4y.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4c6fc3a368484e1b80d5","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":94851,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gerald Wilson","original_name":"Gerald Wilson","popularity":0.1528,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c6fc3a368484e1b80d9","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":115732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian McCrudden","original_name":"Ian McCrudden","popularity":0.0513,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c6fc3a368484e1b80b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1023123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robbie Cavolina","original_name":"Robbie Cavolina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c6fc3a368484e1b80ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0843838","wikidata_id":"Q4765594","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":986,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uIWBnLlhnnrm6VK3nJwToW9ydOm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":657}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
