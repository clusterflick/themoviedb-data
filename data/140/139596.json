Instead of the elaborately-decorated Christmas trees and presents of today, Lidia shows her grandchildren how she and her family would bring in a fragrant juniper bush and decorate it with edible ornaments (along with the recipes for those edible ornaments). It is a beautiful message of family traditions, not being wasteful, and appreciating nature.","popularity":0.2401,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11119,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tavola Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nonna Tell Me a Story: Lidia's Christmas Kitchen","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lidia Bastianich","original_name":"Lidia Bastianich","popularity":0.1592,"profile_path":"/j8Ja0i1OBGksnrveEBUYQXXDEyd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4c68c3a368484e1b6c09","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":555696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigid Harrington","original_name":"Brigid Harrington","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Julia","credit_id":"52fe4c68c3a368484e1b6c0d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Terra","original_name":"Michael Terra","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fHQXYz8ImCkTCJlYq0wA0xwrBMf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lorenzo","credit_id":"52fe4c68c3a368484e1b6c11","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":970254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Terraciano","original_name":"Tony Terraciano","popularity":0.2024,"profile_path":"/9t9FhAt0KIxA1LGTZxjQQhFxmj7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ethan","credit_id":"52fe4c68c3a368484e1b6c15","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lidia Bastianich","original_name":"Lidia Bastianich","popularity":0.1592,"profile_path":"/j8Ja0i1OBGksnrveEBUYQXXDEyd.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c68c3a368484e1b6bff","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1110924,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rachel Knobelman","original_name":"Rachel Knobelman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c68c3a368484e1b6c05","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lidia Bastianich","original_name":"Lidia Bastianich","popularity":0.1592,"profile_path":"/j8Ja0i1OBGksnrveEBUYQXXDEyd.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c68c3a368484e1b6c1b","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lidia Bastianich","original_name":"Lidia Bastianich","popularity":0.1592,"profile_path":"/j8Ja0i1OBGksnrveEBUYQXXDEyd.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c68c3a368484e1b6c21","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1806979","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
