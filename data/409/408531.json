Gary's a reclusive, middle-aged nobody, obsessed with the idea of reproducing himself. He's caught up in a hostile social climate, which furthers his isolation and exacerbates his desperation. But despite this, he presses on. Gary eventually meets Madonna, an old street woman for, as Tom McSorley of Take One Magazine calls, \"some of the most awkward and decidedly twisted sex in all of Canadian cinema.\" The film explores deep into the psyche of the protagonist, touching the viewer in more ways than one.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gary's Touch","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1541385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Takahashi","original_name":"Ken Takahashi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b63945c3a3687da50053fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0854134","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
