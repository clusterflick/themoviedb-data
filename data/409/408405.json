Emerging from her youth crippled with arthritis, Lewis escaped into her painting at the age of 30. She had never seen a work of art and had never attended an art class but her paintings captured the simple strength, beauty and happiness of the world she saw - a world without shadows.","popularity":0.07,"poster_path":"/oB093oqtvXikmixc5HQNbwFgpfn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maud Lewis: A World Without Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1657659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diane Beaudry","original_name":"Diane Beaudry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57994049c3a3683e7300127e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1657660,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patricia Kipping","original_name":"Patricia Kipping","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57994069c3a368640e007aad","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1657659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diane Beaudry","original_name":"Diane Beaudry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57994004c3a368640e007a91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0236481","wikidata_id":"Q59567566","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oB093oqtvXikmixc5HQNbwFgpfn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
