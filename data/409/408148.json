Perception journeys through the same season of time from each character's point of view, detailing how presumption and mistaken intention leads to great misunderstanding. A moment, revisited from another point of view, takes new dimension--and the line between protagonist and antagonist blurs.","popularity":0.6798,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":79718,"logo_path":"/z3fZBBTE8mekLzIIPJpTSUurwbh.png","name":"Happy Wasteland Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Look closer.","title":"Perception","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clay Adams","original_name":"Clay Adams","popularity":0.233,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Ralph","credit_id":"5796e40e9251411b2d000865","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1492195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan P.
