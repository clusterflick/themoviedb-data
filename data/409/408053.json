Through interviews with Noam Chomsky, Oliver Stone and many others, the author, Serbian-Canadian Boris Malagurski, attempts to analyze why so many people in the Balkans are disappointed with the systems imposed after the fall of socialism and how capitalism could be improved. Looking at the examples of Ecuador and Iceland, the film tries to uncover alternatives to the prevailing orthodoxies of Western economic dictates and help developing nations find their own way to shape their economies and their countries.","popularity":0.5523,"poster_path":"/wY1PmMYpF7kzovB2nbByKv74NfS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97516,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malagurski Cinema","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2014-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Weight of Chains 2","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Malagurski","original_name":"Boris Malagurski","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/lJbfvAC7uX4uglrORv8ZikqQnUv.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bc29f1292514179ae03cde7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Stone","original_name":"Oliver Stone","popularity":1.2011,"profile_path":"/nPFtjueZHmU56boVKXEvAoQOTWf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bc29f3b92514179c10393ce","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noam Chomsky","original_name":"Noam Chomsky","popularity":0.3033,"profile_path":"/yjpzdiWTGWZMf5RgHYtiJFojwaz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5bc29f4392514179c10393dc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"R.
