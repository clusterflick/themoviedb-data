Never released on DVD and, to the dismay of fans, long unavailable--these glorious Bach pieces are conducted by period instrument pioneer, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, as only he can. Harnoncourt, a notable cellist, performs in two concertos and on gamba in one. Harnoncourt warns, \"If we lose contact with the great works of Bach, we lose our contact with humanity.\" Vocalists Janet Perry, Robert Holl, and Peter Schreier sing with distinction in the Coffee Cantata. The Surround Sound makes clear that they revel in the acoustics of the visually magnificent Baroque library of Wiblingen Monastery.","popularity":0.3725,"poster_path":"/oZmypfSogHA21zXbAHnmHpIKSyO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1983-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Spellbinding","title":"Bach Brandenburg Concertos & Coffee Cantata","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225552,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nikolaus Harnoncourt","original_name":"Nikolaus Harnoncourt","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/tkitTZcuAjS98Ogz59BjYnLcovm.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"5796c71c9251417e44003146","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1118125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Perry","original_name":"Janet Perry","popularity":0.0497,"profile_path":"/ubgxUDRW8Yct0AnGHW7XIbAhAu0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5796c734c3a368734b003960","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1654964,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Holl","original_name":"Robert Holl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5796c748c3a3680d1800399f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Schreier","original_name":"Peter Schreier","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/g79szdHiNpyMZEIxqoXTagTBQQj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5796c7589251417d4a0033d5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1656635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Lindemann","original_name":"Klaus Lindemann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5796c7ea9251417e31003530","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67826,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Johann Sebastian Bach","original_name":"Johann Sebastian Bach","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":"/l8QFP8Pt4IQc4iQPvYbgIyNTEXX.jpg","credit_id":"5796c803c3a3680cfa003719","department":"Crew","job":"Compositors"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1077,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oZmypfSogHA21zXbAHnmHpIKSyO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":201055,"name":"johann sebastian bach"},{"id":227859,"name":"oratorios"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
