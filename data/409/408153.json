By gathering together to get their hair done, share stories, and support one another, they find a way to rebuild their lives. The documentary-which was work-shopped at the Salon over the course of four years-is also part of the recovery process, and the subjects of the film played an active part in shaping their own narratives and determining their unique individual styles.","popularity":0.0413,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hollywood Beauty Salon","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039287,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Glenn Holsten","original_name":"Glenn Holsten","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579b71dec3a3687ce4001500","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4722650","wikidata_id":"Q27038302","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
