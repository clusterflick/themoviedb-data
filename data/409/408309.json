Here, the protagonist named X is the personified variable in Mathematics who is suffering from schizophrenia and hence, his personality is not constant and varies. In this story, a LEAF has been considered to be a constant and X must be equal to that LEAF in order to validate language. This is an attempt to prove that Mathematics does not constitute emotions, sentiments and is comprising mere calculations; however, one's life cannot be completely manipulated.  Here, the protagonist travels through three worlds to discover himself trying to equate himself to the LEAF.","popularity":0.0687,"poster_path":"/uf5j07XmEzsS0eGrngAzjD2apPA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2016-07-15","revenue":1000,"runtime":143,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When Maths become a conversation medium","title":"The Wife's Letter","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1657282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaushik Roy","original_name":"Kaushik Roy","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":"/ePdXAgSj2yUzxC8x4ViQ3nDh0Lr.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"57986160c3a36874a80007a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1657283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sanchari Dutta","original_name":"Sanchari Dutta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"579861709251410bb3000dc1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1657284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diganta S.
