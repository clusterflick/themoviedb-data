Between the thousands of faces that tell the human inventory of the crisis, three stories intertwine unconsciously in the thin line of moral debt. Sandra, a young trans, in order to escape her past sells her fur coat. Her gaze will cross Stefanoâ€™s, a novice who just started working at the bank, and who drags her towards a tender obsession. Michele, a retired porter, asks for a loan to a family member, who will turn out to be fatally the wrong person to ask a favour from.","popularity":0.1576,"poster_path":"/mWBCvlOaUbHqTJAVpr8KYgHzx0M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2016-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pawn Street","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"The Last Things","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1076595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabrizio Falco","original_name":"Fabrizio Falco","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":"/necS4OjIA3dSyQzPTpKs1Lb2Jv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"57995bc8c3a36838a5000036","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto De Francesco","original_name":"Roberto De Francesco","popularity":0.0603,"profile_path":"/uJD4tphYchfj5gBmVEBHmu3NKmq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"57995bd8c3a36874e900834a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1657677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Andrea Rosamilia","original_name":"Christina Andrea Rosamilia","popularity":0.0624,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"57995be292514124c7004098","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alfonso Santagata","original_name":"Alfonso Santagata","popularity":0.1053,"profile_path":"/hHIXOihizxRtUBbMvx5zCVOmSik.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"57995becc3a36838a5000044","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salvatore Cantalupo","original_name":"Salvatore Cantalupo","popularity":0.0889,"profile_path":"/lcYF2lNmqxIYNa6ZTFaXODLrid3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"57995c03c3a36874e900835d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2504055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Eugenia D'Aquino","original_name":"Maria Eugenia D'Aquino","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/q889kw5MDnxBTVrJBP7tUgwhUOO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62798094d400f300500b0179","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1657676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irene Dionisio","original_name":"Irene Dionisio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57995b3d9251411461001b52","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087187,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Giorgio Gasparini","original_name":"Giorgio Gasparini","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":"/wGidrZ6wKyDkIkeKsQJtMHUxURB.jpg","credit_id":"660d7c240b5fd6017c397402","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6118296","wikidata_id":"Q29034262","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v4Dh6fyNaPE3B2ENLG57d1arEBi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/mWBCvlOaUbHqTJAVpr8KYgHzx0M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"Venice International Film Critics' Week","release_date":"2016-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Le ultime cose - TRAILER UFFICIALE","key":"1nhISDKOW4Q","published_at":"2016-09-01T11:17:31.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"57e8aad5925141395b0176dc"}]}}}
