Jung-min starts to show late-night movies at the command of the president and has been seen frequently since one day. The first time he speaks, he gets closer to Jung-min. As he gets closer to Jung-min, Choong-shik feels himself changing, and his appearance changes as well. But it feels like you are out of touch with reality. Choong-cheok ignores those feelings and decides to enjoy the moment. It is because he does not want to miss Jeong-min, who is like an angel from heaven, to Chung-sik, who has been living alone every day since his wife ran away.  Chung-sik and Jeong-min are getting closer. What is the end of those two?","popularity":0.3877,"poster_path":"/jhO6kLE9U69Hh7yqBSySrcgJ7Ug.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2016-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A hot night, a hot story begins!","title":"Raunchy Late Night Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"深夜剧场","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"야한밤 심야극장","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Raunchy Late Night Theatre","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1622390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Chae-dam","original_name":"Lee Chae-dam","popularity":2.1887,"profile_path":"/7wMyr6F3yzvbSpu2XMxSW3vObED.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60a90b877f4f210070faa60d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1767729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jang Chang-myung","original_name":"Jang Chang-myung","popularity":0.1029,"profile_path":"/3IHVgthpX38mx7s3j5FJmUXlsf8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60fbc38e96033100811c0c27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1708576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahn So-hee","original_name":"Ahn So-hee","popularity":3.0369,"profile_path":"/7OWRPTEPYi7dV5a97fhXLiiHpPM.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60fbc397848eb90086714adc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1979541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeong Min-joo","original_name":"Jeong Min-joo","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60fbc3a83d35570047233736","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1908461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Jun","original_name":"Lee Jun","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60fbc3711684f7005f04b44f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AoKNV9BlBs31J2Uy0resz8m2c6M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":950,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jhO6kLE9U69Hh7yqBSySrcgJ7Ug.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":678},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oJqKuzmV0SDWGtAnl8dbPzflBec.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":155477,"name":"softcore"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"19+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
