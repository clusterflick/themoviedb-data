At this time of year, all Parisiens are on vacation elsewhere, and the city is invaded by tourists on vacation from their own cities. In this mass rearrangement of the European population, the thieves get away with their looting until they run into an architect who catches them in the act. But his morals are nothing to brag about, as he gets more involved in what they are doing and wants some of their take. He is also smitten with one of the down-and-out women the thieves have been supporting (Dominque Laffin). As in so many French dramas, these conflicting relationships are doomed to be resolved only by tragedy.","popularity":0.3931,"poster_path":"/4nBHYWdbKAs1ZDy5OCcOKqwkIDS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passage secret","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Laffin","original_name":"Dominique Laffin","popularity":0.1313,"profile_path":"/pC454iD2kQqURwvcFdjG8DQI7mL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Anita","credit_id":"5795b912c3a3682d83001b31","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Siener","original_name":"François Siener","popularity":0.0901,"profile_path":"/eKQhrMHXQSvwvMDt1mC0sP2rF0i.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Serge","credit_id":"5795b919c3a3682d83001b35","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franci Camus","original_name":"Franci Camus","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/n1n3N2uMvawHszMi95PtGhGOlpC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Camille","credit_id":"5795b92cc3a3682d83001b3c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Dubois","original_name":"Julien Dubois","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/e3r9Y0fmSUqlll7Mj6mJXkGozCN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jeannot","credit_id":"5795b9359251412c1f006cb6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Subor","original_name":"Michel Subor","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":"/il6f0zTI3YZx6pEe13x1vEQo5eX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Enrique","credit_id":"5795b944c3a3682d83001b4d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Perrin","original_name":"Laurent Perrin","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5795b86a925141797e00a98d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Assayas","original_name":"Olivier Assayas","popularity":0.3294,"profile_path":"/yNhxilJd1QPGf1snqLtesAD7Z6M.jpg","credit_id":"5c2772aac3a3683a57d21320","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurent Perrin","original_name":"Laurent Perrin","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c27727f92514138d7beb621","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23730,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Denise de Casabianca","original_name":"Denise de Casabianca","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2772c1c3a3683a59d22331","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1435492,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dominique Le Rigoleur","original_name":"Dominique Le Rigoleur","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2772b6c3a3683a66d23326","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0089781","wikidata_id":"Q3368190","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.744,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4nBHYWdbKAs1ZDy5OCcOKqwkIDS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":595}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-07-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
