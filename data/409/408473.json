Langdon, while top-billed, also played second-fiddle to the pratfalls of Elsie Ames in \"Carry Harry\" and even soon found himself billed second to Una Merkel---yes, that Una Merkel--- in Columbia's 1944-short \"To Heir Is Human.\" Lizzy and her friend Aggie are toiling in Kelley's Laundry in order to get enough money to marry their boy friends Harry and Bill, and soon find themselves as a two-woman company bowling team attempting to keep Mr. Kelley from losing a $1000 bet. Things happen. Some of them funny.","popularity":0.1747,"poster_path":"/npcj6bqQIu4koKFEnGZ0fph8OcD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1942-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Makes Lizzy Dizzy?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1022678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Langdon","original_name":"Harry Langdon","popularity":0.1561,"profile_path":"/AuL3EB6cPn57RpdGkT3dgAqnb1s.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Harry","credit_id":"5799f42dc3a3682d4f0032c0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsie Ames","original_name":"Elsie Ames","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/1Ya1vg6MWNm4bUQNM4Y0SiqMhED.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lizzy","credit_id":"5799f43b9251413f15003229","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1062775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Appleby","original_name":"Dorothy Appleby","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/2SVGTgv49KS1XpzkW1u5DRNSBuh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Aggie","credit_id":"5799f4489251413f15003236","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monte Collins","original_name":"Monte Collins","popularity":0.1436,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bill, Aggie's Boy Friend","credit_id":"5799f457c3a36821d3002f13","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorin Raker","original_name":"Lorin Raker","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/oOJ3Oif9ZU1MaHQIs6q7ApwRTo4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mr. Kelley","credit_id":"5799f467c3a3680e4300146e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jules White","original_name":"Jules White","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/ivf31e6sR9ZynniQocdUEHV3aKv.jpg","credit_id":"5799f3c19251411325001386","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0035547","wikidata_id":"Q63498501","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.639,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/npcj6bqQIu4koKFEnGZ0fph8OcD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":690}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1942-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
