He fires one of Tony Sharkey's henchmen, scheming against the railroad, and, as a result, a fight takes place and a switching order is overlooked which nearly results in a major wreck. Realizing the situation at Hynes, Helen Barton, Vincent's sister, dashes to Hynes in her roadster and puts together a severed telegraph wire to put the station back in communications with headquarters. Meanwhile, Helen's sweetheart, Tom Lawson, is fighting with Sharkey in a run-away engine and it is headed for an open bridge over a river.","popularity":0.1732,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mistaken Orders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1072383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Holmes","original_name":"Helen Holmes","popularity":0.1313,"profile_path":"/nautzlUkBuQv5VJLL6ZjdKwNpy4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Helen Barton","credit_id":"579d587c9251411c8a0008c7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1014834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Perrin","original_name":"Jack Perrin","popularity":0.1709,"profile_path":"/iHon1YovaxeKZrLM7ouj1B4k1ng.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tom Lawson","credit_id":"579d588bc3a36828b1003219","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":955691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Tenbrook","original_name":"Harry Tenbrook","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/6fvZdgmRw8aOSdDHW6QKGLyTo00.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tony Sharkey","credit_id":"589f4cd4c3a3684fd4000012","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry A.
