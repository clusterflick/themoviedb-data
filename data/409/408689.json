He was one of the architects of the departure of President Bechara el-Khoury (1952), before playing a major role in the events of 1958. From 1960 to 1964, Kamal Jumblatt assumed, under the presidency of Fouad Chehab, various ministerial functions . . After the conflict of June 1967, he gradually approached the Palestinian organizations. In 1969 he became Minister of the Interior; in August 1970, he supported the election of Soleiman Frangié as President of the Republic. Following the Lebanese-Palestinian clashes of May 1973, he took sides against the head of state, established himself as the leader of the National Movement in 1975 and engaged in a revolutionary armed struggle against the Lebanese Front. Hostile to Syria's intervention in Lebanon, he broke with it (March 1976). He was assassinated near a Syrian checkpoint in 1977.","popularity":0.3773,"poster_path":"/e8IAgSJYUdqtBGVXGNIZiPfgUIl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99830,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lebanese National Movement, The","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greetings to Kamal Jumblatt","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1962956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kamal Joumblatt","original_name":"Kamal Joumblatt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/4CjPpZ7idmrfABknzyJm0suRDni.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself (archive footage)","credit_id":"5a613baec3a368536900ab53","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasser Arafat","original_name":"Yasser Arafat","popularity":0.1266,"profile_path":"/x80kKN9Z5AsEk4NjNHxZWAJSBV5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5a613b8dc3a368538300a97b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maroun Bagdadi","original_name":"Maroun Bagdadi","popularity":0.0999,"profile_path":"/tEAvECsyQhAiaLypsFzwVO5nILu.jpg","credit_id":"65907122ce4ddc6d907d816e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4456013,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hassan Naami","original_name":"Hassan Naami","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659071a34f9a997526770991","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":240036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maroun Bagdadi","original_name":"Maroun Bagdadi","popularity":0.0999,"profile_path":"/tEAvECsyQhAiaLypsFzwVO5nILu.jpg","credit_id":"579baf2bc3a3681584000dd4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0169969","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7PjvwdLbQzrmcWGOdbW2VJKvCwa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e8IAgSJYUdqtBGVXGNIZiPfgUIl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":230622,"name":"political struggle"},{"id":231729,"name":"humanism"},{"id":295448,"name":"lebanon"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
