The film begins with the funeral of Beethoven, at which Schubert was a torch-bearer, His story is told almost entirely in music written in the twenty months that remained to him after that date, together with quotations from Schubert's letters, diaries and the words that he chose to set in some of his songs.  Includes personal introductions by Christopher Nupen and Jacqueline du Pré and features the legendary 1969 performance of The Trout with Daniel Barenboim, Itzhak Perlman, Jacqueline du Pré, Pinchas Zukerman and Zubin Mehta.","popularity":0.2442,"poster_path":"/dKSMgTvxTp0Phjq2rslT03yKomY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":258039,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allegro Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Greatest Love and the Greatest Sorrow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Franz Schubert: The Greatest Love and the Greatest Sorrow","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Franz Peter Schubert: The Greatest Love and the Greatest Sorrow","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Franz Schubert - The Greatest Love and the Greatest Sorrow","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Franz Peter Schubert - The Greatest Love and the Greatest Sorrow","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Barenboim","original_name":"Daniel Barenboim","popularity":0.1008,"profile_path":"/pNoHzRlu3vNQmQsB7XrmrFYjOd1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"579670cec3a3680c8b000b8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1656511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline du Pré","original_name":"Jacqueline du Pré","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1Z7OANIfX3ol2l34S7siXrzVZLZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"579670dc9251417dbe000a92","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pinchas Zukerman","original_name":"Pinchas Zukerman","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/9vP6D3c89928juN8n0zDP6vDhwP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57967101c3a3680a3c000b93","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zubin Mehta","original_name":"Zubin Mehta","popularity":0.1571,"profile_path":"/yqPAUNt9QLvLSLOBcVjXboe9s5W.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"579671099251417dbe000ab6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1656347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Ashkenazy","original_name":"Vladimir Ashkenazy","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/wgESY3384x00YZgyopCEt05695T.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57967113c3a368292300b92a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1656465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Sanderling","original_name":"Michael Sanderling","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5796711dc3a368734b000ef4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Schmidt","original_name":"Andreas Schmidt","popularity":0.2017,"profile_path":"/2o5gt8z698s94p0mTccsLy6Djat.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"579671379251417e31000aad","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1656466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antje Weithaas","original_name":"Antje Weithaas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5796714ac3a3680c8b000bcc","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1569666,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Sawallisch","original_name":"Wolfgang Sawallisch","popularity":0.1928,"profile_path":"/pK9XCXV4ta4ZBDOUZtjaYeaounz.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5796715ec3a3680a3c000bb7","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":166002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Itzhak Perlman","original_name":"Itzhak Perlman","popularity":0.2687,"profile_path":"/yELJweqEW6lzEIKlZJNQbEZprD8.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57a385dcc3a368389c0002c0","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Nupen","original_name":"Christopher Nupen","popularity":0.1149,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"579670b4c3a3680d66000ab2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dKSMgTvxTp0Phjq2rslT03yKomY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
