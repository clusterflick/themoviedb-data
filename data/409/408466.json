The Earth is running out of resources and mining companies have to use increasingly low-grade metal deposits. Finland aims to be a model country for environmentally friendly mining. Its pioneer project is Talvivaara, which uses new biotechnology to extract nickel, zinc and uranium. Through several charismatic characters, the documentary film The Land Of Mine follows the rise of the biggest nickel mine in Western Europe and the ensuing disasters whose effects continue to reverberate in the nation.","popularity":0.5217,"poster_path":"/iAuVKK939xDNWB5k9cK3emKPAFj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79802,"logo_path":null,"name":"Luxian productions
