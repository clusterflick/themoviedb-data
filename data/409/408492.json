Gliding down empty streets, across the facades of once-elegant homes, entering condemned buildings, the camera makes a detached but ultimately damning portrait of civic neglect and apathy. Poignantly, human beings are rarely encountered; their presence haunts the soundtrack of eerie footsteps, an unanswered telephone, and sparse voiceover commentary from found sources.","popularity":0.0841,"poster_path":"/8FMtOd6sBQFN46lqzlzaY8a1oPp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"still/here","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1711947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Wanek","original_name":"Joel Wanek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6126b2fdad59b5002a2df743","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1657916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Harris","original_name":"Christopher Harris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2KvTTk7mWbuAzseVYdRJCBUBR79.jpg","credit_id":"6126b471d8e225002a9b8394","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1657916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Harris","original_name":"Christopher Harris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2KvTTk7mWbuAzseVYdRJCBUBR79.jpg","credit_id":"6126b2f53a9937008fd933c3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1657916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Harris","original_name":"Christopher Harris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2KvTTk7mWbuAzseVYdRJCBUBR79.jpg","credit_id":"6126b477b02f5e0046746fa7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1657916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Harris","original_name":"Christopher Harris","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2KvTTk7mWbuAzseVYdRJCBUBR79.jpg","credit_id":"579a16de925141408e0044ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3988966,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tatsu Aoki","original_name":"Tatsu Aoki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6427ac8ba3e4ba00d3ad79c4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8701182","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fgMtCn332msWc94uXh8g6NicnwW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1wTxJjlPV4u8VG5QpRMkBOD8Coh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1275,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u4CtiRtaFfv0Y8CxkYBOa1iYwh1.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":850},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8FMtOd6sBQFN46lqzlzaY8a1oPp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"The Criterion Channel","release_date":"2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
