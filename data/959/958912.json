The mothers (a teacher, a beautician, and a motorist) and the fathers (a farmer and a miner) describe years of estrangement, depression, self-harm, and suicide attempts. All these things happened until the moment of \"outing\", that is, defining one's true gender identity. In the documentary, we learn about the lives of ten transgender children. Two of them live abroad: in Germany and Canada. This global perspective shows even more bluntly how unfriendly Polish reality is for trans people. There is no support from the government in access to doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, sexologists. There is also no refund of medication and medical procedures, and no legal protection. Finally, in Poland, trans people have to sue their parents in order to have the correct gender on file. This is their everyday life.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"All About My Child\" is a story about transgender children.","title":"All About My Child","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3494108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Piotr Jacoń","original_name":"Piotr Jacoń","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624c4446a3491100686e6195","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
