Yes, there is a place called Timbuktu and it’s in Africa, in the loop of the Niger to be precise. As a child Ali never learned to read or write, but his early passion for a home-made one-string, violin-like instrument led him away from his humble roots to the music festivals of Europe in the 60’s. Critics and fans alike have compared his music to the Soul-Blues magic of greats like B.B. King, John Lee Hooker...even Eric Clapton. Ironically he had never heard their “sound” before creating his music. Amazingly, his sound is authentic Blues....and through it, we can hear the native roots, the origins of the Afro-centric rhythms found in Soul, Blues and Jazz! These Afro-centric sounds, which found their way across the seas to America during the era of slavery, preserved and transformed into modern Jazz, are the essence of Ali’s music.","popularity":0.1153,"poster_path":"/64Du1unoBSQI3Qi8XvXgnpveDTM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bambara","iso_639_1":"bm","name":"Bamanankan"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ali Farka Touré: Springing from the Roots","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Ali Farka Touré...The Blues Man from Timbuktu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ali Farka Touré","original_name":"Ali Farka Touré","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"624a421029733800a9e2f36c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3492068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henri Lecompte","original_name":"Henri Lecompte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624a428ad9f4a6006365a33e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1715319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yves Billon","original_name":"Yves Billon","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624a426a713ea60062bfe7dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0268908","wikidata_id":"Q2836209","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3SqcW51uSyw0VLyPeSnIOxoBgXo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hTKoZitRSgKL5468RCt76oZcqmh.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/64Du1unoBSQI3Qi8XvXgnpveDTM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Vancouver International Film Festival","release_date":"2000-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
