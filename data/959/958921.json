The half-siblings of Stanisław and Anna Oświęcim have been linked by love since childhood. During the feast, a conflict arises between Stanisław and Zebrzydowski, Anna's competitor. Stanisław is wounded in a duel. Anna bandages him in her room. There is a rapprochement between them. Stanisław leaves for the Vatican to obtain a dispensation from the Pope for a wedding with Anna. Meanwhile, Anna repents, misses, prays and refuses to eat. Not a single word is spoken in the movie. The mood is built by Karłowicz's music.","popularity":0.208,"poster_path":"/5IXMk3NBJkwwaQyh0hvWXo2yoFZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22089,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zespół Filmowy
