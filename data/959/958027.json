A boy, (Gavin Egger) is faced with the seemingly simple but truly complex question of reaching out for the girl's (Chloe Irwin) hand while in a theatre. With no dialogue throughout the film, this proves to be one of the most audacious and masterful works by Suing and Egger.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vOBkQavGMHClgBn3sChAJt4pqKX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It all comes down to a simple decision","title":"Purple","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3492152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gavin Egger","original_name":"Gavin Egger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Boy","credit_id":"624a5490e8a3e10062c60b0c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3492154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chloe Irwin","original_name":"Chloe Irwin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Girl","credit_id":"624a549d283ed9006328304e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3492151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cade Suing","original_name":"Cade Suing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624a54b15b2f47004ec42f46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3492151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cade Suing","original_name":"Cade Suing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624a54de5b2f4700974a6e45","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3492152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gavin Egger","original_name":"Gavin Egger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"624a54c90582240066f602b5","department":"Lighting","job":"Best Boy Electric"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vOBkQavGMHClgBn3sChAJt4pqKX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
