Set in the near future which is insulated from the polluted outside world and which is run by computers.  Made by a Miami filmmaker, Larry Kleinman, this is a starling suspense drama on the future, and ecology.  Two young boys are followed through the action of visiting a public building in which is housed exhibits of a vague nature.  The time is uncertain, the atmosphere bleak, yet as we follow the two boys our curiosity is aroused as to what they will see at the end of this provocative journey.  Useful for discussions on ecology, as well.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Function","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4803365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Kleinman","original_name":"Lawrence Kleinman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6681a5605c62514df63abbe9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4803365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence Kleinman","original_name":"Lawrence Kleinman","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6681a572649b3941533abc44","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"16mm","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
