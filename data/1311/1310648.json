The poet Werther is consumed by his passion for young Charlotte, daughter of the local magistrate—but she is engaged to his friend Albert. After several months on the road, Albert’s unexpected return will seal the tragic destiny of the troubled title character… Inspired by Goethe’s epistolary novel titled The Sorrow of Young Werther, Massenet’s operatic masterpiece returns to Vienna, the city that saw its premiere in 1892. The fabulous Bertrand de Billy leads the storied Wiener Staatsoper in a memorable performance, with Piotr Beczała—a tenor with \"the kind of voice you want to hang medals on\" (Opera News)—in the lead role.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":169,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Werther","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13832480","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
