This absurd short film follows the intertwined lives of an alluring woman, a beguiled man, and a lobster. This short film uses tropes of the Greek weird wave and the Surrealistic movements from 1930s while creating a piss-take on the power dynamics between a modern woman and man.","popularity":0.0314,"poster_path":"/rJWT0JpH4E7n7O249rlruZCzF1s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sound of Claws","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Sound of the Claws","type":"English Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4799127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Unger","original_name":"Laura Unger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"667ea618c33334c668c29d05","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4799130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christy Matthews","original_name":"Christy Matthews","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Man","credit_id":"667ea6343be6b970f9b3dac4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4799131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Animesh Garg","original_name":"Animesh Garg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ea64ccfa8ccd133c6e554","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4689639,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marion Oddoze","original_name":"Marion Oddoze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ea65ddbe7ec8f42c4ce77","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4799135,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ivan Huang","original_name":"Ivan Huang","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ea673780807f0da45f839","department":"Production","job":"Production Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4799136,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rocco Greppi","original_name":"Rocco Greppi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ea6889643b788f3dcf94b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4799131,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Animesh Garg","original_name":"Animesh Garg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ea6a250dfc7018d45f787","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4689639,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marion Oddoze","original_name":"Marion Oddoze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667ea6b24527776790b3d713","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fSQ5lSuLS4w3iPiSlPmXYcrP0nK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rJWT0JpH4E7n7O249rlruZCzF1s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
