When Pierette pours the contents of the artist’s pot of ink over herself at the end, the film seems to be spoofing Fleischer’s Out of the Inkwell series, which invariably ended with the animated clown Koko vanishing into the bottle.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1921-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Münchener Prentenboek, 1. jaargang, Nr. 9.
