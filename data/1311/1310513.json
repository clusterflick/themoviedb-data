One is Ayaka, who skipped work and arrived at the seaside with no idea where she was going. The other is Nagisa, who was born and raised in the town. Ayaka and Nagisa decide to have a drink together. Ayaka, who has built a career at a Tokyo company, feels comfortable being with Nagisa, despite their differences – Nagisa grew up surrounded by nature and she is free-spirited. Ayaka was planning to skip work for just one day, but she eventually decides to stay on for a while and she requests a leave of absence from her company. Nagisa invites Ayaka to join her at the yakitori restaurant, and together they start an izakaya where the menu changes daily. Ayaka and Nagisa go fishing and enjoy a slow, relaxing life on the beach. One day, Ayaka confesses the incident that became the reason for her absence from work.","popularity":0.5117,"poster_path":"/9Kw2WlNhINeRGdlUrnwXt1RQSyw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flowers Blooming on the Shore","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Nagisa ni Saku Hana","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"なぎさにさくはな","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1859261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haruka Kodama","original_name":"兒玉遥","popularity":0.3093,"profile_path":"/pdGHdn0vgQ8adwA2ygQtmF8jmRu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nagisa","credit_id":"66f1b93a7300a5ba213bb60b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1436261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sayaka Kaneko","original_name":"金子さやか","popularity":0.1591,"profile_path":"/meceBUyKduikVtVtDc5NW6x7Vk2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ayaka","credit_id":"66f1b95bc237258e4c26aaa1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":236718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuichi Nakamura","original_name":"中村優一","popularity":0.565,"profile_path":"/mbofhr5PTegzJbYUuiLWWbXL8eh.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Shun","credit_id":"66f1b9d57ff2bf57cd26c60b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1098324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryoma Baba","original_name":"馬場良馬","popularity":0.3784,"profile_path":"/2MCYKQWTFSnbi44L9hzv5XGEULu.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Akiyama","credit_id":"66f1ba027ff2bf57cd26c629","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hidekazu Akai","original_name":"赤井英和","popularity":0.6281,"profile_path":"/iyOWLfVdRu73vxwwf51lj0G0Evy.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tetsuji","credit_id":"66f1ba1fde2d52dfbd8d44b8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2274435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keita Matsuda","original_name":"Keita Matsuda","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66803a71cf760a75e8ef28e9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2274435,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keita Matsuda","original_name":"Keita Matsuda","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66803a6cc0482af73f5be755","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/9Kw2WlNhINeRGdlUrnwXt1RQSyw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
