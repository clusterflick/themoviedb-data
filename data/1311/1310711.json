Killing them was a heroic act. Though our wise ancestors knew that the tigers are the protector of forests, people armed with guns and brains, eliminated most of them. We ended up almost losing the forest and its burning bright mega fauna. In 1973, the Government of India launched Project Tiger, a tiger conservation program. Project Tiger takes up several measures to maintain the viable population of Bengal Tigers in their natural environment. The Forest Department workforce steps into protect the tigers and inspire people to end the tussle besides protecting themselves. The film reveals the story of the real heroes, the foot soldiers, the field staffs, who carry out their job even risking their own life but do not see themselves as heroic.","popularity":0.0839,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":30155,"logo_path":"/uBXqjnuyj05N5xefcG67wt8g7hh.png","name":"Films Division of India","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2023-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tiger Army","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Bagh Bahini","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1003010,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sourav Sarangi","original_name":"Sourav Sarangi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6680def5836423ff343657f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1003010,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sourav Sarangi","original_name":"Sourav Sarangi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6680def999c567ae38ff10a9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kolkata International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
