When their honeymoon train is derailed, Beatrice loses sight of her husband but manages to save the life of mine owner Steven Crawford. Newlands is reported burned in the wreck and Beatrice returns with Crawford to his cabin, where she nurses him back to health. Meanwhile, Newlands has escaped death and, filled with remorse, decides to make a new man of himself. Disguising his appearance by the addition of a beard, he finds work at the Crawford mine, but determines to stay out of Beatrice's life. Eventually, Newlands becomes foreman, brings law and order to the discontented miners and discovers a rich vein of ore, thus averting Crawford's financial ruin. His job completed, Newlands is about to leave when Beatrice recognizes him and begs him to give their marriage another chance.","popularity":0.213,"poster_path":"/a9DJonYW9h0KOJ791xf8851zdPg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48145,"logo_path":null,"name":"J.
