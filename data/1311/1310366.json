Instead, with little money and no friends, she finds herself sleeping in her car. Things dramatically change when she meets Rose, living in a cardboard box, and Mort, a wheelchair-bound Gulf War veteran. After first fighting over territory, these three lost souls bond in friendship, protecting and supporting each other in a story that is at once profoundly funny, heart-warming and poignant.","popularity":1.0933,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":227503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pollack Films","origin_country":""},{"id":232466,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cascade Sky
