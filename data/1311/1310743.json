These films and interstitials are studies in making maximal use of Autodesk Animator Pro and morphing software for short 2D animation output to VHS videotape, before embarking on the three-year production of Transfigured, which animated the paintings of Jack Shadbolt, as a high-resolution 35-mm film made in Animator Pro (8-bit color). The originals are all VHS videocassettes with the soundtrack added after recording the animation because .FLC files do not contain synchronized sound. Includes: Presto Agitato #1, The Recess, Area 7, Arch Rivals, Hybrid Vigour and Mountain Pass Variation.","popularity":0.1008,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stephen Arthur's Computer Animation Series: Compilation #1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3652029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen X.
