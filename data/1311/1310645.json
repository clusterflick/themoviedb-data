The film depicts a thunderstorm from what would be the last day the towers stood. That evening she left close to midnight, taking with her the mini DV tape along with some inkjet prints. The following morning during the tragic events, fellow artist Michael Richards lost his life. Seven hours of time-lapse footage have been condensed to a 5-minute document in Richards' memory.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"uno nunca muere la víspera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4802109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monika Bravo","original_name":"Monika Bravo","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6680998d4d76bd58605a5102","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
