Instead of having several musicians unsafely “uncomfortably crowd around one another” on stage like in the original version, this “COVID” version was performed by a single musician overdubbing all of the parts. Stolz uses the medium of video to present his composition in a way impossible in live performance. This version includes two electric guitars, two bass guitars, three synthesizers, drum set, found objects/percussion (wood against wood, metal against metal, and wood against metal). Completed in 2021, it was recorded and filmed in Spartanburg, SC and Belle, MO during a summer 2020 artist residency at Osage Arts Community.","popularity":0.0393,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gravitation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4800631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nolan Stolz","original_name":"Nolan Stolz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667f9b2ff36bdcc134fef3ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
