Monks of the Gelug School དགེ་ལུགས་པ་, the most famous of which is the Dalai Lama in Lhasa, were restricted to their monasteries during the previous month, supposedly to spare the lives of insects at the height of summer and, when the interdiction on movement was lifted, they would be greeted by lay people with gifts of yoghurt (zho ston means ‘yoghurt feast’). The festivities also feature the ‘sunning of Buddha’ tapestries, theatrical performances (a lce lha mo) and picnics at various public parks, including Norbu Linka, formerly the summer residence of the Dalai Lamas.","popularity":0.0536,"poster_path":"/auA6jzC2QJTj9yMNR3S5bsjGopH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83696,"logo_path":"/yzM5qWpO6dtcfGlPceGTPORFPoe.png","name":"CCTV","origin_country":"CN"},{"id":251410,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tibet Television (XZTV)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1986-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zhoston and Tibet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Yoghurt Festival of Tibet","type":"English title on VHS label"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Shoton - Tibet","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":265149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Ying","original_name":"Li Ying","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673f497099961e3a1267498f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3331106,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lu Wangping","original_name":"Lu Wangping","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674c06450911241392f05a9e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5093187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yi Huimin","original_name":"Yi Huimin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674c88230d99b44361e028bd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5093187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yi Huimin","original_name":"Yi Huimin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674c9ed5386283927de02107","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5093356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhang Ziyang","original_name":"Zhang Ziyang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674c9eef386283927de0211f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5093360,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Qiang Ba","original_name":"Qiang Ba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674c9f2c1616b4a858c7c0ca","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4024033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yueying Zhang","original_name":"Yueying Zhang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674c9f4d6bfb98c974ef6907","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5093364,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lu Bin","original_name":"Lu Bin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674c9f676bfb98c974ef691a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34794160","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1502,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/auA6jzC2QJTj9yMNR3S5bsjGopH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1986-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
