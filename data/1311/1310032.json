We can feel unease every day through the confrontation with presumed poverty and desperation. The news camera is not neutral; intentionally or unintentionally, those who are filmed are framed as victims. Before they know it, the social conscious viewer is dragged into a vortex of guilt and shame. With the large scale video installation Guilty Landscapes Verhoeven brings the reality of uncomfortable news images confrontingly close. He poses the question of whether a personal connection is possible between the viewer and the person being viewed. What if the news were to turn and look at its witnesses; what if the protagonists on the evening news were to look us in the eye?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guily Landscapes, episode 1 - Hangzhou","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4799181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dries Verhoeven","original_name":"Dries Verhoeven","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667eafb97803cd0f492a6d97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
