A First Nations carver from Canada travels into the jungles of Papua New Guinea and a New Guinea carver travels to urban Canada. Together, they share each other's cultures and learn about the myths and legends that inform their individual artistic styles. In the Spring of 2006 John Marston, a young Coast Salish carver from Vancouver Island who has already gained a strong reputation for his innovative approach to traditional Coast Salish styles, visited Teddy Balangu, a carver from the Sepik River of Papua New Guinea. Teddy returned to Canada where he was the artist in residence at the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia for 5 months.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Killer Whale and Crocodile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3041829,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Campbell","original_name":"Peter Campbell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606db0d69ca75900409dc191","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1252563","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
