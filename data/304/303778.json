An imaginary journey throughout Europe tracing  cartography of the ruin, a melancholic voyage through time, a look at fingerprints and trace, absence, stone and dust. To experience the silver film as wall experiences the passing of men and time, in search of fracture, a breach where only it survives, among the ashes and the debris, a blind light wave travels a wasted land.  There is no bond that time does not erase.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tabula Rasa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sébastien Cros","original_name":"Sébastien Cros","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5469b412eaeb816b55002c9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sébastien Cros","original_name":"Sébastien Cros","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60466e4584f249004588242e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1590432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carole Arcega","original_name":"Carole Arcega","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/7LepEFrruJX9TqvamTGGr1odYmL.jpg","credit_id":"60466dc9d8e225006f3a1543","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
