Volume 9: God Speaks!","overview":"Get ready for some big-time adventure as we look at the books of the Prophets, the home of famous stories like Daniel in the lion’s den, Jonah’s fish tale and a fiery furnace that is no match for three godly guys named Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego! In God Speaks! [Isaiah, Jeremiah & the Prophets], take a whirlwind trip through the 17 major and minor prophets, and learn all about their messages for God’s people. Isaiah kicks it off with his hopeful prophecies and promises, while prophets like Jeremiah issue dire warnings, reminding the Israelites not to stray from God. Other prophets, like Ezekiel, go to crazy lengths to communicate God’s messages to his people, and Jonah learns that trying to run from God can land you in the belly of a big fish. Meanwhile, God protects Daniel from some hungry lions and helps Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego keep their cool when things heat up.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/4whKS4Rm5wRaFcsNYYVn9aO9bAI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Isaiah, Jeremiah, & The Prophets","title":"What's in the Bible?
