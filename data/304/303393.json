With some help from the Narrator and lots of imagination, Busy Little Engine and his friend, Pig, have a lot of fun learning about what trains do all day. Gentle transitions, uncluttered visuals, and the loveable Pig draw viewers in to the simple adventures of Busy Little Engine and Pig as they explore the world through role-playing and imagination. Familiar sights and sounds mixed with magical animations inspire children to join-in, naming farm animals, singing-along with Pig, and recognizing new things in their daily lives. Just like a parent reading to a child, all the characters and sound effects in the story are voiced by one person.","popularity":0.0875,"poster_path":"/P0wyBFDDtdMavdOFzqmqLy3Syd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":211992,"logo_path":null,"name":"Squirrel Tracks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Busy Little Engine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4339994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Busy Little Engine","original_name":"Busy Little Engine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6539c42e24f2ce00e26a800a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4339996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorrie Guess","original_name":"Lorrie Guess","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Prologue","credit_id":"6539c450955c65011be0e7c1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4339998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desmond Mullen","original_name":"Desmond Mullen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6539c45f678259013cd0c495","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4339999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pig","original_name":"Pig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6539c48dec4552012c19eab6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4340002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheep","original_name":"Sheep","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6539c49dec4552014d6e7a8c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4339998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desmond Mullen","original_name":"Desmond Mullen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539c4dcb87aec00abd341b0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4339998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desmond Mullen","original_name":"Desmond Mullen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539c4f08a0e9b012ca20cd2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4339998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desmond Mullen","original_name":"Desmond Mullen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539c51a091e6200e1bb6534","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4339998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desmond Mullen","original_name":"Desmond Mullen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539c4c7b87aec0137a99330","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4340006,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jimmy Magoo","original_name":"Jimmy Magoo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539c52624f2ce00ad7e8d23","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4339998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desmond Mullen","original_name":"Desmond Mullen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539c53f091e6200fec61fd5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4340005,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Helena Mullen","original_name":"Helena Mullen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539c508b87aec00abd341dc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4339998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desmond Mullen","original_name":"Desmond Mullen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6539c556091e6200fec61fec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0807746","wikidata_id":"Q7720762","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7jQSTfDVPKk85OQQzFy8cVBscWe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/P0wyBFDDtdMavdOFzqmqLy3Syd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
