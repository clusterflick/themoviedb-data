Amenaide, the daughter of Argirio, leader of the senate, is in love with the exiled knight Tancredi. Argirio offers Amenaide's hand in marriage to Orbazzano, the leader of a rival faction, as a token of reconciliation. Amenaide resists this and sends a letter to Tancredi, who is back in Syracuse in hiding. The letter is intercepted, and it is mistaken as an invitation to the Turk Solamir to enter Syracuse. Amenaide is sentenced to death for treachery, but Argirio allows a champion to fight for her vindication... will her beloved Tancredi save her? Bernadette Manca di Nissa, Maria Bayo, and Raul Gimenez star in this Rossini opera with Gianluigi Gelmetti conducting the Radio Symphony Orchester Stuttgart.","popularity":0.2256,"poster_path":"/yhTfyFcPwxxE8X6v0Uyv7nni9kY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26664,"logo_path":"/tmdslqWvUZVJoSmVD142vpD6845.png","name":"Teatro alla Scala","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":19492,"logo_path":null,"name":"ArtHaus","origin_country":""},{"id":71996,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schwetzingen Festival","origin_country":""},{"id":210,"logo_path":"/cuIR8m2nnKkqPgnQz25FJT26aBa.png","name":"Süddeutscher Rundfunk","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1992-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":166,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tancredi (1992) Schwetzinger Festspiele.
