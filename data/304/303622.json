WILD BOAR is a poetic, and visually arresting documentary about the curious relationship between man and the rise of the wild boar. The film tells a story about confusion, despair and opportunity amidst the invasion of unruly creatures that wonâ€™t abide by manmade rules and laws. From the dark woods where it originates, this almost uncontrollably dangerous creature goes deeper and deeper into our villages and cities but at the same time tickles our imagination and inspires us. WILD BOAR is an exploration of a society conflicted with nature and a reflection of the curiosity of human nature itself. Will we eat them or will they eventually devour us?","popularity":0.0778,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":38477,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zuidenwind Filmprodukties","origin_country":""},{"id":22294,"logo_path":"/xD7TJlNqBQM6KmdWyr22TUK1rCt.png","name":"NTR","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2013-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In Nature, Only One Rule Counts; Eat or Be Eaten...","title":"Wild Boar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385781,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Willem Baptist","original_name":"Willem Baptist","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5468300e22136e1e1c00178a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385781,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Willem Baptist","original_name":"Willem Baptist","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5468302222136e560f000366","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261646,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dirk-Jan Kerkkamp","original_name":"Dirk-Jan Kerkkamp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54683063eaeb8118bb001850","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261646,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dirk-Jan Kerkkamp","original_name":"Dirk-Jan Kerkkamp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5468308f22136e1e1c0017a1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261646,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dirk-Jan Kerkkamp","original_name":"Dirk-Jan Kerkkamp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5468309ceaeb817dc4000d14","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261646,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dirk-Jan Kerkkamp","original_name":"Dirk-Jan Kerkkamp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546830abeaeb810130000b18","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385782,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeroen Goeijers","original_name":"Jeroen Goeijers","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/aKHPq2SRbsKtqzaNQ2e3889zKDV.jpg","credit_id":"546830c522136e1e1c0017a4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1385782,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeroen Goeijers","original_name":"Jeroen Goeijers","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/aKHPq2SRbsKtqzaNQ2e3889zKDV.jpg","credit_id":"546830e3eaeb817dc4000d24","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385783,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Barend Onneweer","original_name":"Barend Onneweer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5468312f22136e1e1000183d","department":"Editing","job":"Color Timer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385784,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rob Maas","original_name":"Rob Maas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5468313d22136e1e1300170a","department":"Crew","job":"Post-Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385785,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nienke Korthof","original_name":"Nienke Korthof","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5468314a22136e1e13001710","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385786,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joost Seelen","original_name":"Joost Seelen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5468315d22136e1e0e001922","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385787,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Oscar van der Kroon","original_name":"Oscar van der Kroon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54683170eaeb8118bb001876","department":"Crew","job":"Commissioning Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3417964","wikidata_id":"Q16919794","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"WILD BOAR (trailer)","key":"hYsgNiWI_gE","published_at":"2013-08-19T08:01:49.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5468d4e3eaeb816b480010c5"}]}}}
