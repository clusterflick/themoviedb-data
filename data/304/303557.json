Using a jar of sprouting Mung beans as a metaphor it takes into consideration contemporary manifestations of national borders as they relate to regional and international growth and movement. This video emerges from questions such as: Who gains access? How does water transform a space and its borders? Who can move freely and access resources? What moves in and out of a given space and the boundaries that attempt to demarcate and contain it?","popularity":0.3212,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GD","name":"Grenada"}],"release_date":"2014-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bottleneck","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385691,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Malaika Brooks-Smith-Lowe","original_name":"Malaika Brooks-Smith-Lowe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54679595eaeb8118c40004fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385691,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Malaika Brooks-Smith-Lowe","original_name":"Malaika Brooks-Smith-Lowe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546795c4eaeb8118b40004c3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385691,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Malaika Brooks-Smith-Lowe","original_name":"Malaika Brooks-Smith-Lowe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546795d722136e1e0e000519","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3734388","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":189599,"name":"beans"},{"id":208618,"name":"jar"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
