We discover that the witches who run this salon (another female played by Elina Bellbrook and a male witch) must make this sacrifice every thirty years, but they must find a virgin who was born on a certain date at a certain time  The movie jumps ahead 30 years, putting us in modern times â€“ in which, as I'm sure you're aware, a virgin is very hard to find But one day stunning blonde Janet Fontaine (played by Elizabeth Grace) comes waltzing into the salon, and the witches finally have their prime candidate. Fortunately for Janet, she has a boyfriend (and a frustrated one, given the fact that Janet's a virgin!) who is looking out for her better interests. The question is: will he be able to unravel the mysteries of the salon before the witches seduce Janet into becoming their next victim?","popularity":1.8668,"poster_path":"/cjrZlpTxh2GQxVe4Fj52vqhftKO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1331,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seduction Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Witches of Sappho Salon","video":false,"vote_average":2.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1385941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Grace","original_name":"Elizabeth Grace","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/iXRXOPi1NTuFz7M3ykUgOt7Vco0.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Janet","credit_id":"5468c001eaeb816b58000c0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Eves","original_name":"Brigitte Eves","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Tanith","credit_id":"5468c09feaeb816b55000e04","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elina Bellbrook","original_name":"Elina Bellbrook","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Bridget","credit_id":"5468c0c222136e68c7000d57","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1480754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tre Temptor","original_name":"Tre Temptor","popularity":0.0883,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":28,"character":"Jerry / Leon","credit_id":"61a5a5ef0582240042b406c7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":98973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Marsiglia","original_name":"Tony Marsiglia","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5468c0ea22136e68da000c73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98698,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bruce G.
