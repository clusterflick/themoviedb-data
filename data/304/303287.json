Two years after witnessing the brutal murder of his mother and being displaced, he has returned to his childhood home while on a backpacking trip for troubled youth. Micah finds his father's mining claim and enters the tunnel, where he helps himself to something inside the mine. It's his after all, isn't it? But a Native American ghost, the beautiful and alluring Angel of Shavano, appears to him, demanding her treasure back. He takes it anyway, and bad things begin to happen... very bad things. Two decades later, our main character has sought refuge in a hostel in Montana, where he gets help for terrible nightmares he has been having since his childhood. Upon learning about the death of his father, he returns to Colorado, and that's when things begin to heat up as he is hunted down by the Angel of Shavano.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angel of Shavano","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
