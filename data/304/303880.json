The film shows moving visual patterns in vibrant, entrancing colours – dark fluorescent pinks, blues and purples ­– overlaid with stirring lines that recall a heart monitor, and which have been translated from radio waves emitted by the Big Bang. By playing sound frequencies alongside these visuals, as well as eerie recordings of disembodied voices talking about their experiences with extraterrestrial phenomena, Hiller’s installation conjures a hypnotising world of magic and possibility that is difficult to leave or forget. By sitting down to watch and listen, the audience taps into a mental experience that facilitates meditation on the extraordinary and the uncanny.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resounding (Infrared)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Hiller","original_name":"Susan Hiller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546a5599eaeb816b58003c15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
