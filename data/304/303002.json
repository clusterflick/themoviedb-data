Though each served a number of years in the ministry, each is now an avowed atheist. Calvin King grew up in a Midwestern Mennonite home and spent thirty years as a Mennonite pastor. Annalise Fonza was raised Roman Catholic, attended the Baptist Church, studied to be an attorney, but was eventually ordained a United Methodist minister. Teresa MacBain is the daughter of a conservative Baptist pastor who worked in prison ministry, elder ministry and in a drug rehab program before serving United Methodist pastorates in North Florida. Rich Lyons comes from an Episcopalian background but spent twenty years as the pastor of a United Pentecostal Church in East Texas.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Path Less Taken: From Ministry To Non-Belief And Beyond","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
