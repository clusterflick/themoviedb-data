Instead the ongoing success of this mighty collective is based on raw undiluted talent, a knack for composing penetrating and gloriously anthemic music and the kind of common decency and fairness that music fans appreciate. This documentary film celebrates the music and career of Pearl Jam as it traces their journey to the top and beyond. With the aid of rare footage, archive interviews, contributions from their closest collaborators, and comment from the finest rock writers, this programme is all set to become the standard work on a band who remain torchbearers for the great American rock tradition.","popularity":0.5289,"poster_path":"/fnvCuMaq4BgTrSZfDeh0K7vPk2E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary film","title":"Pearl Jam: See No Evil, Hear No Evil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Vedder","original_name":"Eddie Vedder","popularity":0.5308,"profile_path":"/26yDfC30UvaYHwVvfl61q3dokYo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64d56231f14dad013a8aa029","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stone Gossard","original_name":"Stone Gossard","popularity":0.1746,"profile_path":"/eOzop1Yhx1vVXA7xkuksPPAAks6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64d56236bf31f201cb68f5b8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike McCready","original_name":"Mike McCready","popularity":0.1937,"profile_path":"/dVz5KWgeifIfJwlmhGBA7OixXoE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64d5623bd100b601395bf709","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Ament","original_name":"Jeff Ament","popularity":0.1019,"profile_path":"/uPavu55MOQEEqgjA0rVpsoKlZDB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64d56240f495ee02942ea578","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Cameron","original_name":"Matt Cameron","popularity":0.233,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64d56245bf31f201ccbd7c57","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fnvCuMaq4BgTrSZfDeh0K7vPk2E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11700,"name":"rock music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
