The United States is the only country in the world that routinely condemns children to die in prison. This is the story of one of those children, now a young man, seeking a second chance in Florida. At age 15, Kenneth Young received four consecutive life sentences for a series of armed robberies. Imprisoned for more than a decade, he believed he would die behind bars. Now a U.S. Supreme Court decision could set him free. 15 to Life: Kenneth's Story follows Young's struggle for redemption, revealing a justice system with thousands of young people serving sentences intended for society's most dangerous criminals.","popularity":0.0802,"poster_path":"/yovjztiuvfDJ22xxVHcvZdQ0bF9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Do teenagers deserve life without parole?","title":"15 to Life: Kenneth's Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261366,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nadine Pequeneza","original_name":"Nadine Pequeneza","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58dac17c92514155fc0011d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261366,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nadine Pequeneza","original_name":"Nadine Pequeneza","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58dac185925141565b0011fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3215812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yovjztiuvfDJ22xxVHcvZdQ0bF9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"(Florida Film Festival)","release_date":"2014-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
