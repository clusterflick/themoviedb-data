It's Monday and they announce to a group of youngsters that they have five days to get up on stage and dance. A short time but a big challenge. The dance compels these youngsters to break through their roles exactly at the time of their lives when the social roles are being forged. The handsome boy is no longer the most admired, the timid one takes a step forward. Wilfried van Popple and Amaya Lubeigt are the choreographers. Professional dancers who have decided now to work with people who have never danced before. This is the challenge: five days, a class of teenagers, a microcosm in which occurs a little big bang.","popularity":0.0778,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2014-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Five Days to Dance","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafael Moles","original_name":"Rafael Moles","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5469bd9d22136e68d5002b1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Andreu","original_name":"José Andreu","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5469bd9022136e284f000afe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3742486","wikidata_id":"Q54913357","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jWPedQETe6uDb2wuhXkcBkh3ZXh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1422}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
