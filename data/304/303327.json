But, he's not the only one. He discovers that other people in his neighborhood have been experiencing the same fear. . . and people are coming up missing. His obsession with this fear leads him to an anthropologist, Dr. Branson. Dr. Branson claims this innate fear is the result of thousands of years of terror from a creature that exists only in the dark--a DARKLING. Adrian's girlfriend, Helen, isn't convinced and hooks him and some of their friends up with a psychiatrist, Dr. Kailee Jenkins, who takes them to a remote cabin to cure them of their \"phobia\". A story of fear and the effects that it has on its victims and their loved ones.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Darkling","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3604020","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
