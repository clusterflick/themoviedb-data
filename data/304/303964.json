Gregg had been HIV positive for 24 years and during that time the side effects of the medications made him increasingly sicker than the virus itself. In the last several years he felt that his quality of life had diminished considerably, so he choose to go off his meds and no longer fight death.  After giving away all of his belongings, Gregg buys an RV and travels across the United States with his dog, Cody, saying goodbye to family and friends who have to come to terms with Gregg's decision: That rather than suffer a long, painful death, he will end his own life before allowing the progressing illness to take away his independence.","popularity":0.3363,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":38723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greenie Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How Would You Say Goodbye?","title":"A Finished Life: The Goodbye & No Regrets Tour","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregg Gour","original_name":"Gregg Gour","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"546acc8592514101e90008aa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386522,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michelle Boyaner","original_name":"Michelle Boyaner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546acb9692514101e9000882","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386523,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Green","original_name":"Barbara Green","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546acc42c3a3680d690009da","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386523,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Green","original_name":"Barbara Green","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546acbae92514101e9000889","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386523,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Green","original_name":"Barbara Green","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546acbd992514101ec0008bb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386524,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michelle Garuik","original_name":"Michelle Garuik","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546acc0392514101e900089e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386522,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michelle Boyaner","original_name":"Michelle Boyaner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546acbbd92514101ec0008b7","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386525,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Meghan Toohey","original_name":"Meghan Toohey","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546acc1cc3a3680d7800094c","department":"Writing","job":"Musical"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386522,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michelle Boyaner","original_name":"Michelle Boyaner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546acc6dc3a3680d690009e0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386523,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Green","original_name":"Barbara Green","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546acbee92514101e900089b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1272037","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":740,"name":"aids"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":208666,"name":"dignity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
