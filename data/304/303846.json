A man flees Buenos Aires with a bag full of money and with every intention to repay the debt he owes his brother, with whom he has lost touch with years prior. The journey towards the Pantanal becomes complex as the man runs into various complications and begins to believe that someone may be following him.  As visually stunning as it is intellectually stimulating Pantanal employs documentary testimonies of the people who encountered the man throughout his journey, adopting real life into the fictional narrative. Working within a hybrid between fiction and documentary keeps the film both captivating and engaging throughout the film’s entire journey, in addition to adding emotional credibility to this road movie.","popularity":0.0636,"poster_path":"/7gHee5GmP3IyJVUY4i9yAgPUIe9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151039,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmabonito","origin_country":""},{"id":151040,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sala Cine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Guarani","iso_639_1":"gn","name":""},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pantanal","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonardo Murúa","original_name":"Leonardo Murúa","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Andrés Cáceres","credit_id":"6053829ac433ea00abb7ad09","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386372,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joaquín Neira","original_name":"Joaquín Neira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62113f3403f0b6004231ade4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158742,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Sala","original_name":"Andrew Sala","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546a1f57eaeb814540000aaf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158742,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Sala","original_name":"Andrew Sala","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546a1f4922136e4551000520","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158742,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Sala","original_name":"Andrew Sala","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546a1f6722136e68c9003c63","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386374,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lautaro Aichenbaum","original_name":"Lautaro Aichenbaum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546a1fc722136e68cf0038ab","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1141088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francisco Forbes","original_name":"Francisco Forbes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546a1f7ceaeb816b46003705","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1141088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francisco Forbes","original_name":"Francisco Forbes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546a1fd7eaeb816b58003696","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386370,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucía Tebaldi","original_name":"Lucía Tebaldi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546a1f8ceaeb816b4b003740","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386371,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Manuel Forbes","original_name":"Manuel Forbes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546a1f9deaeb814540000ab5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386376,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicolás Pucci","original_name":"Nicolás Pucci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546a1ffc22136e284f001570","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1386373,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrés Tambornino","original_name":"Andrés Tambornino","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/nmFOcdmzkuzfvhBj1fpC27YkMDT.jpg","credit_id":"546a1fb722136e4551000534","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3168942","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7gHee5GmP3IyJVUY4i9yAgPUIe9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":699}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
