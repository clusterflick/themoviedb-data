She is the other gaze is a collaboration with five female visual artists of an older generation who have been part of the Viennese art scene since the 1970s and engaged in the women's movement. In dialogue with the filmmaker Renate Bertlmann, Linda Christanell, Lore Heuermann, Karin Mack and Margot Pilz share their early works and artistic practices. They remember how their self-determination evolved between artistic ambitions, economic constraints, adaptation and resistance to the prevailing patriarchal social structures. In their role as feminist pioneers, the protagonists are a great influence on the contemporary art scene and the self-understanding of younger artists today. With their voices and narratives, they become collaborators passing on feminist thinking and artistic experiences.","popularity":0.0738,"poster_path":"/oMXEUvCPiinzenasgfhUDutTqNn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67822,"logo_path":null,"name":"sixpackfilm","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2018-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She Is the Other Gaze","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2320156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renate Bertlmann","original_name":"Renate Bertlmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"herself","credit_id":"5ce77e040e0a265256d6c634","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Christanell","original_name":"Linda Christanell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"herself","credit_id":"5ce77e170e0a26522ad0705f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2320157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iris Dostal","original_name":"Iris Dostal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"herself","credit_id":"5ce77e2ac3a3682a9c1e1cb9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2320158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lore Heuermann","original_name":"Lore Heuermann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"herself","credit_id":"5ce77e340e0a263c7ec9f53f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":126229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karina MacKenzie","original_name":"Karina MacKenzie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"herself","credit_id":"5ce77e43c3a3682a9c1e1cc1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2320159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margot Pilz","original_name":"Margot Pilz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"herself","credit_id":"5ce77e4fc3a3683bd823d32a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2320155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christiana Perschon","original_name":"Christiana Perschon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hXrjHU9nu15jveLjQ8Eiv0PMajX.jpg","credit_id":"5ce77e759251414923be7953","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2320155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christiana Perschon","original_name":"Christiana Perschon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hXrjHU9nu15jveLjQ8Eiv0PMajX.jpg","credit_id":"5ce77ddf0e0a263aedcc193e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2320155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christiana Perschon","original_name":"Christiana Perschon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hXrjHU9nu15jveLjQ8Eiv0PMajX.jpg","credit_id":"5ce77e6c0e0a26522ad0708b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2320155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christiana Perschon","original_name":"Christiana Perschon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hXrjHU9nu15jveLjQ8Eiv0PMajX.jpg","credit_id":"5ce77e5e9251415450ba86a1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2320160,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christiana Perschon","original_name":"Christiana Perschon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce77e82c3a368536b22c35a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11508218","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oF0B5UXEZNlTxuNTyDum49ztmn4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1190,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oMXEUvCPiinzenasgfhUDutTqNn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":170487,"name":"essay film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
