There is nothing simple about Catherine Saalfieldâ€™s Infidel, however, as the film uncovers and repositions layers of myth about female beauty, the function of racism in standardizing our ideals, and the necessity of female self-consciousness in a scheme that demands both conformity and uniqueness. Partly autobiographical, and partly extracted from collective experience, this jumpy, tightly crafted narrative reconstructs the process behind the formulation of self-image.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Infidel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1860251,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Saalfield","original_name":"Catherine Saalfield","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cea476f0e0a261bcfcc4497","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
