More than fifty years ago, plans surfaced for constructing a dam, which residents have steadfastly opposed. Villagers who want to protect a hometown blessed with abundant nature and clean water have been pitted against a mighty power. Rather than focus on the opposition movement, this film turns its sights on the lives of people now bound together like family in their coexistence with nature.","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":"/zgc7morazFZ7n0g9CsWnnVbsAvh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2018-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Protectors Of Firefly River","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1957558,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dodo Arata","original_name":"Dodo Arata","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce71961c3a36863a823a759","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1424240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eiji Yamada","original_name":"Eiji Yamada","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce71869c3a3683bd8233290","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"savekobaru","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"hotaruriver"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kyy8yBwqW2ZyDkhBFOWKtbm9ePj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zgc7morazFZ7n0g9CsWnnVbsAvh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"劇場版「ほたるの川のまもりびと」 予告編","key":"rk5fz8002Tg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-04-23T06:45:52.000Z","id":"5ce71b14925141479bbe0cce"}]}}}
