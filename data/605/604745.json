Broods a little, but who doesn’t. Occasional political activity. He never really grasped why Wendel, his best friend for years, had left. Just took off. The fool. Emigrated.

They spend the day together.","popularity":0.1047,"poster_path":"/gALlHNWDFwiRoqeL4aXz2kX1kuK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wendel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":49446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Buser","original_name":"Daniel Buser","popularity":0.3147,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"671a1496e833d92ef05fd645","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4373900,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kriton Kalaitzides","original_name":"Kriton Kalaitzides","popularity":0.1229,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"671a149d34c0fabd681c57b8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5018802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilo Wicki","original_name":"Lilo Wicki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"671a14a4fefd1e0510ffe469","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Schaub","original_name":"Christoph Schaub","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/tnXoNBoWXqc4yJNZRj19AqG5QEc.jpg","credit_id":"5cea19b10e0a26643fcbf37e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0094306","wikidata_id":"Q1653079","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gALlHNWDFwiRoqeL4aXz2kX1kuK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
