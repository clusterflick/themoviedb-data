The figure of Joachim Knychala, who murdered five women between 1975 and 1982, is used to focus our attention on those whose lives were marked by the infamous 'vampire from Bytom'. Among them there is a former journalist, Edward Kozak, who, despite his old age, admits he has a variety of obsessions. The film about the 'vampire' offers him an opportunity to enter the limelight one more time.","popularity":0.0912,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":54734,"logo_path":"/kywbYYwd2xgXFGeaSqQQVAZeuqv.png","name":"Lightcraft","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":30161,"logo_path":"/h6dniliQm3tgLXBggnXz5u0KpF9.png","name":"Krakowskie Biuro Festiwalowe","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2013-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lust Killer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1610284,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Daniel Markowicz","original_name":"Daniel Markowicz","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661860550f0da50163dea7c7","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcin Koszałka","original_name":"Marcin Koszałka","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ceb0e2f0e0a261a50cc49fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcin Koszałka","original_name":"Marcin Koszałka","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ceb0e4b0e0a261a50cc4a08","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1055087,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anna Wagner","original_name":"Anna Wagner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ceb0e540e0a266683cdf170","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1889616,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michał Sosna","original_name":"Michał Sosna","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cdf8cd59ae03efe32a8b63","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3614350","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
