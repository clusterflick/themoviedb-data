Within this twilit demi monde, which may be entirely a figment of the dandy’s own fevered imagination, clothes take on a heightened importance: as prized commodities and as treasured, almost talismanic objects. This closed circuit of desire and display turns increasingly claustrophobic, as if tracing a compulsive, repetitive groove in the protagonist’s mind; culminating, in a self-consciously solipsistic flourish, in a cool 360-degree pan round the walls of Leckey’s flat.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parade","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1390062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Leckey","original_name":"Mark Leckey","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/2CV4C9cnL0KAQjRKRUORq6dmb2g.jpg","credit_id":"5ce855fd925141479bbfd719","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
