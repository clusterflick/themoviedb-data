Using both the urban landscapes of New York and images of the American road from Maine to California as visual correlatives for Lethem’s books, the film suggests the array of cultural influences that inform the author’s life and work.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/aNZ4mqwwj5V3x66aJDPr10znubv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lethem","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2320466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Barney Taylor","original_name":"Fred Barney Taylor","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce82df59251414923bf5d82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2405,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aNZ4mqwwj5V3x66aJDPr10znubv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1804}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
