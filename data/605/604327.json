The towering sculpted columnar walls and roof were long held to be man-made, or created by giants, or held up as proof of a divine creator. One myth suggested that the cave was the abode of a nine-headed sea monster, another that the Devil himself were buried beneath the island. The last inhabitants of Staffa, around 1790, left the island after the pot on their stove shook so violently during a storm one night, that they believed “nothing but the devil could have shook it that way.” It can be a wild, moody and inhospitable place.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3ZG4XXKCyW8IDvj8OU30Dcwgl54.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fingal’s Cave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2111789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Ashrowan","original_name":"Richard Ashrowan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce736c30e0a265ac0d030cf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2111789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Ashrowan","original_name":"Richard Ashrowan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce736d4c3a3682a9c1dc1ea","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2111789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Ashrowan","original_name":"Richard Ashrowan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce736bdc3a3686a1c244c1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2111789,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Ashrowan","original_name":"Richard Ashrowan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce736ca0e0a263aedcbabc8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ZG4XXKCyW8IDvj8OU30Dcwgl54.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
