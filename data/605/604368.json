Their exploration of the bleak urban surrounds of 1980’s London, powerfully evoke the desires and tensions of its disillusioned youth alongside their own eccentricities. Poetic narration combines with vivid imagery that moves between the startlingly beautiful, the humorous, and the absurd. Church spires and city streets, youth and drunks, dancing and tea-drinking all take on an affecting symbolism when viewed from the unique perspective of Gilbert & George.","popularity":0.1149,"poster_path":"/nroST94vFjHvuDgeq0cM9zS5GaF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27901,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council of Great Britain","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1981-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World of Gilbert & George","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1651315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Passmore","original_name":"George Passmore","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"605d0c9a8c31590075962754","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2320177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilbert Prousch","original_name":"Gilbert Prousch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"(as Gilbert Proesch)","credit_id":"605d0ca346f354003c5ca13e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Haas","original_name":"Philip Haas","popularity":0.0905,"profile_path":"/ejZkqudQcMsNTY126047kQ76xiJ.jpg","credit_id":"605d0c61f3e0df00275af39c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67044,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Martin Schäfer","original_name":"Martin Schäfer","popularity":0.1483,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605d0c7e988afd0053502c40","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085511,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Heather Holden","original_name":"Heather Holden","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605d0c857614210028a2ef04","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1651315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Passmore","original_name":"George Passmore","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605d0c8dfed5970054535d83","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2320177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilbert Prousch","original_name":"Gilbert Prousch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605d0c928f26bc005599155e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1651315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Passmore","original_name":"George Passmore","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce797d09251415450baa4a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2320177,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilbert Prousch","original_name":"Gilbert Prousch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce797d70e0a263aedcc3948","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1864554","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nroST94vFjHvuDgeq0cM9zS5GaF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":717}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
