Mascha, in her mid-30’s, worked as a television editor for years before dropping out to make two self-financed and unexpectedly successful theatrical films. At the moment, she is taking a break – she’s run out of ideas. Her plight is made worse by her boyfriend Frank’s unsympathetic attitude. He is a head of production, from a working class background, an unscrupulous career man, and won’t tolerate an unsuccessful woman around him. In the midst of this exasperating mess, Mascha meets the ‘’wolf girl’’, Dennis, a young black rebel who works as a cleaner in a theater. The girl fascinates Mascha and she finally breaks her long, loveless relationship with frank so she can spend more time with Dennis. The two women move in together: Mascha because she wants to turn the simple ‘’wild’’ Dennis into a more sedate person, and Dennis because she has secret hopes of finding human warmth and shelter.","popularity":0.0695,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1984-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolfgirl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Wolf Girl","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Wolf's Bride","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1286822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Imke Barnstedt","original_name":"Imke Barnstedt","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mascha","credit_id":"5eeed1442e2b2c00366be471","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2685774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martine Felton","original_name":"Martine Felton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Dennis","credit_id":"5eeed159ed2ac200329c8614","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lothar Lambert","original_name":"Lothar Lambert","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":"/ag2DGaXYYosYpRCKQp6mBp5lLzD.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Kurtchen \"Marilyn\"","credit_id":"5eeed1806f6a990037cc1405","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Heins","original_name":"Albert Heins","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Frank","credit_id":"5eeed25d2e2b2c00356bd31d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1481486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mustafa Iskandarani","original_name":"Mustafa Iskandarani","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Rajab","credit_id":"5eeed31710dad60031be1f44","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57801,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christian Sievers","original_name":"Christian Sievers","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ee41979ac535018533f61a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1288679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dagmar Beiersdorf","original_name":"Dagmar Beiersdorf","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce9d65b9251416a3fba1a6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1706039,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Albert Kittler","original_name":"Albert Kittler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eeecfe76f6a990037cc129f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lothar Lambert","original_name":"Lothar Lambert","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":"/ag2DGaXYYosYpRCKQp6mBp5lLzD.jpg","credit_id":"5eeed02cb0cd200036b6c70e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2685763,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pete Wyoming-Bender","original_name":"Pete Wyoming-Bender","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eeecf9e2e2b2c00366bda67","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1288679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dagmar Beiersdorf","original_name":"Dagmar Beiersdorf","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eeeced7ed2ac200359c4985","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0088413","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
