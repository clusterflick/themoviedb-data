Tim has walked out on Katherine after finding her in bed with a younger man. Victor, possessive and longing for commitment, has been thrown out by his older lover, Neal. Both Tim and Vic seek solace in a café, where Vic overhears Tim confiding in a friend about his breakup with Katherine. When Tim leaves, desperate and a little drunk, Vic follows him home. Though they are strangers, he manages to talk his way into Tim’s apartment. Once inside, Vic claims to be a recruiter for the devil, willing to return Katherine in exchange for Tim’s soul. Angered, Tim suspects this is just a tasteless prank and demands that he leave. But what appears to be a “prank” leads to murder.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Recent Sorrows","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Barrish","original_name":"Jerry Barrish","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce8e78c92514159e9bc99bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9558700","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
