Koreans in Osaka strongly resisted, and 16-year-old Kim Taeil was even shot and killed by the police. This was the Hanshin Education Incident. 70 years have passed, but the Japanese oppression continues. They've removed the Chosen gakkoō from being eligible for free education. Gaining strength from the growing hatred from the conservatives, the Abe administration is misusing the educational issue as a means to cause political strife. In the midst of ongoing conflicts in Japan, nonfiction writer KO Chanyu has directed Korean Schools in Japan, compiling a history of the Koreans' fight for education.","popularity":0.2238,"poster_path":"/yglF8SDbLrfF8rH5zz2chaRzZt1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Korean Schools in Japan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2322442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ko Chanyu","original_name":"Ko Chanyu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ceb5061925141522bbc7a6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yglF8SDbLrfF8rH5zz2chaRzZt1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":682}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":270709,"name":"zainichi"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
