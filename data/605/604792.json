Although she is indeed educated, she can't get a real job in her profession due to the current situation on the job market. When she is once again unemployed after a short deputy job, she decides to attend to her situation herself - she is starting her own business. Whilst not having any real money to begin with, she turns to the government's employment agency to apply for a grant to start her own company, a service available in special circumstances in Sweden.","popularity":0.4347,"poster_path":"/3C392GMUGSfk0iTapCWCygAB9YW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2005-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Recognize and Realize","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Se och inse","type":"alternative spelling"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2321763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Byström","original_name":"Clara Byström","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Julia Eriksson","credit_id":"5cea6cb1c3a368539d1e9e5e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2263972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ola Citron","original_name":"Ola Citron","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ove N.
