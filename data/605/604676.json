In an act of post-socialist urban cosmetics, the Prussian imperial castle is re-emerging from the ruins of state socialism at the historical center of Berlin. In this arena of continued ideological overwriting, Kerstin Honeit reenacts a Cold War trope from West German popular TV: Der Internationale Frühschoppen ran from 1952 to 1988 as a morning talk show for political debate (almost simultaneously to the existence of the GDR). Juxtaposing architectural and television production, my castle your castle engages and critiques the building site as a stage for crafting ‘nationhood’ and (white) ‘masculinity.’","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/bmEBwwMrsmttWs3wY98id4zPitq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"my castle your castle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2321361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kerstin Honeit","original_name":"Kerstin Honeit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce9bc980e0a2661d1cb7d4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bmEBwwMrsmttWs3wY98id4zPitq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
