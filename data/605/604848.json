I film to remember: the end of a summer, of a family, a last trip to Vermont before a separation, grandparents getting older.... I film impromptu, dissolving and fading in the camera. At night I hand-develop the film in a beaker. It sticks together and stains, leaving traces and holes that only add to the nostalgia. I leave the film as is, adding only some improvised music, which by its minor harmonies and discordances goes well with the faded, stained pictures.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/pjpg2uQqoaBNZ7O1FFteq5M7esx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"End Memory (Impromptu)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932643,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pip Chodorov","original_name":"Pip Chodorov","popularity":0.0864,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ceac284c3a368539d1f5bd5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932643,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pip Chodorov","original_name":"Pip Chodorov","popularity":0.0864,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"601ee31b700bf700415b9f4d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pjpg2uQqoaBNZ7O1FFteq5M7esx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
