Alexander Khanzhonkov, the most prominent Russian film producer of that era, financed a special department dedicated to non-fictional cinema, despite the fact that such films were not commercially successful. Unfortunately, not a single copy of the film has survived to the present day. All that remains are 12 frames, which were used by Izvolov to create this reconstruction. He also used extracts from critical reviews, published at the time of the film’s release, to produce a soundtrack.","popularity":0.2399,"poster_path":"/fdaZmlvhbgtjAQqRuGxFnLbee6G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24060,"logo_path":null,"name":"A.
