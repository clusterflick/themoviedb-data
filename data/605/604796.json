We follow Greta and the organisers of the school strikes for climate as they are cementing a worldwide movement ahead of their first global protest that took place on March 15th, 2019. It was the biggest climate strike in history with up to 1.6 million students in more than 125 countries.","popularity":0.4748,"poster_path":"/ALclMBXq1xVmtJd29QZUBrIWS8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17209,"logo_path":"/khOQX3iJuSmaFWrL3w4LijbtnJZ.png","name":"VICE Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Skipping school to save the planet","title":"Make the World Greta Again","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Climate Crisis: Make The World Greta Again","type":"SBS on Demand Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2297949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greta Thunberg","original_name":"Greta Thunberg","popularity":0.3173,"profile_path":"/r4qHgSvuVk79NOCy4vyqpPbXkpg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5cea6f11c3a36856981fea9b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2321792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luisa Neubauer","original_name":"Luisa Neubauer","popularity":0.1424,"profile_path":"/THRjDeivn3vPekgATKUuGCGWLD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5cea72600e0a26643fcc7f9b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2321808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Taylor","original_name":"Anna Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/eFElxNJuX2xurkG322a5BxfxVUS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5cea75c492514175e8baf827","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2321811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scarlet Possnett","original_name":"Scarlet Possnett","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/mmFB0w57zW4VMk7dORuRvhowd0t.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5cea75de92514175e8baf872","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2321814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anuna De Wever","original_name":"Anuna De Wever","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/20kQRzh66rzrmSD6v8xM2bJIB5i.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5cea761f0e0a266683ccb3db","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grant Armour","original_name":"Grant Armour","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cea82769251416a3fbb381a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grant Armour","original_name":"Grant Armour","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cea8381c3a36827b81ee9be","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1354113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grant Armour","original_name":"Grant Armour","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cea838ac3a36827b81ee9c6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2321904,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milène Larsson","original_name":"Milène Larsson","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cea83cdc3a3681c4e20d850","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2321904,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milène Larsson","original_name":"Milène Larsson","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cea83dc9251416a3fbb3a6d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2321907,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ben Melbourne","original_name":"Ben Melbourne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cea84570e0a261bf2cb1675","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10404884","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qxsz4ZIB16cowyCv1TekxJWwXlc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":1389,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ALclMBXq1xVmtJd29QZUBrIWS8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":989}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2210,"name":"climate change"},{"id":5769,"name":"global warming"},{"id":254028,"name":"climate breakdown"},{"id":254779,"name":"climate strike"},{"id":254781,"name":"climate change activism"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":311826,"name":"climate crisis"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Skipping School to Stop Climate Change: Greta Thunberg and the Student Protests","key":"oCVQdr9QFwY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-05-24T12:00:08.000Z","id":"5cea7b57c3a368547f21327e"}]}}}
