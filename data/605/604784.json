But his provincial family is determined to break up the scandalous affair.  Filled with passionate and beautiful music – including the famous duets ‘Libiamo ne’ lieti calici’ and ‘Un dì, felice, eterea’ – it’s easy to see why Verdi’s tragedy about a fallen woman has become the most popular opera of our time. Prix de la critique Claude Rostand winner Oriol Tomas directs this new production at Icelandic Opera.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/8QS8wFZ98mm1Gk9i14SAVdSmqs6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Traviata - Icelandic","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2321725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herdís Anna Jónasdóttir","original_name":"Herdís Anna Jónasdóttir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5cea5f0b0e0a26643fcc5d4e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2156260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elmar Gilbertsson","original_name":"Elmar Gilbertsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5cea5f139251416a3fbaf88e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2321727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hrólfur Sæmundsson","original_name":"Hrólfur Sæmundsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5cea5f1d0e0a266683cc88aa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2321729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hrafnhildur Árnadóttir","original_name":"Hrafnhildur Árnadóttir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5cea5f249251414398b8df25","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2321730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sigríður Ósk Kristjánsdóttir","original_name":"Sigríður Ósk Kristjánsdóttir","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5cea5f2b0e0a261bcfcc6e76","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2321732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Snorri Wium","original_name":"Snorri Wium","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5cea5f32c3a3682e9320dbf1","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2321733,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bjarni Frímann Bjarnason","original_name":"Bjarni Frímann Bjarnason","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cea5f42c3a368539d1e8949","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2321735,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oriol Tomas","original_name":"Oriol Tomas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cea5f4c9251416a3fbaf8c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2652,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8QS8wFZ98mm1Gk9i14SAVdSmqs6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
