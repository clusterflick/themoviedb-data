It is a wild mosaic of startling imagery including a safe-sex foot fucking scene with toes in a condom, a woman flasher, and a woman voyeur in a wheelchair who comments on the street life near a public toilet. Desert of Love is a challenging, highly original work from one of Germany’s most exciting gay talents.","popularity":0.1082,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desert of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lothar Lambert","original_name":"Lothar Lambert","popularity":0.0681,"profile_path":"/ag2DGaXYYosYpRCKQp6mBp5lLzD.jpg","credit_id":"5ce9befb0e0a2661d1cb81e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0264794","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
