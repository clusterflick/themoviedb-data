The site was named after the amount offered by the natives to buy this war material out, brand new but already outdated. The film Million Dollars Point juxtaposes the images of this submarine battlefield with footage of a local music video showing a French mustached man dancing and singing on a Pacific beach with Polynesian girls at his side.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7xQpI3nJ3UrVNdPfdxfVIAuXaHx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Million Dollars Point","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486809,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camille Henrot","original_name":"Camille Henrot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/eQsi9mIFaqWTdFyi2UEMqFNlcur.jpg","credit_id":"5ce51459925141479bbaeadc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7xQpI3nJ3UrVNdPfdxfVIAuXaHx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
