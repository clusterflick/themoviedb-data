Or are they – as WG Sebald describes – alien structures denuded from human history?  The first collaboration between filmmaker Luke Fowler and acclaimed sound recordist Chris Watson. Enceindre is a study in film and sound of two 16th century fortified cities: Berwick in the North-East of England and Pamplona in the Navarre region of the North of Spain.  The film considers the wider psychological and social resonances of what it means to live within a town defined by its historical complex of defensive walls and bastions. By adopting an “infra-sensitive” approach to place; Enceindre draws on overlooked acoustic perspectives and lucid camerawork to propose a new framework in which to consider these anachronistic structures.","popularity":0.0818,"poster_path":"/xe3UKEQpPpHXGebscMwmU48E94s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enceindre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2145875,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Watson","original_name":"Chris Watson","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cf77c6cede69005901f0ca","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Fowler","original_name":"Luke Fowler","popularity":0.0636,"profile_path":"/5cu30pcHXQAfgmmdGg1O49sNxEH.jpg","credit_id":"5ce6fe940e0a265cdecedaff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14891202","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":898,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xe3UKEQpPpHXGebscMwmU48E94s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":598}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Punto De Vista International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2019-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berwick Film & Media Arts Festival","release_date":"2018-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Edinburgh International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
