Attentive to details of body and sexual language, songs, indications of each interlocutor’s erotic imaginary, the film tries to sketch a portrait of the ”male” they identify with. Patterns emerge, as do norms, but also an unsuspected map of Beirut’s sites of sexual encounters.","popularity":0.0479,"poster_path":"/j9Tbz4fAE6qDaGYRZOELfcv1WFj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crazy of You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akram Zaatari","original_name":"Akram Zaatari","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"550e9e62c3a3683f39002317","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j9Tbz4fAE6qDaGYRZOELfcv1WFj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
