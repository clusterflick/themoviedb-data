A narrator tells us about a young woman who wants, more than anything, to be a ballerina. Thanks to animation, we see the problem: her legs make up about three-quarters of her height. She sees the impossibility of her dream and moves to a house on an isolated hill where she lives by herself, lonely, practicing her art, and then, in near despair, taking up knitting. Madness seems close at hand, but is there anything that can bring hope and pull her from her solitary, circumscribed life?","popularity":0.2518,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":202410,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kent Richards Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":53921,"logo_path":null,"name":"Krátký film Praha – Studio Jiřího Trnky","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Toll Collector","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El peaje de la soledad","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Tull och tyll","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die einsame Ballerina","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Ypallilos diodion","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1445931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Johnson","original_name":"Rachel Johnson","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"648df702559d2200c5766fcb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1445931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Johnson","original_name":"Rachel Johnson","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5513faa9c3a36841030010f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1445931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Johnson","original_name":"Rachel Johnson","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648df6b926346200ae1baedc","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1445931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Johnson","original_name":"Rachel Johnson","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648df6ccc3c891012d5d89ad","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Otting","original_name":"Joe Otting","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648df6e3c3c89100ae50d5d2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006691,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrick Kirst","original_name":"Patrick Kirst","popularity":0.0769,"profile_path":"/9B0sK1b6BdHZVrflsYj6lkRbRcP.jpg","credit_id":"648df711263462010cbbb3fd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0351852","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6511,"name":"alone"},{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"},{"id":187256,"name":"ballerina"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2003-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
