Namdok, battered by wind and cold has been in darkness for centuries. Wearing Ray Bans to shield his eyes from the dust and just a leather jacket to insulate him from the bitter cold he surveys the village. He grew up in this region without electrical power. He is determined to bring lights to Namdok in an effort to prove himself to the skeptical village community. Tashi's Turbine is a character driven film that shows the impact of one man's dream for light, in a village waiting for development.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/1AvNVw8JCjVj3dxryPxZn6KjuCF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tashi's Turbine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1858391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amitabh Raj Joshi","original_name":"Amitabh Raj Joshi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5978b43f925141756d011b68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1858392,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Kruth","original_name":"John Kruth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5978b46d9251417537011330","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1858391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amitabh Raj Joshi","original_name":"Amitabh Raj Joshi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5978b47dc3a36860b0012916","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4344906","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"tashisturbine","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1406,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3wkxapzmjtVlz6iKdZFw3ulk7K7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1AvNVw8JCjVj3dxryPxZn6KjuCF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
