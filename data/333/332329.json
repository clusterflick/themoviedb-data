For that reason, among others, it is not recommended for newcomers. The more experienced, however, will certainly get the \"challenging, athletic workout\" the tape promises. Instructor Lisa Bennett is cheerful as she conducts a vigorous series of sun salutes, balancing poses, back-bends, hip and abdominal poses, and such; you'll keep moving almost constantly, and if breaking a sweat is your goal, you can't go wrong here. The overall tone, however, is rather like an infomercial, which could become irritating over repeated viewings.","popularity":0.0536,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yoga Zone - Power Yoga for Strength and Endurance","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1945234","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
