The first part for the city, the second tries to live as its ancestors develop and the third integrates one of the new agricultural cooperations. \"A pastoral society (1,500,000 inhabitants) on the threshold of decisive choices, destructured by the evolution of economic relations which lead to the concentration of herds in the hands of a few, to the support of rangelands and to the movement of impoverishment and proletarianization of the greatest number. The attitudes of the protagonists occur in relation to the economic and political involved in the process of agrarian revolution. The alternative lies only in the free adherence of small breeders to the forms of economic and social reorganization of the Agrarian Revolution and their insertion in the profound movements of social and political change that affect Algerian society.\" Sid Ali Mazif","popularity":0.1492,"poster_path":"/q9u6W2EU0RU4TyGQGbNzu7RGKWW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139395,"logo_path":"/4NXn9zAMa8SH9zZnYPmt6okp6VM.png","name":"Office National pour le Commerce et l'Industrie Cinématographique (ONCIC)","origin_country":"DZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"}],"release_date":"1976-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nomads","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","title":"مسيرة الرعاة","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","title":"مسيرة الرعاة","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SA","title":"مسيرة الرعاة","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","title":"مسيرة الرعاة","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TN","title":"مسيرة الرعاة","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"LY","title":"مسيرة الرعاة","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","title":"مسيرة الرعاة","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"MR","title":"مسيرة الرعاة","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545672,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed Chouikh","original_name":"Mohamed Chouikh","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":"/3ZDUJec00CnJbEJIwVTR193zxuk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"550ed0c7925141073d002c3f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hassan El-Hassani","original_name":"Hassan El-Hassani","popularity":0.1677,"profile_path":"/rRzwTCZUR9prihYwcsimzxJgeiq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"550ed0cf9251410701002c18","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3442650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahmed Kada","original_name":"Ahmed Kada","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64888f9d7ef3810104a5b81d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4109793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohamed Gueldasni","original_name":"Mohamed Gueldasni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"648890646f8d95011f23998e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339993,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rachid Merabtine","original_name":"Rachid Merabtine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6251c10991b53000a96cee40","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1433183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sid Ali Mazif","original_name":"Sid Ali Mazif","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/nBQIN6wWE7LLkwdHOlGaKd3tHHy.jpg","credit_id":"550ed0b792514146a0009fd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1433183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sid Ali Mazif","original_name":"Sid Ali Mazif","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/nBQIN6wWE7LLkwdHOlGaKd3tHHy.jpg","credit_id":"64888f29e27260010723f80c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4109790,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lamine Bechichi","original_name":"Lamine Bechichi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64888f356f8d9500c88b5368","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339995,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nouredine Touazi","original_name":"Nouredine Touazi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64888f42e375c000c529a95b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0856250","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/heyf88eIK2PrDear4Bs3OMVLPAM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q9u6W2EU0RU4TyGQGbNzu7RGKWW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.748,"height":1192,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/47K7hBx6PAzO8JqePdiW4ms5ihr.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":892},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gRMlPELLVYOOub252u99FbF91Nh.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":293245,"name":"maghreb"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
