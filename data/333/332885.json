I was twelve years old… I've been here for 60 years.\" A beautiful, poignant documentary, Still Life examines the effect a collection of personal photos showing life in Palestine before the 1948 displacement have on an elderly Palestinian fisherman living in exile in Lebanon. The importance of place and memory in preserving a people's history are crucial to Diana Allan's illuminating documentary. In, Said Ismael Otruk, a Palestinian man born in Acre in the 1930s, recalls his childhood and the halcyon days of his youth. His memories, not always accurate, so he relies on the photographs he managed to take with him. They are images of young boys, of the port, of fishing boats and the sea. On one, he reads a note he wrote many years ago: \"Acre and Said in the Golden Age.\"","popularity":0.3141,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":33427,"logo_path":null,"name":"SEL","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Allan","original_name":"Diana Allan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"551555f3925141070100cc11","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Allan","original_name":"Diana Allan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"551555d59251412c52002818","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Allan","original_name":"Diana Allan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"551555e7c3a3686195004afc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":211385,"name":"sensory ethnography lab"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
