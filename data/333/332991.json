Filmed over a twelve-month period, it follows the seasons on the mountain from spring lambs through to winter snows. The contributions of the British Mountaineering Council and National Trust volunteers make clear the crucial importance of maintaining the landscape quality of England's highest peak for future generations.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/j9wMyqt0R6dnwrYSKWTcA0xFlfB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"England's highest mountain as seen by its farmers, climbers and conservationists.","title":"Life of a Mountain: A Year on Scafell Pike","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5288498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alison O'Neill","original_name":"Alison O'Neill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Shepherdess","credit_id":"67cacad0f708440336cb5e0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5288504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julius Manduell","original_name":"Julius Manduell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67cacb19aa523c748a2b52dc","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2959728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terry Abraham","original_name":"Terry Abraham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cacbe836598226a1afddb1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3743318","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qt29THbeQuoVy6eLPtlVTOldEBu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j9wMyqt0R6dnwrYSKWTcA0xFlfB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"OFFICIAL EXTENDED TRAILER - 'Life of a Mountain: Scafell Pike'","key":"-k-DUZivB8c","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-07-30T14:44:03.000Z","id":"67cac96baa523c748a2b522d"}]}}}
