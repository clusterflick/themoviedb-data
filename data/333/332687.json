A young woman named Julie momentarily offers a glimpse of the unseen. She is a paradox of fragility and brutality, of woman and child. Through a variety of circumstances the characters find themselves trapped in a world of lies and manipulation they are all taking part of. For Julie the line between fantasy and reality blurs. However in the casting sessions she finds something that she apparently needs. As all her defenses break down, it reveals what is the deepest and the most hidden in the young girl. A modern portrait of the ego and the human longing for recognition.","popularity":0.2269,"poster_path":"/nhSXHsK5FNTx5HoBdT7f7nh1djp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silhouettes","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":139820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pom Klementieff","original_name":"Pom Klementieff","popularity":1.7227,"profile_path":"/hfUKAI2kXTMMWjno0i4sLPJud5N.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Valerie","credit_id":"5513c24ec3a368351e000310","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1275591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Boujenah","original_name":"Laura Boujenah","popularity":0.2324,"profile_path":"/swwUMnCpNLyhIOCpUfYk9PePvpi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Laura","credit_id":"67bceaba0a3b05c495a479be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Ullmann","original_name":"Nicolas Ullmann","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":"/2aLZGJQhYH8SB5meQpyeLd6QXy1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Yvan","credit_id":"67bceadae050d9b8b3999b25","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1893007,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nicolas Imbert","original_name":"Nicolas Imbert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nico","credit_id":"67bceb034d940b124ba478df","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah-Lou Lemaître","original_name":"Sarah-Lou Lemaître","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nastya","credit_id":"67bceb334d940b124ba478ed","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1291172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Céline Menville","original_name":"Céline Menville","popularity":0.2469,"profile_path":"/aZYWdBE0V6U3FwyKXcYtfxDiPEu.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Celly","credit_id":"67bceb52e050d9b8b3999b71","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2806762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Hurez","original_name":"Charles Hurez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Charly","credit_id":"67bceb65e050d9b8b3999b76","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1142226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helene Ruys","original_name":"Helene Ruys","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Delphine","credit_id":"67bceb777cbc485ba4999ddf","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1867288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Chabat","original_name":"Louise Chabat","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":"/pBlnHvuYuSQGzSnivp36NjDQQWT.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Monica","credit_id":"67bceb8ae050d9b8b3999b86","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1425955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amandine Maugy","original_name":"Amandine Maugy","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/korab2G1jw1TkIH981DQSlBhZMw.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Hotel Maid","credit_id":"67bceb9e472875122ba47765","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1939171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Strittmatter","original_name":"Nadine Strittmatter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67bcebd5a1e6fb93c26be6ac","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1664544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alison Arboux","original_name":"Alison Arboux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Aston","credit_id":"67bcec030a3b05c495a479ea","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4550693,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mayia Alleaume","original_name":"Mayia Alleaume","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"67bcec13a1e6fb93c26be6ee","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1445794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lars Knorrn","original_name":"Lars Knorrn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5513c230c3a3684239000dbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1988785","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1623,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nhSXHsK5FNTx5HoBdT7f7nh1djp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1082}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
