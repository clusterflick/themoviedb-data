The charges, when collated and then heard in court 50 years ago, told the story of the Jewish Holocaust to the entire world in a way that it had not been told before. This changed the collective Israeli consciousness forever. Bureau 06 tells the personal stories of this team of investigators; their hardships, their confessions and the emotional turmoil they experienced, together and alone. Among these is the story of Avner Less, Adolf Eichmannâ€™s interrogator who left Israel after the trial and took back his German identity card.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bureau 06: The architects of the Eichmann Trial","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
