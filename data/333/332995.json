But that history is bunk. The real pioneers of space exploration were the Soviet cosmonauts.  This remarkable feature-length documentary combines rare and unseen archive footage with interviews with the surviving cosmonauts to tell the fascinating and at times terrifying story of how the Russians led us into the space age. A particular highlight is Alexei Leonov, the man who performed the first spacewalk, explaining how he found himself trapped outside his spacecraft 500 miles above the Earth. Scary stuff.","popularity":0.4495,"poster_path":"/imM8pUcLJimpQySjY5sneJRSJU3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cosmonauts: How Russia Won the Space Race","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Космонавты: как Россия выиграла космическую гонку","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Kosmonauten - Helden im All","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul McGann","original_name":"Paul McGann","popularity":0.7532,"profile_path":"/4NAtQI30CAaJuQRiot9twe7J9t9.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator (Voice)","credit_id":"5515cf2bc3a36821e5001469","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Lachmann","original_name":"Michael Lachmann","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5515d00cc3a36861950052af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331818,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Lachmann","original_name":"Michael Lachmann","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5515d002925141538d00163c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446358,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Neil Kent","original_name":"Neil Kent","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5515cf4f925141538d001628","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446361,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebecca Lavender","original_name":"Rebecca Lavender","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5515cfad9251410462003dc8","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446359,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andy Hopkins","original_name":"Andy Hopkins","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5515cf609251412be40030fa","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446362,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gerard Evans","original_name":"Gerard Evans","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5515cfcac3a36841f30035bd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1446360,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Evih Efue","original_name":"Evih Efue","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5515cf9d9251412cec002f6e","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1251308,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jonathan Renouf","original_name":"Jonathan Renouf","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/eTKluwvipvlemR5kPBKHRWyg2AT.jpg","credit_id":"5515cfdfc3a36821e500146d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4482288","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/imM8pUcLJimpQySjY5sneJRSJU3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vU5EvbDQRcCKzzCmrdzdNCRWMGS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":667},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yuzbnwrqjauXW7LjN9w5dv6dDfA.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2111,"name":"soviet union"},{"id":9882,"name":"space"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
