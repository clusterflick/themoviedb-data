In the first miniature, Schmitt films graves from the American Indian Wars as silent witnesses of a past that have left their traces on the collective American consciousness. Subsequently, we see blackandwhite street scenes in Hollywood, which are followed by almost familiar images â€“ a garden bench, a bouquet of flowers. Thus history, the public and the private form a new, abstract and yet tangible unity.","popularity":0.1841,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":49185,"logo_path":null,"name":"LEE ANNE SCHMITT","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1283827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Anne Schmitt","original_name":"Lee Anne Schmitt","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/nq3ZozJfW4aY7jXCePYywmVLNzT.jpg","credit_id":"550e921492514146a0009615","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1283827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Anne Schmitt","original_name":"Lee Anne Schmitt","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/nq3ZozJfW4aY7jXCePYywmVLNzT.jpg","credit_id":"550e91ec9251413554007320","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1283827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Anne Schmitt","original_name":"Lee Anne Schmitt","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/nq3ZozJfW4aY7jXCePYywmVLNzT.jpg","credit_id":"550e9205c3a3683f39002118","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":387,"name":"california"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
