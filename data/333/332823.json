An anthropologist, author (her most recent book is \"Refugees of the Revolution: Experiences of Palestinian Exile) and filmmaker, Diana Allan documents the experiences of the Ibrahim family, who have been making a living as fishermen for generations. The film looks at their relationship to work and to the physical environment and how they've persevered in this â€˜temporary' home.  Produced at Harvard's Sensory Ethnography Lab, Terrace of the Sea is a haunting work, a meditation on the process of memory and on the distances between photography and film, land and sea and - between seeing and being seen.","popularity":0.1332,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":33427,"logo_path":null,"name":"SEL","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2009-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terrace of the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Allan","original_name":"Diana Allan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5514c35ec3a36821e5000405","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
