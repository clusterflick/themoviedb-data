Accompanied partly by a down-pitched version of Pink Floyd’s 1971 concert played “to the dead” at Pompeii, the work has an unsettling, morose quality.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/x4iVbXU25b0bULxJpbRaFhkTa6B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49234,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rachel Rose","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Minute Ago","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1443833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Rose","original_name":"Rachel Rose","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":"/ec0Na1yBCHEq96lUgWZrn5tfdCh.jpg","credit_id":"550f0550925141469900a3ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1443833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rachel Rose","original_name":"Rachel Rose","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":"/ec0Na1yBCHEq96lUgWZrn5tfdCh.jpg","credit_id":"550f056f9251416bd1000d28","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1680,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x4iVbXU25b0bULxJpbRaFhkTa6B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1120}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
