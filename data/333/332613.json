The curse is called 'mingi' and mingi children are killed. Lale Labuko, a young educated man from the Kara tribe was 15 years old when he saw a child in his village killed and also learned that he had 2 older sisters he never knew who had been killed. He decided one day he would stop this horrific practice. Filmed over a five year period we follow Lale's journey along with the people of his tribe as they attempt to change an ancient practice.","popularity":0.4117,"poster_path":"/gIKC7u6x7NFY5yO8GAsqJCbkYYc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61179,"logo_path":null,"name":"Little Pass Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ET","name":"Ethiopia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Amharic","iso_639_1":"am","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Omo Child: The River and the Bush","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lale Labuko","original_name":"Lale Labuko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"55d39f16c3a36819c300000f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Rowe","original_name":"John Rowe","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d39ba092514120160006d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498085,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tyler Rowe","original_name":"Tyler Rowe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d39bcc925141200500068d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498085,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tyler Rowe","original_name":"Tyler Rowe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d39bdb925141200c000704","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498086,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matt Skow","original_name":"Matt Skow","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d39befc3a3683b7e000701","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498087,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eric Poline","original_name":"Eric Poline","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55d39c0d925141200a0006af","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4151098","wikidata_id":"Q23755493","facebook_id":"Omo-Child-The-River-and-the-Bush","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"OmoChildMovie"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cFr4caILEPgqeQo2zbSpJ2e0yfe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gIKC7u6x7NFY5yO8GAsqJCbkYYc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":941,"name":"tradition"},{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":6156,"name":"superstition"},{"id":9826,"name":"murder"},{"id":10541,"name":"curse"},{"id":160588,"name":"ceremony"},{"id":217370,"name":"mingi"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
