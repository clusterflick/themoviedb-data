The movie is narrated by Liu Lin and consists of 9 stories. Based on the essence of real life, it breaks the creative framework of documentary and drama films, combines the popularization of intangible cultural heritage with the stories of inheritors through poetic shots, explores the boundary between reality and fiction, and uses reality as the needle and philosophy as the line to outline a life picture where recording and narrative are both external and internal.","popularity":0.3138,"poster_path":"/fLw5JBqIDRv9wnMMDcj9iUI73SR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2024-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gift Of Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2227790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liu Lin","original_name":"刘琳","popularity":0.5353,"profile_path":"/zTwp8XHRHwQHiko0vWYbLZzAKD3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"661e1436b84cdd017d63f66d","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/fLw5JBqIDRv9wnMMDcj9iUI73SR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Beijing International Film Festival ","release_date":"2024-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
