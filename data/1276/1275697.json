She is creating an exhibition called THE RAVE ARCHIVES. The exhibition is about the culture surrounding rave music. This Audio-Visual piece is 'Lost Media' - an old VHS tape lying around to be found once again by its owner, who is now able to relive days long gone from when they were involved in the rave scene in the 90's. The footage showcases the underground scene that celebrated youth culture and acceptance, but still has a sinister edge to it that the rave scene will always be associated with due to the heavy use of drugs. The owner and the viewer are disrupted as the footage cuts out, only for the footage to play on a loop once again, similar to the nature of raves themselves.","popularity":0.1075,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Lost Media: History of Art & Museum Studies Exhibition-THE RAVE ARCHIVES","title":"LOST MEDIA","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4658074,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Frankie Pivaro","original_name":"Frankie Pivaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661fd5f220af77017d3f79ef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
