It's a simple question and it sounds like it has a simple answer. But do we really know what it is that we're asking? He investigates the concept of time, exploring its origins and its limits, and questioning whether travelling through it will ever be possible.  Brian visits the ancient Mayan pyramids in Mexico where the Maya built temples to time. He finds out that a day is never 24 hours and meets Earth's very own Director of Time. He journeys to the beginning of time, and goes beyond within the realms of string theory, and explores the very limit of time. He discovers that we not only travel through time at the speed of light,but the experience we feel as the passing of time could be an illusion.","popularity":0.4039,"poster_path":"/gaiNiajUtb472SzApfaJr7wF0CU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"time","title":"Do You Know What Time It Is?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Cox","original_name":"Brian Cox","popularity":0.3498,"profile_path":"/98WBXqXKoOKbXi3rjupcp1vz17F.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"661e437f3c4344017c02d69f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":93484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Olding","original_name":"Paul Olding","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661e43603c4344017c02d680","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2760294,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Doug Bryson","original_name":"Doug Bryson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661e43d21cfe3a017d9b2a1f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1332825","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ivHgfp9P45NGtjuhh1Zky30KgWX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gaiNiajUtb472SzApfaJr7wF0CU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3667,"name":"time"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
