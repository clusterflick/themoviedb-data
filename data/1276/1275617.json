With camera rolling, Elliott divides the unsuspecting participants by eye color – blue eye in one group, brown eyes (many of them Native Canadian) in the other. Elliott turns the tables on the participants, treating the blue eyes as “persons of color,” confronting and browbeating them, while the brown eyes are treated with respect. It illustrates and exposes how systemic racism develops.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Indecently Exposed!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1196543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Elliott","original_name":"Jane Elliott","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":"/n55qVpoRlKShBixueiJdV7Ce8ux.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"661fa851a6fdaa01636b1b42","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0795401","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
