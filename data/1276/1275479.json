Standing tall over the Revelstoke valley Mount Begbie has inspired an entire community. It is iconicized in the logos and names of local businesses, featured heavily in artists' works, is photographed by every visiting tourist, and most importantly of all, is explored by the outdoor enthusiast - no matter the season. Climbing Mt Begbie is a \"right of passage\" for every hiker, climber, sledder, and skier who chooses to make Revelstoke their home. While this peak has created an entire contemporary culture in Revelstoke, its name and story only represent colonial history, with no reference to the Indigenous heritage of this land. Is it the outdoor community's responsibility to help change this?","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/u1sMm1roDVgRGAEBO1TUYVVAS84.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Begbie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariel Hill","original_name":"Ariel Hill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"661f072bd18fb9017dcaf8e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Patterson","original_name":"Tim Patterson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"661f073b1cfe3a01319a9e5b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dale Tomma","original_name":"Dale Tomma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"661f07433c4344017c03616f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shelly Boyd","original_name":"Shelly Boyd","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"661f074b6a300b017e32b316","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nahanni Mckay","original_name":"Nahanni Mckay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"661f07523c4344017c036180","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657130,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zoya Lynch","original_name":"Zoya Lynch","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f0761ecaef50163f9091a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657131,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Natalie Segal","original_name":"Natalie Segal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f076f20af7701313d06f4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657130,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zoya Lynch","original_name":"Zoya Lynch","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f077cd18fb9017dcaf903","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657132,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hayley Morin","original_name":"Hayley Morin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f0787a6fdaa013169e691","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657131,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Natalie Segal","original_name":"Natalie Segal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f07966d9fe8017d609b91","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657133,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Colleen Gentemann","original_name":"Colleen Gentemann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f07a30816c70163ee1b75","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657134,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paul Ryan Collins","original_name":"Paul Ryan Collins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f07abd75bd60163314570","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657139,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jeff Yellen","original_name":"Jeff Yellen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f07eb96670e017dd97ef5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4306677,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Lou Currie","original_name":"Lou Currie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f0802528b2e014a3e8836","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p2B5XwZwtrqFwniLCYhCJPnX1jM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":764,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u1sMm1roDVgRGAEBO1TUYVVAS84.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":509}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":331407,"name":"mountain culture"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Beyond Begbie Trailer","key":"HjCg5m-O-XU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-06-09T20:57:16.000Z","id":"661f082320af77017d3e582a"}]}}}
