By zooming into and rewinding the footage, Afshar aborts the attacks and deflates the violent consequences of armed conflicts, while the layered soundscape—from an anxious heartbeat to a dying pulse—places humanity in an atmosphere of chaos. Undone imagines the possibility of “undoing” the acts of violence that continue to mark our present moment.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Undone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
