This ancient hunting technique, passed down from generation to generation, is the main livelihood of the village. However, times are slowly changing as the youth are leaving the village for work and studies, while there is pressure from the outside world to stop their whaling. The perspectives of four locals are followed; Kris, a 15 year old girl attending the local high school, her father, Karolous, a seasoned harpooner, Ignacious, a respected ship builder, and Sister Maria, a Catholic nun. They each give their opinions and insight into the mentioned conflicts, and welcome us into their world as we explore their daily lives.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3HMFnSE64QgvOWWLiu1zcjBrMOf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2019-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lamalera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4656071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karsten Tadie","original_name":"Karsten Tadie","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661e79333c4344017c03074d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4656071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karsten Tadie","original_name":"Karsten Tadie","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661e79413c4344017c030763","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4656072,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Matias Revez","original_name":"Matias Revez","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661e7966a6fdaa017d6add7f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4656072,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Matias Revez","original_name":"Matias Revez","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661e7955b84cdd0131638416","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2260826,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wiebe van der Vliet","original_name":"Wiebe van der Vliet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661e798e0816c7017cee69a0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4656071,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karsten Tadie","original_name":"Karsten Tadie","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661e7976d75bd6017c3195d7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32128342","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3HMFnSE64QgvOWWLiu1zcjBrMOf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARCTIC OPEN - Arctic Countries Film Festival","release_date":"2019-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Lamalera - a legacy of whaling | Trailer","key":"d-sOnWMBJgM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-14T15:51:03.000Z","id":"661e7907d18fb90131c9c391"}]}}}
