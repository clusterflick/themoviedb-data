They are performative visuals, depicting places that have yet to exist. Happy human archetypes are pasted in the ‘perfect’ house, which is placed in an idealised environment. At the core of this peculiar world-building practise, the narrative of hyper-perfection fashions a sleek paradise, propels capitalist norms and shapes our collective imagination of desirable lifestyles, cities and potential futures.  Where the facade bends plays with these 'neither real nor imaginary’ places. With collaged fragments of renders, the video reassembles a new space, a stage for a journey through the backsides, absurdities and ruptures of such smooth surfaces.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/95TCGeVMqmzhxw5zAGw8aSRS3mw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where the facade bends","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther van der Heijden","original_name":"Esther van der Heijden","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"661f9072c09e99017db0967c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657626,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ana Becerra Martínez","original_name":"Ana Becerra Martínez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f9063a6fdaa017d6c186a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657624,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Czich","original_name":"Sophie Czich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f9023b84cdd017d65268c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657625,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juanlu Montoro","original_name":"Juanlu Montoro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f9052d75bd6017c32b9e5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/95TCGeVMqmzhxw5zAGw8aSRS3mw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
