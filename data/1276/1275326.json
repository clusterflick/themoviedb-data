Its goal is to bring this beautiful but somewhat forgotten region of Slovakia closer to the public. The film is primarily focused on the phenomenon of the cultural-natural landscape, of which man has been a part for a long time. He gradually reshaped it in his own image until its present form. Thanks to the approach of our ancestors, species-rich communities of flowery meadows and pastures, fields and grazing forests were created here. However, in recent centuries, our society and with it the country has undergone many changes. With the absence of traditional farming, the colorful landscape mosaic and many rare organisms are disappearing. Therefore, the main message of this document is to point out the necessity of restoring forms of management that are close to nature, talking about mosaic mowing, extensive grazing and others.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/FjfVWRNodcfgrXSfOsUJFD1jeL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2014-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Biele Karpaty - Kráľovstvo strážené Vršatcom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4240285,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jakub Cíbik","original_name":"Jakub Cíbik","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"661eba72ecaef50149f88a5b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261690,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"MAOK","original_name":"MAOK","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661eb7e6c09e990131aeff5b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4240285,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jakub Cíbik","original_name":"Jakub Cíbik","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661eb7826d9fe80163601423","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4240285,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jakub Cíbik","original_name":"Jakub Cíbik","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661eb7a121621b017df0f162","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4240285,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jakub Cíbik","original_name":"Jakub Cíbik","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661eb78a20af77017d3e28d5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/FjfVWRNodcfgrXSfOsUJFD1jeL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sk","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
