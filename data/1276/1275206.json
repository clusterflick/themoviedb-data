This timely documentary interweaves the stories of six soldiers who, after years of loyal reserve duty and annual active combat, find they can no longer countenance serving in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. They become \"refusniks\" - an action that puts them at odds with deeply held national values and has devastating consequences in their own lives. In the film, six of the signers of the original \"Combatants’ Letter\" reveal the untenable combat experiences that led to their decision, the public outcry it provoked and the price they continue to pay for refusing to serve - including isolation, family ostracism and imprisonment.
