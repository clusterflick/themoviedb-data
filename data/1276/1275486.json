On one side rests a shuttered military fort, a local hotspot for summer tourists. But for those brave enough to walk beyond, will find a vibrant community on the island's south-facing side. This tight-knit, working-class community is a relic of a century-old Portuguese fishing village; its lucky few have worked hard to maintain and pass down their humble cottages since the 1800s. Now, the state has claimed the island for parkland, and the current generation is the last to own their beloved summer escape. This short film takes a sentimental look at the islanders' efforts to preserve its traditions, while ruminating its history and inevitable end.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/sGOUe0wDMjfm65eueX06LL8NfVH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If The Island Could Talk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1941210,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kate Fisher","original_name":"Kate Fisher","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f0b0ac09e99017daff0a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657160,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carolyn Crombie","original_name":"Carolyn Crombie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f0b153c4344017c036375","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657161,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Heather Crombie","original_name":"Heather Crombie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f0b1d7aecc6017c6c0e4a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1941210,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kate Fisher","original_name":"Kate Fisher","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f0b28ecaef50163f90a23","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657163,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andres Otero","original_name":"Andres Otero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661f0b33b84cdd014a63b4b9","department":"Writing","job":"Story Consultant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.782,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8VFUySBmWyJqLVc7R9OfxzimYCt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1283}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sGOUe0wDMjfm65eueX06LL8NfVH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
