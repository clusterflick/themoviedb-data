Parker: One Ship, Twice Sunk","overview":"Who would have thought a ship could sink twice? That’s exactly what happened to the wooden steamer A.A. Parker, but on September 19th, 1903, Lake Superior would finally claim the vessel. Miraculously no one lost their life. Join us at the premiere of this mini-documentary and learn how the crew of the Parker was saved in a brave rescue mission. Then, almost 100 years  later after it sank, it was discovered by the Great Lake Shipwreck Historical Society, which was surprised by the way it’s sitting on the bottom of the lake. We also pay an emotional tribute to a diver who loved exploring the bottom of our Great Lakes","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A.A.
