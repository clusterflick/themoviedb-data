After venturing to a rural house party – in the hope of meeting someone who will finally accept her as Deaf – Joy instead finds herself as an unwelcome guest. Worse still, the overload of noise in the party causes her cochlear implant to emit an excruciating noise in her head; a discomfort which only further frustrates her hearing sister Abbigail. Abandoned, can Joy find a way to escape the house, and the sounds in her head, before she is swallowed up in the growing storm of blood, booze and broken glass?","popularity":0.045,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"See For Yourself","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4656418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kylie Aoibheann McDonnell","original_name":"Kylie Aoibheann McDonnell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661eb2c4ecaef5017cf97e03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
