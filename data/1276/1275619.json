In this interview, Paul Delvaux talks about his origins and career. He talks about his painting, in which nothing is ever taken for granted, and the eroticism that emanates from his canvases. He talks about his fear of the blank canvas and his taste for antiquity, passed on to him by one of his Latin and Greek teachers. With great modesty, he recalls his appointments to the Picard Academy and the Grande Académie, his claim to fame. The camera also follows him to the opening of his exhibition at the Grand Palais in Paris, attended by Princess Paola. Paul-Henri Spaak, former Belgian Prime Minister and fellow student of Paul Delvaux's at the Athénée de St Gilles, recalls some of his memories and the impression Paul Delvaux left on him: \"He was already a little in his dream, not on the same plane as us\".","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rencontre avec Paul Delvaux","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2974302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Antoine","original_name":"Jean Antoine","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661fa95bd18fb9017dcbddac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
