The Adirondack Canoe Classic is a three-day race across the Adirondack Park in northern New York that’s been raced each September since 1983. When the 2020 event was canceled due to Covid-19, Cam and Mike decided it was time to take on the event’s less official offshoot — the Cannonball 90, sometimes called the Outlaw 90, where paddlers attempt the full 90-mile route in a day. This is the story of that day.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Padding Across the Adirondacks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4657982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Symancek","original_name":"Ryan Symancek","popularity":0.0438,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661fc5b53c43440149028f5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
