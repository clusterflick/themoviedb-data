To retaliate against their invalidating classmates and teacher, they audition for the worldâ€™s top BFA Musical Theatre programs to prove to everyone they have what it takes. BOOKED is a modern coming-of-age comedy that explores the complex dynamics of childhood friendships, suburban familial tribulations, the triviality of high school theatre, and the farcical yet completely real and highly competitive process that is auditioning for drama school.","popularity":0.0322,"poster_path":"/s0rnGmujJB9hUsKLqQkhq6ppPp2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":226312,"logo_path":null,"name":"35th Parallel Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Break a leg.
