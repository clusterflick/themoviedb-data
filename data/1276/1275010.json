It is full of masterpieces, an endless resource of history, an endless source of stories. But whose stories are told? Which art has the most impact and on whom? The power of great art lies in its ability to communicate with anyone, no matter their art historical knowledge, their background, their beliefs.  This film gives voice to those who work at the gallery – from cleaner to curator, security guard to director – who identify the one artwork that means the most to them and why. An assortment of people from all walks of life who have a strong connection to the gallery make surprising choices of both well-known and lesser-known artworks. Finally, some well-known celebrities explain what they head for when they visit the gallery.  These stories are used as a lens through which to explore the 200-year history of the National Gallery and what the future may hold for this spectacular space.","popularity":1.3868,"poster_path":"/aJuOsOOZq4rXprDha2qSgdwmI9S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seventh Art Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My National Gallery, London","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Grabsky","original_name":"Phil Grabsky","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661da9926d9fe8017d5f9e50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2479475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Ray","original_name":"Ali Ray","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661da99f6d9fe8017d5f9e55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4655077,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Clive Matlock","original_name":"Clive Matlock","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661daa851cfe3a01649a8583","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32126187","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ojPYyDLPEOAs52O6eB6VBAZo1rR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/56lyEWQ2wo2ku8paozc4EAoQNYo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1728,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aJuOsOOZq4rXprDha2qSgdwmI9S.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1152},{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1184,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dTFLEQvS5abNijC0AjLA482xf6D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/cOMyz9wUz9q7pKflzmYUYl2Y3IB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2384,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/5niZIwrpVP7XfRMHedOatbMw8sp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1589}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15478,"name":"art gallery"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"T","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
