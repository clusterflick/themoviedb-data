The film rises out of the darkness, enveloping viewers in a breathtaking spectacle of sight and sound. Dramatic aerial footage whisks you across sweeping vistas. The original musical score, which encompasses the spectrum of sound from a lone Indian flute to full orchestral scoring, enhances the imagery. Old West scenery and Native American settings are painstakingly replicated. The part of our heroine, after which the town took its name, is believably portrayed by the founder's actual great grand-daughter. Viewers will travel back eons in time as the earth transformed into this fascinating region.â€”SuperVue Theater","popularity":0.3432,"poster_path":"/xHizxmY5oqiduJKvT8Kb3Vx7W34.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A breathtaking journey through the red rocks of Sedona, Arizona.","title":"Sedona: The Spirit of Wonder","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1232714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Morrow","original_name":"Don Morrow","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"661eb87fa39d0b0163551f3f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4656448,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Grumman","original_name":"Francis Grumman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661eb89896670e017dd95e88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4656449,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Motta","original_name":"Mark Motta","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661eb8b00816c7017cee979d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0372514","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xHizxmY5oqiduJKvT8Kb3Vx7W34.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1122}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":327819,"name":"imax"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
