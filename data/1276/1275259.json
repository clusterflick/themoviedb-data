Filmmaker Ueno deftly pairs text-on-screen excerpts from his dream diary with a visual track of travel photos (taken by a friend) stacked neatly by hand (hands we see), one-by-one on a table shot by an overhead camera, creating a quietly comic and priceless dream travelogue. Satisfyingly drenched with the absurdities of dream stuff and coupled with the smartly curated vacation photos, A fiction right after you wake up will be as inspiring to writers as to filmmakers, and an all-around pleasure to us dream-keepers, travelers, and ordinary filmgoers.","popularity":0.0475,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A fiction right after you wake up","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2145140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takahiro Ueno","original_name":"Takahiro Ueno","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"661e8cf4b84cdd014a63a653","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Good Symptom","release_date":"2024-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
