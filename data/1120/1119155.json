The video, created using the fighting game Soulcalibur, features two players both controlling the character Voldo, using existing in-game animation to have the characters perform a synchronized dance to the song \"Hot in Herre\" by musician Nelly. The result of over a week's full-time preparation and training, the video was conceived after Brandt noticed the character's animations and attacks could be triggered in sync with the beat of a song, and the reactions of onlookers to such a display. While several groups demonstrated interest in showcasing the video, complications arose from the copyright holders whose works were involved in creation.","popularity":0.0966,"poster_path":"/9ygk2gHjqzauTQ6X26Exrjuff3n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dance, Voldo, Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1063830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Brandt","original_name":"Chris Brandt","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b959c336e01056b735034","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9ygk2gHjqzauTQ6X26Exrjuff3n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
