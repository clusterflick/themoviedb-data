Disillusioned with his vocation, Aital dispenses more common sense advice than mystical succour to his clients, whose complaints range from impotence to demonic possession – but he is still haunted by the suspicion that there is something otherworldly at play. Vladimir Munkuev’s witty, humane take on the role of the supernatural in a disenchanted world demonstrates Sakha cinema’s deep concern for native traditions.","popularity":0.1588,"poster_path":"/ndCZcIQZDVqvGZuW0ZJIP57ofdl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aital","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2013500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir Munkuev","original_name":"Vladimir Munkuev","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/bDaMsS9KMKzEvrLjoz8XPO47Q5C.jpg","credit_id":"644c8850336e01283a73c604","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ndCZcIQZDVqvGZuW0ZJIP57ofdl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":905}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":232397,"name":"sakha"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
