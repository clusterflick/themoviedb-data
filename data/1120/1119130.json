Who are these flaghoisters? And what does it mean to identify with your region? These are questions that filmmaker Okki Poortvliet, theatermaker Hans van der Werf and designer Vera Vos asked. So, they went through the whole of Drenthe, a region in the North of The Netherlands where all three of them grew up, to collect as many stories as possible from hoisters of the flag of Drenthe.  The Flaghoisters is a film about the confrontation between the countryside and, as people from Drenthe call it, “the city dwellers”. A story about a disappearing language, the safety of your village, greeting each other, being proud, and just acting \"normal\".","popularity":0.2313,"poster_path":"/lFrCST5Y1Dl5wgqtLxkPeyaCLLZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flaghoisters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3109960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Okki Poortvliet","original_name":"Okki Poortvliet","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b847b0c125505757ae2d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans van der Werf","original_name":"Hans van der Werf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b848b726fb105c80607d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033335,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vera Vos","original_name":"Vera Vos","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b849651a64e088add3389","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033335,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vera Vos","original_name":"Vera Vos","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b84a6fba6250558d5b7d8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans van der Werf","original_name":"Hans van der Werf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b84b50c125505d47ae2b5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033335,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vera Vos","original_name":"Vera Vos","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b84c351a64e086fdd2f53","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3410479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabian van der Dussen","original_name":"Fabian van der Dussen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b84d0726fb105c80607ec","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3410479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabian van der Dussen","original_name":"Fabian van der Dussen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b84defba62504dad5b826","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033337,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sam Alma","original_name":"Sam Alma","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b84e8fba62502fbd5b6ca","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3109960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Okki Poortvliet","original_name":"Okki Poortvliet","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b84fc51a64e086fdd2f7d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3109960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Okki Poortvliet","original_name":"Okki Poortvliet","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b851a596a91052157c12b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1558977,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wart Wamsteker","original_name":"Wart Wamsteker","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b7ad63a806730125d13422","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8r9KDlNBZPugXK7XpcPY4Q1GVwu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/eLtNZbx9iajMPMklNWGEAV9si34.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lFrCST5Y1Dl5wgqtLxkPeyaCLLZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":548,"name":"countryside"},{"id":156501,"name":"pride"},{"id":157332,"name":"flag"},{"id":226452,"name":"regional"},{"id":233482,"name":"drenthe"},{"id":283307,"name":"linguistic minority"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer The Flaghoisters","key":"833102077","site":"Vimeo","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-06-04T18:54:16.000Z","id":"647cdf1226346200f92960be"}]}}}
