It is an abstract experimental short film. Tempo degenerative, as the title implies, is an experience that gradually gains in chaos while overlapping an overwhelming base structure from the start. I invite the audience to contemplate the fact that we are the sum total of our memories, from a place where the mind is not eternal nor spotless. Confusion, juxtaposition, disorientation, and loss of self. There are minimalist drawings being spun on a motorized zoetrope combined with a strobe as a way to refer to the confusion and disorientation those who suffer from neurodegenerative disease experience, which are gradually changed to more complex compositions relating to more personal memories. You’re on what feels like your last string, hoping things will eventually calm down. It's a nonstop flight or fight.","popularity":0.3372,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tempodégénérative","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4035936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Léa Saint-Laurent Workowich","original_name":"Léa Saint-Laurent Workowich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644dc2dd9affc0049ddfb1b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
