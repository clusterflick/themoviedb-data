We meet Aurora, a 30 something graphic designer unhappy with where her life is - including the relationship with her boyfriend. We follow her to a picnic with her new crush: Sol, a 20 something programmer, and interactive artist, plus Sol's friends, a group of tech/art misfits. As the night unfolds Aurora finds and loses herself within Sol, becoming inebriated with the prospect of the kind of life she's dreamed of for herself, but hasn't achieved.","popularity":0.062,"poster_path":"/k8m7Sbbu1MZ7ELrfliexs8uW3sN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aurora","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2276223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolle Marquez","original_name":"Nicolle Marquez","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"644bd5440c125505a17b0286","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219122,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samantha Mishinski","original_name":"Samantha Mishinski","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"644bd54c0c125505147b00ae","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3356177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laith Khalifeh","original_name":"Laith Khalifeh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"644bd559596a9104f557e716","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teyonna Johnson","original_name":"Teyonna Johnson","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"644bd56051a64e086fdd4dea","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josephine Yu-Ting","original_name":"Josephine Yu-Ting","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"644bd56bfba6250582d5d8b6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saso","original_name":"Saso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"644bd572fba625052ed5dc09","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Rancier","original_name":"Alina Rancier","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b9abcfba625052ed5c0d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16309616","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k8m7Sbbu1MZ7ELrfliexs8uW3sN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
