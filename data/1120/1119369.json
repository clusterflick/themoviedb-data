L’últim equip del Juancar","overview":"The story of Juan Carlos Unzué's daily life during two and a half years, since the former goalkeeper and trainer of Barça went public with his ALS diagnosis in June 2020. Right from day one he decided, on the one hand, to lend visibility to the disease in order to denounce the lack of help for those who suffer from it and, on the other, to organise a big event to raise as much money as possible for research. The documentary exhaustively follows all of the meetings and conversations held with managers of FC Barcelona and Manchester City to arrange a football game that succeeded in raising 4.5 million euros. Meanwhile, Unzué opens the doors to his home and reveals the evolution of his physical degeneration.","popularity":0.3877,"poster_path":"/nHFzG8yW8fj7ANqOfaH2SZwP7bv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33916,"logo_path":"/xeBwba4AfwmDaBGG0ok1MzLJZrn.png","name":"A Contracorriente Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":5085,"logo_path":"/mPuVc7m1Ki7OQQvAYwYfIlEI3vu.png","name":"TV3","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2023-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unzué.
