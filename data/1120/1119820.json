After two weeks, he was reborn as Ka-Tzetnik, “the man from the camps.” The books that he wrote were translated into 32 languages and sold millions, while the author himself hid behind the pseudonym Ka-Tzetnik. At the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961 his revelatory testimony revealed his true identity as he described Auschwitz as “the other planet,” a place outside of human judgment. Years later, undergoing an experimental LSD treatment for trauma, he revisits his experience, imagining himself as a SS officer, and that changes everything.","popularity":0.226,"poster_path":"/qaOhBUAJVpFl8zSCXX1qySsydcI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68453,"logo_path":"/nZRjWqPwyr58Nxz1F6XLFZ2V2CJ.png","name":"Black Sheep Film Productions","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2025-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return from the Other Planet","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2163702,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Assaf Lapid","original_name":"Assaf Lapid","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644dc4226eecee04e800f4aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2163702,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Assaf Lapid","original_name":"Assaf Lapid","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d4a9095963ebffde7b88da","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1817393,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Naomi Levari","original_name":"Naomi Levari","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d4a93613d0e96b427b8883","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1817392,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Saar Yogev","original_name":"Saar Yogev","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67d4a94f13d0e96b427b8891","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14888952","wikidata_id":"Q125947452","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dci3b1dC8PX3P5ZXnO7v6mjRcpC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1511},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2hfTtNs11T6xfI6aq0qYpFHyK4B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1511}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.722,"height":1390,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qaOhBUAJVpFl8zSCXX1qySsydcI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1004},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":992,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/AkyqseKk8oXTAuK6qK5hzlXnKze.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":661}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Warsaw Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2024-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
