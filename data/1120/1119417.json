In little more than a lifetime, fueled by their faith, wealth and mission, we follow the lives of six powerful Popes and their family dynasties - and how they take on the task of first rebuilding, then glorifying, the new Rome. The Lost Road of the Popes unfolds the miracle of this remarkable renaissance. How Rome and its Papal rulers not only survived, but were inspired by a Holy road to create the magnificent monuments, churches, art and architecture that helped to glorify and save the Catholic Church. And why that once powerful road has been...forgotten.","popularity":0.2812,"poster_path":"/xzrJVSqEYVNL7aYgt3GBvVkIsW3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Road of the Popes: Via Papale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Dennehy","original_name":"Brian Dennehy","popularity":1.4074,"profile_path":"/cg7CwS1vMJXCzZ0FUm4RbrjAJ2t.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"644c57cc51a64e08b0dd8370","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":67661,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gordy Haab","original_name":"Gordy Haab","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/aZleRZb0r64JZpfjlbM1M74wPB.jpg","credit_id":"644c583be2ff320953d25dfb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1470694","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":1019,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xzrJVSqEYVNL7aYgt3GBvVkIsW3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":691}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
