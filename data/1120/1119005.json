Amid gang wars, street riots and growing tensions between citizens and police - the community needed a safe space, a political hub, a cultural center and a home-away-from-home. Coogan's Way is the story of how a small bar and restaurant that welcomed all races, religions and interests became a force for good in their community. And how decades later, when the owners were faced with the challenges of a rapidly-changing NYC real estate market, their diverse and dynamic clientele fought for this beloved institution.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/gtZvX1qtuVJioFMrCVsGo0dC6E4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coogan's Way","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4032830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Glenn Østen Anderson","original_name":"Glenn Østen Anderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b046ffea0d70593143473","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14957642","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gtZvX1qtuVJioFMrCVsGo0dC6E4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
