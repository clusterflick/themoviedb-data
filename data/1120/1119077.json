Sudan’s death was tragic, but not a surprise. Zacharia, the head rhino caregiver at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in northern Kenya, was caring for one of the last remaining northern white rhinos on the planet. But this is not just the story of Zacharia’s loss or of the death of a rhino. This is the story of the death of a species. A loss of such magnitude is a loss for all of humanity. Without these creatures, we suffer more than just the loss of ecosystem health. We suffer a loss of imagination, a loss of wonder, a loss of beautiful possibilities.","popularity":0.3418,"poster_path":"/6b4W3qHLX8yzaVMznQT0Eoo86i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remembering Sudan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4033165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zacharia Mutai","original_name":"Zacharia Mutai","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/oK4fHbj8PsLtCmEQ4ZhpOVyzIn2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"644b5411336e0104ed733638","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290528,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ami Vitale","original_name":"Ami Vitale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b53df0c125505a17ad08b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mediastorm","original_name":"Mediastorm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b53fb51a64e0922dd1e15","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6b4W3qHLX8yzaVMznQT0Eoo86i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9902,"name":"wildlife"},{"id":211505,"name":"wildlife conservation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
