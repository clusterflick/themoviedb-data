Matthew Cassel, an independent multimedia journalist and filmmaker based in Istanbul, follows the seven-month, obstacle-laden 1700-mile journey of Aboud Shalhoub, a Syrian refugee who has fled the dangers of wartime Damascus in order to build a better life for his family in the Netherlands. Cassel's colleague Simon Safieh remained in Damascus with Aboud's wife and two children, who eventually join him in Europe.","popularity":1.2278,"poster_path":"/iIrWA8Qx75ZBI1fFIuIPkxpTBvg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Field of Vision
