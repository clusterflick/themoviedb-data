Schulz comic strip Peanuts. It originally aired on the CBS network on February 2, 1990. Hosted by Knots Landing star Michele Lee, this special includes a reunion of actors and actresses who voiced Peanuts characters from 1965 to 1989. Also included are a B.B. King performance of Joe Cool and clips from the seldom-seen 1973 Hallmark Hall of Fame live-action production of You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown. Unlike the other Peanuts anniversary specials before and after, this was the only one that was released to home video by Paramount Home Video.","popularity":0.5812,"poster_path":"/waXhbNXZ5BUb9mS8b2IC9srgsUn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16340,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lee Mendelson Film Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":16341,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bill Melendez Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":16339,"logo_path":null,"name":"Charles M.
