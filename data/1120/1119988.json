He is glad that he finally has the opportunity to do his favorite thing, while benefiting people. However, since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Gleb has been losing faith in the future . Constantly listening to the news, losing close friends who have left the country, watching the horrific actions of the Russian authorities and the general mood around him, he increasingly doubts the adequacy of this world. As a result, Gleb comes to the conclusion that the mental hospital is now, oddly enough, the only normal place and decides to stay there.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":"/wYxiYlo2ikBlUztogvRSrO6aSd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2023-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Patient","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4036712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gleb Ganichev","original_name":"Gleb Ganichev","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"644e79149affc01fd8df9b1c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3999633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Motya Shevarikhina","original_name":"Motya Shevarikhina","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/hKIFg3Z7UJjzTiv5R8huehCvBwp.jpg","credit_id":"65f624d5d8f44e01634f064d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2252854,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Denis Nazarov","original_name":"Denis Nazarov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644e796d9affc01ffedf997e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1433551,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikhail Zheleznikov","original_name":"Mikhail Zheleznikov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/a28Be3Q6Euw8FpWqjDjVc0sBla3.jpg","credit_id":"644e79c235c30a0370614665","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":795,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wYxiYlo2ikBlUztogvRSrO6aSd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
