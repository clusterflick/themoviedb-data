In these dreams, she searches for her home and waits for her beloved husband. The dreams are permeated with fear and the foreboding of a war that could leave her without a husband and home. The film was conceived as a psychoanalytical visual essay on how a subject who has experienced loss tries to assemble themselves from splinters: fragments of memories, dreams, bodily sensations - to find this new self-image 'on the other side of the mirror' after the Other has disappeared.","popularity":0.3305,"poster_path":"/oHrODzsQK4BFeQBi6tXtyasf2pq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2023-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Splinters","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Z ulamkiv","type":"translit"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"From Splinters","type":"English title"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"From Splinters","type":"English Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4035746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olena Hruzdieva","original_name":"Olena Hruzdieva","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The heroine","credit_id":"644d9cabf90b1905f4131c96","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4035746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olena Hruzdieva","original_name":"Olena Hruzdieva","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644d9d3ad4d509054ef92650","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4035746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olena Hruzdieva","original_name":"Olena Hruzdieva","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644d9d316beaea0a412b5a1d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4035753,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Antonina Simonova","original_name":"Antonina Simonova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644d9d5b4d23dd070992c27e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4037290,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Korunov","original_name":"George Korunov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644ed18eb87aec02f4c26898","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4037291,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Valeriia Buradzhyieva","original_name":"Valeriia Buradzhyieva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644ed1a5b87aec0303c2653e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27637324","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dsqvM5jwOmqV9enS9bCgL6DdZjE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ploIi5SKjtPNdtp0qcUwnJUfqQ0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/552rzCubrXA9B6NjSlz6o7TyIhG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qPQ5DwmlffYeP3RtjrQ40wU0vRZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oHrODzsQK4BFeQBi6tXtyasf2pq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4379,"name":"time travel"},{"id":6203,"name":"loss"},{"id":229785,"name":"dreamscape"},{"id":272265,"name":"ukraine"},{"id":273967,"name":"war"},{"id":317008,"name":"forebonding"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ukrainian Dream Film Festival, Odesa","release_date":"2023-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
