The railroad brought commerce, innovation, diverse populations, disease, corruption, imperialism. The rail lines through the southwest often had a negative impact on indigenous culture and contributed to the decimation of the buffalo. When the diesel engine was introduced, the railyard was no longer needed, and like many outmoded technologies, was left to the ghosts of the past. Ghosts is a tour of abandonment and unseen loss filmed in the Albuquerque Railyard.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghosts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3543798,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deborah Fort","original_name":"Deborah Fort","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f2a1e4eddec28b03ad6cf7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
