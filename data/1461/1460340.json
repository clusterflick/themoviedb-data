Panzarino processes footage of a drive through Rocky Mountain National Park using Signal Culture's Wobbulator, Jones MVIP Eurorack module (an analog video synthesizer), and Maelstrom software app. The footage is then chromakeyed onto Panzarino's green screen-colored nails as she works with the tools in Signal Culture's studio. This video captures the transformative quality of Colorado's natural beauty and stunning landscapes while guiding viewers through a portal from analog to digital image processing.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colorful Colorado Nails","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4298914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monica Panzarino","original_name":"Monica Panzarino","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f29fa11bb047289999299f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EiC","release_date":"2025-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
