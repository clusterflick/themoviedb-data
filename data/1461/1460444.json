He repeatedly says out loud, 'An egg, the white is gone but the yellow remains.' The video clearly shows the impossible reconciliation between the colonizer and the colonized. Inside an egg, the white and the yellow coexist harmoniously and naturally, even though they don't have the same texture, color, shape, or smell. But when there is a fracture, a break, or a rupture between them, each follows its own nature. The egg is a prison; it is the symbol of both creativity and fertility, hope and a promise of life, a new birth, and regeneration. With the broken egg, horror takes over. It's the paradox of the egg: on one side, there are broken shells, a shattered life, and on the other, the hope of a return to life and rebirth.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An egg, the white is gone but the yellow remains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5353262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed Thara","original_name":"Mohamed Thara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f2c8a8a1576bf269d91072","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EiC","release_date":"2025-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
