We observe this history being deconstructed and reconstructed through human bodies, which, coexisting with the poetry of the queer woman poet Sappho, in the place where she is believed to have grown up and written, Eresos Lesvos, try to reconstruct a collective memory based on the freedom of their bodies and their environment. As the sunlight spreads across space until it sets, there is a passage from one spatio-temporal point in history to another, from the sound of cicadas to the sound of machines and then to hope.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/p8n2ts6Zm8exUkmGKj4HUqkUkou.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2025-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"A revision of history through Sappho's poetry, in the place where she was inspired.","title":"her thread or black land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5355259,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tzenia Dimitriadou","original_name":"Dimitriadou Polyxeni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3deb56c3583c975992e1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5355259,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tzenia Dimitriadou","original_name":"Dimitriadou Polyxeni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3debfe1d5c23c6ed98d8d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3750367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elli Lyberopoulou","original_name":"Elli Lyberopoulou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3dede854b0538cfd93e97","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3750367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elli Lyberopoulou","original_name":"Elli Lyberopoulou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3df080f20f9c45cad9103","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5355265,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elli Lyberopoulou","original_name":"Elli Lyberopoulou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3df1e854b0538cfd93ede","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5355259,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tzenia Dimitriadou","original_name":"Dimitriadou Polyxeni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3df34854b0538cfd93ef7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5355259,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tzenia Dimitriadou","original_name":"Dimitriadou Polyxeni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3df3e854b0538cfd93f0c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5355259,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tzenia Dimitriadou","original_name":"Dimitriadou Polyxeni","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3df501bb0472899996538","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p8n2ts6Zm8exUkmGKj4HUqkUkou.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
