There, the commissioner of New Morals, Marcos Renieris, delivers to him for reforming the widow Niobe, whose crime lies in the fact that she mourns excessively for her dead husband and that she reads Sophocles' Antigone. Niobe asks Kappa to love her; Kappa hesitates; Niobe runs away from him and he remains trapped in the stairwell.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/ySHcTG2zWmeUX5Z6sL3UylcnQbn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178474,"logo_path":"/AvEu3FUJOiul65MTD74MQmQckQi.png","name":"Film School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2025-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"the truth, the meta-truth and the lie","title":"THE GOLDFISH AND THE TRUTH","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5355493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Ververis","original_name":"George Ververis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67f3f1a1e1d5c23c6ed997be","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5355495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zaharouha Holeva","original_name":"Zaharouha Holeva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67f3f1c5a1576bf269d94ebe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5355497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Halvatzoglou","original_name":"Olga Halvatzoglou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67f3f1db6c3583c975993a38","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5355499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandros Drosinakis","original_name":"Alexandros Drosinakis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67f3f1e9eddec28b03adaa94","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5355502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Panagiotis Venetis","original_name":"Panagiotis Venetis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67f3f1fa2f7d4370279a2c10","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5355504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fotis Theodoridis","original_name":"Fotis Theodoridis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67f3f2096c3583c975993a71","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5355505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vasiliki Kanelliadou","original_name":"Vasiliki Kanelliadou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67f3f2176c3583c975993a7c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4667436,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stella Karagianni","original_name":"Stella Karagianni","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67f3f225eddec28b03adaaa6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5355506,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Petros Theodoridis","original_name":"Petros Theodoridis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"67f43af6eddec28b03adb5bf","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5355506,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Petros Theodoridis","original_name":"Petros Theodoridis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3f244a1576bf269d94f0c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5355506,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Petros Theodoridis","original_name":"Petros Theodoridis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3f24ee1d5c23c6ed99833","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3585823,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elisavet Manavi","original_name":"Elisavet Manavi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3f26a31c9f27299ad2409","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3585823,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elisavet Manavi","original_name":"Elisavet Manavi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3f278eddec28b03adaace","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1776483,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Panos Theodoridis","original_name":"Panos Theodoridis","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3f29aeddec28b03adaada","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ySHcTG2zWmeUX5Z6sL3UylcnQbn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
