Home to the Central Asian nomads and Sufism - a mystical movement of Islam - it also claims the world's origin of tulips and apples. In her film, The Nomad's Song, shot in Kazakhstan over the span of two years, filmmaker Sandra Powers follows the development of the ambitious international musical project, Silent Steppe Cantata. Independently documenting this bold artistic creation, its numerous challenges and the final premiere in the capital of Kazakhstan, while also unearthing a wealth of remarkable Soviet footage from the 1920s, she crafts a highly unique and poetic perspective of Kazakhstan and the visionaries behind the epic Cantata - composer Anne LeBaron and tenor Timur Bekbosunov.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nomad's Song","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2770418","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
