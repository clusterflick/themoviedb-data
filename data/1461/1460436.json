The locals started calling him \"the fool of Posillipo,\" as no one ever heard a gunshot. Nor did any birds die. Or, perhaps, Marey was involved in an imperceptible process of killing, shooting birds twelve times a second with his latest invention, the chronophotographic gun - a precursor to moving image technology. The audio-visual assemblage locates the \"gun camera\" as a speculative prototype of imperialist technology, shadowing related practices from the colonial sport of bird hunting to cartography, anthropometry, ethnographic field recordings, and modern warfare.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fool of Posillipo and Other Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2554992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santasil Mallik","original_name":"Santasil Mallik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f2c7150f20f9c45cad6073","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EiC","release_date":"2025-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
