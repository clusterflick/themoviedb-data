Their number has been declining for years. A young farmer is renaturalizing an abandoned area high above Lake Chiemsee. In hundreds of old orchards in the Alpine region, forgotten and rare varieties of fruit were sought out and new varieties were planted. The so-called Bavarian Sea stretches over a length of 14 kilometers. A section on the southern shore of Lake Chiemsee is closed. In this protected core zone lies the delta of the Tiroler Ache, an ideal resting place for migratory birds.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/v96FtrGiEzj9otjuUnGVGTe7HX2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AQ","name":"Antarctica"},{"iso_3166_1":"AG","name":"Antigua and Barbuda"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"AW","name":"Aruba"}],"release_date":"2024-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Durch das bayerische Alpenland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les Alpes bavaroises : Entre lacs et collines","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2533539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joachim Haupt","original_name":"Joachim Haupt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f30014f5a80aa54599fc8e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19712200","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3LALIQEcJCa0SbwgjEOPnmse8iV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/lcKibKEv1AIkkc8W4Ly1oNk52G4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":794,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/v96FtrGiEzj9otjuUnGVGTe7HX2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2024-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
