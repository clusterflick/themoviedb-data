He was one of the leading representatives of Orientalist painting at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. Obtaining a scholarship in 1884, Dinet undertook his first trip to southern Algeria in the region of Bou-Saâda, the Naili culture having a profound impact on him, as he would return there many times until he settled in his first Algerian studio in Biskra in 1900. In 1905, he bought a house in Bou-Saâda to spend three-quarters of the year there. In 1907, on his advice, the Villa Abd-el-Tif was created in Algiers, modeled on the Villa Medici in Rome. Having lived much of his life in Algeria, he called himself Nasreddine Dinet (نصر الدين ديني) after converting to Islam. On January 12, 1930, he was buried in the Bou-Saâda cemetery, where a museum that houses many of his works bears his name.","popularity":0.2226,"poster_path":"/aTYwDQJeoP6v2LtvLcjfHkxFKDM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139395,"logo_path":"/4NXn9zAMa8SH9zZnYPmt6okp6VM.png","name":"Office National pour le Commerce et l'Industrie Cinématographique (ONCIC)","origin_country":"DZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"نصر الدين ديني","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4369877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Étienne Dinet","original_name":"Étienne Dinet","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/3HyBjuyLpeOINJukRf69eL5qMvO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"67f31484ddf9194387d952fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5353691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lionel Tanguy","original_name":"Lionel Tanguy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Nasreddine Dinet","credit_id":"67f314717b43bdce20ad14e1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1440171,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rabah Laradji","original_name":"Rabah Laradji","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cJf0d4TxQKMW5jVzDjvQk7hENmT.jpg","credit_id":"67f314062f7d43702799f6de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1449879,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rachid Benallal","original_name":"Rachid Benallal","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jmCvMdaVjEIdwlCNzfq3NsTeUQM.jpg","credit_id":"67f314127b43bdce20ad14bc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1936954,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ahmed Malek","original_name":"Ahmed Malek","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/88SwW89spdNvxyJve0jlYPP0gME.jpg","credit_id":"67f31420ddf9194387d952c4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5353695,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Abdelhalim Nacer","original_name":"Abdelhalim Nacer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3151de1d5c23c6ed96a77","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3280550,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rabia Ben Mokhtar","original_name":"Rabia Ben Mokhtar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f315557b43bdce20ad1512","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2610667,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mohamed Saïd Bougermouh","original_name":"Mohamed Saïd Bougermouh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3160f0f20f9c45cad6d7c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5353701,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Miloud Bouamari","original_name":"Miloud Bouamari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3169e854b0538cfd9215b","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3317417,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mourad Messifi","original_name":"Mourad Messifi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f31f54f5a80aa5459a007d","department":"Art","job":"Assistant Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36458318","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/btCI4wzah46HqQFoSHbw47H6uca.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eB7hrRcSEanLFwLOA9hAMyoclOs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aTYwDQJeoP6v2LtvLcjfHkxFKDM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":198555,"name":"orientalism"},{"id":283800,"name":"docufiction"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"},{"id":329325,"name":"algerian painter"},{"id":349853,"name":"nasreddine dinet"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
