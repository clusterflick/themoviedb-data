A reflective journey of the forest and of the mind, carving a path between the physical world and the internal world. Words and phrases of a personal poem written by the filmmaker act as guide throughout the journey. This piece was filmed on super 8mm through various forests of California and New Mexico. Experimentations with digitally layering, sculpting, splicing, and distorting of film and sound create a kaleidoscopic and meditative effect.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Forest for the Trees","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5353081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alison Johnson","original_name":"Alison Johnson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f2a7e4ede8d82f3badad43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EiC","release_date":"2025-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
