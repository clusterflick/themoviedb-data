Jyoti, 41 and Mandeep, 39, grew up in the state of Punjab, northern India, in middle-class households. They received a good education and had promising careers in India. Then, in their early 20s, they each agreed to marry men living in Japan by arrangement. The women were excited to move to a foreign country and to be with their husbands but they had no prior knowledge of Japan. Having witnessed at a distance the lives of their relatives settled in the US, UK and Canada, they had similar expectations for their own future lives in Japan. But the reality was to prove different from the expectation.","popularity":0.1198,"poster_path":"/fYkB6mHqYdYsXmBAykPmgIub2QZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding their Niche: Unheard Stories of Migrant Women","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5354584,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Megha Wadhwa","original_name":"Megha Wadhwa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3a39f0f20f9c45cad8755","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5354584,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Megha Wadhwa","original_name":"Megha Wadhwa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3a3a91bb04728999956f5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5354584,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Megha Wadhwa","original_name":"Megha Wadhwa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3a3b4854b0538cfd93388","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2476038,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"François Yazbeck","original_name":"François Yazbeck","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3a3fa2f7d4370279a12a0","department":"Sound","job":"Recording Supervision"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2837245,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andy Lawrence","original_name":"Andy Lawrence","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f3a40da1576bf269d93b3f","department":"Editing","job":"Editorial Consultant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":786,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fYkB6mHqYdYsXmBAykPmgIub2QZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":526}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
