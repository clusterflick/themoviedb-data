Inspired by a county north of the Golden Gate Bridge labeled \"paradise on earth\", it draws attention to the mosaic of invisible struggles that plagues its people and has left them paralyzed in their efforts to find a rainbow in the fog. Its \"drawn-onfilm\" technique allows the viewer to be immersed in the cinematic aspects of the poem, which, created by the erasure of a previous text, highlight the beauty of few words floating on a painted sea. strikethrough 48 is one of the most recent erasure poems from my choreographic poetry archive strikethrough-score.org (ca. 2020), whose purpose is not only to encourage\r the writing of poetry using a digital algorithm, but the cross-pollination of\r poetry with other art forms.","popularity":0.0535,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"strikethrough 48","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4630780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maxine Flasher-Düzgüneş","original_name":"Maxine Flasher-Düzgüneş","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f2aa48a1576bf269d90a24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5353104,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jade Lien","original_name":"Jade Lien","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f2aa581bb0472899992c1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5353105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irene Lin","original_name":"Irene Lin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f2aa6da1576bf269d90a38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EiC","release_date":"2025-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
