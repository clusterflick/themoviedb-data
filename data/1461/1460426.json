Many of his statements about the arts, technology and life resonated very deeply with me. Now, after I have completed this piece, I feel that we are related. He could be my uncle in our family of artists who work across mediums in an interdisciplinary way. I feel both challenged and inspired by his work and wish he was still present. What stories he could tell! And what would he accomplish with the advances in technology that have been made in the last 30 years? Let us work to continue his legacy.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Become Living Things","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2743310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kit Young","original_name":"Kit Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f2c4bdddf9194387d942da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EiC","release_date":"2025-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
