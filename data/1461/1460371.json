Blurring the line between an experimental short and a cinematic poem, it seeks to build a succession of states under a concrete and volatile gaze that exceeds the eye as a natural technology of reading and observation – whether scientific, contemplative, or a daily act. Therefore, the nomadic and random observation proposed by Weathered by the Sun is lost in light, forgetfulness, love, and the stars. The film suggests a temper from the place that the sun and the sky occupy in our lives: a passion dissipated by walking, collecting, and picking up the remains of the world’s details.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weathered by the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5353093,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristobal Bianchi","original_name":"Cristobal Bianchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f2a94b854b0538cfd90cdb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EiC","release_date":"2025-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
