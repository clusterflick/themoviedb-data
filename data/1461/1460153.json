The trip ends in a dramatic dive into the water, and while the two inexperienced navigators are picked up unconscious by some fishermen, a good devil takes the little boy with him, whom he finds abandoned and crying on the shore. However, the disappearance is believed to be the result of a kidnapping and the poor devil, identified, risks going through a bad time if the nanny and her suitor, who have recovered, do not rush to justify him in time. The nanny finds in her marriage to her helmsman the compensation for the dismissal by the child's parents, and the good devil secures an honest job.","popularity":0.1346,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":146180,"logo_path":null,"name":"Società Anonima Films Attualità (SAFA)","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1936-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un bacio a fior d'acqua","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tino Bianchi","original_name":"Tino Bianchi","popularity":0.2545,"profile_path":"/fXlqjFSoJ3xiVJuJ9G29WJRIHUD.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Giorgio Carli","credit_id":"67f22d7baa77e08af799ba4e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1016042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nella Maria Bonora","original_name":"Nella Maria Bonora","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/R4NoMiPAb1jgVSsDlLGOlLpZ30.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elsa","credit_id":"67f22d87aa77e08af799ba58","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1262837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Nucci","original_name":"Laura Nucci","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/i8TcHpBOoR7Xzq08yNb834k36uB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Franca","credit_id":"67f22d93ddf9194387d92489","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5352134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giacomo Gambino","original_name":"Giacomo Gambino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Il piccolo baby","credit_id":"67f22da2ddf9194387d92495","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guglielmo Barnabò","original_name":"Guglielmo Barnabò","popularity":0.1796,"profile_path":"/654SqZTQ4xMwmrFkmlBp8ej21Ow.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Il commendatore","credit_id":"67f22db3eddec28b03ad55cc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5352137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pina Borrione","original_name":"Pina Borrione","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Pina","credit_id":"67f22dcaaa77e08af799ba87","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5352140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppe Duse","original_name":"Giuseppe Duse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"L'investigatore","credit_id":"67f22dd70f20f9c45cad3c1a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":994523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Baron","original_name":"Emma Baron","popularity":0.289,"profile_path":"/tGZGpVyB2LAykQ70jkQZl7SfylD.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Wally","credit_id":"67f22df9eddec28b03ad55d8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Domenico Gambino","original_name":"Domenico Gambino","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/8x3nydrxxJwUMCoRceOI4nn9BC4.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mario","credit_id":"67f22e08eddec28b03ad55e8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5352148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Cattini","original_name":"Elena Cattini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67f22e13aa77e08af799bae3","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1750480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe Guarino","original_name":"Giuseppe Guarino","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f22e24eddec28b03ad5609","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1203572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Domenico Gambino","original_name":"Domenico Gambino","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/8x3nydrxxJwUMCoRceOI4nn9BC4.jpg","credit_id":"67f22e35e1d5c23c6ed9406d","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1275011,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alessandro De Stefani","original_name":"Alessandro De Stefani","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f22e400c791beb57ad87fb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5399,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Otello Martelli","original_name":"Otello Martelli","popularity":0.0587,"profile_path":"/wG9NOQkQ2XX8jiKEbiDLRT7rsrP.jpg","credit_id":"67f22e4beddec28b03ad5649","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1423940,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ezio Carabella","original_name":"Ezio Carabella","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f22e58eddec28b03ad5657","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5352153,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Domenico M.
