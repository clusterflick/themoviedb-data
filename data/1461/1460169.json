HACK=KILL is a stark, minimalist documentary that plunges into the aesthetics, ethics, and consequences of digital labor in the shadowy zones of late capitalist media. At its core is a striking sequence: a hypnotic, real-time camera orbit of a hacker — played with meditative intensity by Audrey Biasucci — as she programs the homepage for the underground cinema collective Zelluloid42.  Set against the raw, industrial pulse of 1990s cyberpunk sound, the film evokes a haunting sense of techno-alienation and underground resistance. Through a single, virtuosic camera movement, it reframes the act of coding as both choreography and subversion, offering an almost phenomenological gaze on digital production.  A meditation on interface, identity, and infrastructure, HACK=KILL is as much an essay as it is a portrait — where hacking becomes cinema, and cinema becomes code.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/jwWVrKkWZjNI7AtOLebtVSz1Rr2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"In a world run by scripts, she writes her own.","title":"HACK=KILL","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5352244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Audrey Biasucci","original_name":"Audrey Biasucci","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Hackeress","credit_id":"67f239760f20f9c45cad3e6e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5352245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tarek Strauch","original_name":"Tarek Strauch","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f2398c0f20f9c45cad3e7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5352245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tarek Strauch","original_name":"Tarek Strauch","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f239a38b1f32eb79d9ad88","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1536,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/jwWVrKkWZjNI7AtOLebtVSz1Rr2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
