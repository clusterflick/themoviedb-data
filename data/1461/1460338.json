The artist scanned herself to let her avatar perform in her stead. The 3D models are studies of organic shapes, while the textures are taken from ornamentally collaged videos of flowers, plants, fruits and vegetables. The background is composed of astro images, adding to a hint of mysticism. The poem is an ironic love poem: Every organism with a cell nucleus is descended from the same eukaryote.","popularity":0.0389,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WE ARE DESCENDED FROM THE SAME EUKARYOTE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3099810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katia Sophia Ditzler","original_name":"Katia Sophia Ditzler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67f29efc7b43bdce20acf6d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EiC","release_date":"2025-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
