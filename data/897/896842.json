On a hike in the sunbathed hills of Berkeley, Chaz talks about the importance of honesty, his dog Michael, and nerding out on skate videos - all of which have influenced his creative manner.  With a focus on the interplay of location and sound, music and visuals, MacRae and Bundick bring the west coast heat to the rest of us. Once the music starts, youâ€™re anywhere but here.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2IZIiwlwAKFpfMsuOE8qo4BuLT1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164246,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Creator Class","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Keep it real, keep it light, and take time to experiment: these are our three lessons in creativity as instructed by Chaz Bundick.","title":"Lessons with Toro y Moi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1717997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chaz Bear","original_name":"Chaz Bear","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"618d1cf77ac8290061d3b410","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3305373,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Tyler","original_name":"Christian Tyler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618d1d1f20e6a5002c4e05fe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3305372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liam MacRae","original_name":"Liam MacRae","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618d1d11a313b80042decfdd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1784813,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kelly Jeffrey","original_name":"Kelly Jeffrey","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618d1d3ae7414600439a2851","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2IZIiwlwAKFpfMsuOE8qo4BuLT1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
