The process of inventing their own bodies and identity are being recorded on the move by their smartphones and shared with their peers from other parts of the networked world. Due to their strong need of external confirmation, they alter their lives into a series of retouched pictures and videos. The film camera, however, captures their feelings of void, loneliness and deep inner insecurities that are not so attractive for Periscope, TikTok or Instagram. An intimate portrait of adolescence is made with full comprehension of experiencing and self-presentation in a generation growing up on the brink of the real and virtual worlds.","popularity":0.823,"poster_path":"/P2nUrcPzmwSbTpejkZh1G2RseX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bloom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fanie Pelletier","original_name":"Fanie Pelletier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618c3df97ac8290061d261aa","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2252934,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon L'Espérance","original_name":"Simon L'Espérance","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618c3ed7a313b8002a972642","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209144,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luc Raymond","original_name":"Luc Raymond","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618c3eea66a7c30092cdf503","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1965066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Félix Lamarche","original_name":"Félix Lamarche","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hixJKlr4S3WuAuwmlMEnAja23lw.jpg","credit_id":"618c3eab6e0d720063d6c903","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2586378,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Wolkow","original_name":"Matthew Wolkow","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618c3e801cfe3a004228faaa","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2794066,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alain Auger","original_name":"Alain Auger","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618c3f0f6e0d720063d6c9d4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2043211,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"René Roberge","original_name":"René Roberge","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618c3ec9d768fe002b80a3e4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2228371,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Audrey D.
