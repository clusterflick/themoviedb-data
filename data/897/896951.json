The disappointed expectations for an exciting evening are quickly transferred to the unexpected encounter and soon the way home becomes a journey through the deserted urban night. Playful flirt turns serious when the man‘s eyes wander to a faint light in the sky. Despite her initial fear that he is romantically gazing at the stars, his eyes are searching the sky for Gegenschein: „the sun casting its shadow in the night“. From a brief moment of intimacy, a mercilessly honest game of questions and answers emerges, which finally ends in a confession: „What‘s the worst thing you‘ve ever done?“","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/n2Ofkug6WYD3uueSE9R2u6SE9KE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gegenschein","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3305820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tobias Artner","original_name":"Tobias Artner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Him","credit_id":"618d6a4db076e50091407ef3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3305817,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victoria Halper","original_name":"Victoria Halper","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Her","credit_id":"618d6a57d768fe00929ecf52","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3305815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kolja Burgschuld","original_name":"Kolja Burgschuld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618d6a19d55e4d008ee53c37","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3305817,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victoria Halper","original_name":"Victoria Halper","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618d6a237ac8290061d436fb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3305814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kai Krösche","original_name":"Kai Krösche","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618d6a3063e6fb008dc99325","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3305815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kolja Burgschuld","original_name":"Kolja Burgschuld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618d6a03c3c89100220d1905","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3305814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kai Krösche","original_name":"Kai Krösche","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618d69f720e6a500443b7d37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3305816,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Stanson","original_name":"James Stanson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618d6a0fcf62cd008c7cf57f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3305816,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Stanson","original_name":"James Stanson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618d6a3c20e6a50066a672d6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3305821,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rupert Kasper","original_name":"Rupert Kasper","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618d6a659a8a8a0043513375","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13551718","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n2Ofkug6WYD3uueSE9R2u6SE9KE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Flickers' Rhode Island International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
