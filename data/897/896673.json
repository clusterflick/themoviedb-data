His attempt to blow up Parliament has seen Guy Fawkes go down in infamy, but the attempted coup was about much more than just one man. Hatched by a group of 13 conspirators, the 1605 plot came after decades of simmering religious tension in England. Fed by an atmosphere of fear and alienation, a group of disaffected young Catholics decided to assassinate King James I and the entire political establishment.  Now with the help of CGI to recreate early 17th-century London, see how much damage would have been caused by the explosion, while dramatic reconstructions uncover the men behind the plan and explore what drove them to radicalism.","popularity":0.0807,"poster_path":"/6danugJZ5AToeImwscor5EHCaOO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gunpowder Plot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4358854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Hogge","original_name":"Alice Hogge","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Presenter/Narrator","credit_id":"6547a72cfd4f8000ae2b0cff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1253996,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Antonia Fraser","original_name":"Antonia Fraser","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":"/u3kbjChOuGel5Uu5g83ZoyaUYMC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6547a73b9cc67b00c444111a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1254062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diarmaid MacCulloch","original_name":"Diarmaid MacCulloch","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/j5fqKAEKv3NTdv8Hy9uzI5I1rPc.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6547a7ef924ce600e53f45bb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2221118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alison Weir","original_name":"Alison Weir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6547a8926beaea00c9fca56b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4358861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Croft","original_name":"Pauline Croft","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6547a7c9d55c3d00e2127138","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4358865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Somerset","original_name":"Anne Somerset","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6547a81941a561336a22f409","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4358867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Nicholls","original_name":"Mark Nicholls","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6547a83e924ce600e53f45e4","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4358889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Murray","original_name":"Steve Murray","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6547ad7f2866fa00c4249106","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Wadding","original_name":"Michael Wadding","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618ca213cb6db5008d624425","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Wadding","original_name":"Michael Wadding","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640513a543999b00d6575a54","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6danugJZ5AToeImwscor5EHCaOO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
