Shot using a tiny, pocket sized digital camera. \"I initially didn't intend to make a video from them or have them shown publicly. I was just making a diary of moments that I found graceful during the frequent downtime that occurs when traveling. My partner, Abigail Smith, created a large collection of field recordings during this same time, some of which were later published under the title \"Indochina Soundscraps\". And although the two projects stand-alone, I think they compliment each other in attitude and approach - which works well as a metaphor for our relationship.\"","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/qEhWrJXs1hm5I7dA3i4opBj5RBC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"easy to learn hard to forget","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2899181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Rhody","original_name":"Justin Rhody","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618bea336e0d72004248116d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qEhWrJXs1hm5I7dA3i4opBj5RBC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Film Diary NYC","release_date":"2021-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
