Since she has no money of her own, the only way she can think of raising the funds is to marry someone wealthy. When she gets the attention of Michael Ordsay (Jack Holt), she quickly asks him to marry her. It seems to be a mismatch, so Mira obtains the needed money from his kindly father (Tom Guise), and heads for Rome, where she undergoes voice training and becomes an operatic star.","popularity":0.1446,"poster_path":"/nKi5yPGBDrWhdOTUI5qLPfwxHt0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164069,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bessie Barriscale Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Woman Michael Married","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1371716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bessie Barriscale","original_name":"Bessie Barriscale","popularity":0.1105,"profile_path":"/ajsGYDEx28oG76cK4WibgdgtyDt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mira Sacky","credit_id":"618ae8521cfe3a002a4fa578","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Holt","original_name":"Jack Holt","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":"/4xfh3Mlpqx8tZ991rhVTov0ILtN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Michael Ordsway","credit_id":"618ae860d55e4d0029335fa0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1170316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcia Manon","original_name":"Marcia Manon","popularity":0.0669,"profile_path":"/sCmbJrJB4Fbs00PzvIQEfLPTaF6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Doris Steele","credit_id":"618ae86de93e95008e994702","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Guise","original_name":"Tom Guise","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/bXTQvjO4qKwiWlvobaBb3klmqdi.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ordsway Sr","credit_id":"618ae87a534661002ab15e51","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles West","original_name":"Charles West","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/b83aIQMnrWmXxnYm5vbPI1izN7u.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Harvey Kirkland","credit_id":"618ae889d55e4d0029335fab","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonnie Hill","original_name":"Bonnie Hill","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/m5bBQxEdv3YaUQ7bnxE4M6hmIXB.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Leila, Princess Marchesi","credit_id":"618ae8a21cfe3a004226ad05","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3303206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron C.
