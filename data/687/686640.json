On October 16, 2018, an unprecedented operation targeted Jean-Luc Mélenchon and his family: 15 searches were carried out simultaneously by a hundred prosecutors and police directly under the orders of the Ministry of Justice. Unheard of in France. The prosecutor who orchestrated this operation, François Molins, close to President Emmanuel Macron, was rewarded less than a month later by being appointed to the highest office of the judiciary. This film carefully documents the facts that make this case an emblematic case of lawfare.","popularity":0.1297,"poster_path":"/AcREKeub2DuK8JyJpbpu1MUe0yJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lawfare : le cas Mélenchon","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1407549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Luc Mélenchon","original_name":"Jean-Luc Mélenchon","popularity":0.0744,"profile_path":"/diYO0n2toAZwDg658LyO6wWnTT7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e7cb451109dec1cbb01d2f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5249975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Régis de Castelnau","original_name":"Régis de Castelnau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67b1a519933055a2e26db60d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5249976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Gontier","original_name":"Samuel Gontier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67b1a51f8127362af76db6e1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5249977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Langlois","original_name":"Alexandre Langlois","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67b1a525e5e1a7ed7ce0d7c5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3126732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillaume Long","original_name":"Guillaume Long","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/k6T2LZsvLt46oaNB09RJak5reTN.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67b1a52c169e365af69fa0c6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4154720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antoine Léaument","original_name":"Antoine Léaument","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/cY4eHPOnzaKk0j7OFFJUZAKP9k9.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67b1a532e5e1a7ed7ce0d7cf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5249978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Marais","original_name":"David Marais","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67b1a538933055a2e26db625","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3704817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Younous Omarjee","original_name":"Younous Omarjee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67b1a53d169e365af69fa0d2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3185251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Pignerol","original_name":"Bernard Pignerol","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/aezue6HJRlzUHcCs0yqv0qOvA7e.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"67b1a544933055a2e26db62c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5249979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaël Quirante","original_name":"Gaël Quirante","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"67b1a54c8127362af76db6ee","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5249981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christophe Ventura","original_name":"Christophe Ventura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"67b1a568169e365af69fa0e3","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3205280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophia Chikirou","original_name":"Sophia Chikirou","popularity":0.0481,"profile_path":"/dbG8CMWBd8nvNpsgdH2bk0dD18q.jpg","credit_id":"67b1a507169e365af69fa09a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5249974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Marie Vaude","original_name":"Jean-Marie Vaude","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b1a50f8127362af76db6c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5249983,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christophe Couderc","original_name":"Christophe Couderc","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b1a57de5e1a7ed7ce0d7fb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5249984,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robin Vollais","original_name":"Robin Vollais","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b1a586169e365af69fa0fe","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11476768","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AcREKeub2DuK8JyJpbpu1MUe0yJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1131}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
