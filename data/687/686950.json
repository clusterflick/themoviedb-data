Sudan, who passed away in March 2018 at the age of 45, which owes its name to his birthplace, was the last of these specimens. For a long time he lived in the Zoo of Dv? R Králové, in the Czech Republic, losing due to the cold the possibility to procreate and continue his species, later in a nature reserve in Nanyuki, Kenya. Protected by armed guards, the target captures him moving slowly in one of the widest horizons in the world. Trevisani films it in close-ups, highlighting its rough skin almost a plastic work of art with an unusual sculptural charm. The video camera paints the blurred and barely mentioned portraits of the soldiers intent on monitoring their movements day and night and advances on his body, sketching the image of a dying work of art that is going towards its slow extinction.","popularity":0.0493,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sudan, Interview To a Body","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
