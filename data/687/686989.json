We follow them during their last days of a young love, which is strong one moment, fragile the next. One moment is filled with kisses and happy summer days on roller skates, the next is marked by division and sleepless nights. Victoria Francker's film provides an intimate insight into the most vulnerable sides of a relationship. The two young girls would so much like to have the perfect relationship, but they are filled with insecurity and unrealistic expectations of what it should be like. Francker integrates the girls' own personal footage from their time together in her both intimate and fragile film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Moments","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2347277,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victoria Francker","original_name":"Victoria Francker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7e134c6c849200146bc82a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
