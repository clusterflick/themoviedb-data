There has been, for many years, a labour migration from across Nepal to India ’s cities. This short film is set in the underground parking lot of an apartment building in Bangalore, in South India. One Way follows the livelihood of a security guard named Shyam Bahadur, who lives with the rest of his family in the electric switching room of an apartment block, to whom he provides service for the sake of survival. The narrative of the journey he made 35 years ago, from the mountains of Nepal to the southern plateau of Bangalore, punctuates his day-to-day life in and out of the basement. As his personal story unfolds, the hills of Nepal are being rocked by “the people’s war,” yet another historical disturbances that has forced Nepalis to emigrate for work.","popularity":0.0544,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Way","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1086839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shyam Bahadur","original_name":"Shyam Bahadur","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"661715693cd12c016371f018","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1082915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ayisha Abraham","original_name":"Ayisha Abraham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/kXusyieONLZgDecA8WHXowC30kI.jpg","credit_id":"5e7d4083278d8a0015725c30","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cannes Film Festival","release_date":"2007-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"one way short","key":"xfgSzsxFvYo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-11-22T11:12:50.000Z","id":"66171515869e7501637ffc76"}]}}}
