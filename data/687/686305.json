Jun-young and Sung-jun may have something unusual, but they are bored with their daily routines. Then one day, Sung-jun learned about an invitation-only blind party from a junior in the company. Is there any reason for any man not to go?  The place was full of excitement. Jun-yeong opened the door and while the place looked so much different, he could still recognize it instantly.  One day without any word, a woman, Na-young, disappeared like a smoke. Because of a rule that he cannot ask anything, he ended up having sex with Na-young, and just like that, she disappears. Jun-yeong couldn’t tell if he’s dreaming or not. When he met Sung-jun and talked about what happened, Sung-joon will give him the contact details of the blind party organizer. After much thought, he finally contacted the host to see Na-young again. Na-young waits for Jun-yeong in the hotel room. How will the night be for Na-young and Jun-yeong?","popularity":0.9674,"poster_path":"/3nL1uAjVRgzBzrJCPYi9xIkaa7r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blind Partner","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2578378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Im Cho-hee","original_name":"Im Cho-hee","popularity":2.2558,"profile_path":"/4x5I4R6jDEcwPoPZnetzPA57ZNd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e7b743bab1bc70017c18e80","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2472427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tae Joo","original_name":"Tae Joo","popularity":0.3264,"profile_path":"/4QIDt296jCFXhpjxT5GDZAeLb21.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e7b74439e401200100524d7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2578379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sung Yeon","original_name":"Sung Yeon","popularity":3.0847,"profile_path":"/3Axwq4OrAsYaRuaNuFPpnu07TMZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e7b7452ab1bc70017c18e9b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1907998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kang Min-woo","original_name":"Kang Min-woo","popularity":2.1634,"profile_path":"/pIrr35CLdzsL5Gt7nGgP8lumv9a.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e7b745c8c44b900154e79f9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2576502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gil Dong","original_name":"Gil Dong","popularity":0.4788,"profile_path":"/dhbMFoJZII43IihAfdHQIBOMZTC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65b7680f9ba86a0162f919be","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2578381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Ro-woon","original_name":"Lee Ro-woon","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7b747d9e4012001205316c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dQBY9tj1mH1EvvpDcG8UxzLAQHc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1054,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3nL1uAjVRgzBzrJCPYi9xIkaa7r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":740}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":155477,"name":"softcore"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"19+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
