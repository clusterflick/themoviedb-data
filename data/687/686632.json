Set in a virtual tech-noir urban space populated by strange hybrids of non-humans and augmented people, part of the expansive, fractured narrative focuses on the continued adventures of Xanax Girl and her search for her companion—a hybrid dog/seal with the head of a boy—who has been abducted. The film, which arose from the artist’s daily practice of animating his dreams using hobbyist 3D software, weaves together deep-web imagery with hardboiled detective story tropes and repressed libidinal fantasies to create a nightmarish vision of an internet addict’s unconscious. The film features an original score by Oneohtrix Point Never and James Ferraro.","popularity":0.2864,"poster_path":"/zAN2mu6n8I6QYpy24mpTooAZ9ls.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream Journal 2016–2019","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Rafman","original_name":"Jon Rafman","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/5ouiqddcOWIAyReiu4aLwi2dSkf.jpg","credit_id":"64435c0eb3f6f504f49e48d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Rafman","original_name":"Jon Rafman","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/5ouiqddcOWIAyReiu4aLwi2dSkf.jpg","credit_id":"64435c14651fcf045e9cf459","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Rafman","original_name":"Jon Rafman","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/5ouiqddcOWIAyReiu4aLwi2dSkf.jpg","credit_id":"5e7caed1d861af2f0ab7e1ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1325093,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Lopatin","original_name":"Daniel Lopatin","popularity":0.1321,"profile_path":"/rEAJCxyxx3nAAxGBzR922n1t9R4.jpg","credit_id":"5f277a12869e75003668981a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1340927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Ferraro","original_name":"James Ferraro","popularity":0.1496,"profile_path":"/z0XfrluPoKs0JTAYqZV1Gyhv614.jpg","credit_id":"5f277a53efe37c0036be5b6b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13143740","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iNfbA8AlhflxUsHaShTOY0BV4UW.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yvBS0agVGfIhWE1qHWT6gGlBqz8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gf024gFjps28K5pAD2dhkDUg5uS.jpg","vote_average":8.034,"vote_count":5,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":901,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nIIedcuWew4vOOgqS5LqngqHLX3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":601},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zAN2mu6n8I6QYpy24mpTooAZ9ls.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4563,"name":"virtual reality"},{"id":278823,"name":"3d animation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Dream Journal 2016 - 2019 (clip), Jon Rafman","key":"nAVH-6agkqw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2018-02-27T08:45:57.000Z","id":"64435c8dad87f7046dccb5da"}]}}}
