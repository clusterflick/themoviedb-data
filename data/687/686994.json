But due to the restrictions on their freedom of movement, a majority of Palestinians have for decades been denied access to the coast. In a simple but original and meaningful way, Martin Johannsen lets his protagonists recount their memories and ideas of the sea with their eyes closed, as if they had fallen into a trance-like dream. The sea becomes a mirror for reflection, where they talk about their relationship to water through living imagery. Some have never forgotten their only encounter with the sea, while others can only fantasise about what it looks like in reality.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/cQNpluTWK87usXxde6oxvYKbTeF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What the Sea Forget","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580610,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Johannsen","original_name":"Martin Johannsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7e1549109dec1cbb038c22","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cQNpluTWK87usXxde6oxvYKbTeF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
