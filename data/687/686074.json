She not only recorded the everyday life of her immediate surroundings, but also life in the bomb-destroyed city of Dortmund and the later reconstruction after 1945 with the camera and thus captured it for posterity. But there are also industrial, commercial and travel films as well as reports in her work.","popularity":0.0865,"poster_path":"/UEgBLUlBk4g1CNv0v1Wt13J8UA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131058,"logo_path":null,"name":"LWL MedienZentrum Westphalen","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Erich, lass mal laufen!: Die Filme der Elisabeth Wilms","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2577353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Wilms","original_name":"Elisabeth Wilms","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/AaxNKJFxtrN4JPGGiF1PA7spHtK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e7a2d74a055ef001631dcda","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1129663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Klauß","original_name":"Jürgen Klauß","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e7a2d8bd18b24001783aa9d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36791,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Lentz","original_name":"Michael Lentz","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e7a2d9ea055ef001231f2f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claus Bredenbrock","original_name":"Claus Bredenbrock","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e7a2db0cabfe4001525062a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2577353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Wilms","original_name":"Elisabeth Wilms","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/AaxNKJFxtrN4JPGGiF1PA7spHtK.jpg","credit_id":"5e7a2dc4a055ef001231f333","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2577353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Wilms","original_name":"Elisabeth Wilms","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/AaxNKJFxtrN4JPGGiF1PA7spHtK.jpg","credit_id":"5e7a2dd0357c000011556da3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2174109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claus Bredenbrock","original_name":"Claus Bredenbrock","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7a2ddf2f3b17001155f8ce","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36791,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Lentz","original_name":"Michael Lentz","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7a2deecabfe4001326e10b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1129663,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jürgen Klauß","original_name":"Jürgen Klauß","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7a2e072f3b17001956f921","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12022812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3caaAax0wR4zsqYdOSVFSP29yTw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/UEgBLUlBk4g1CNv0v1Wt13J8UA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
