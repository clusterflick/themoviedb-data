The film employs a unique mix of visual elements along with voice over narration to juxtapose memories of the filmmaker's past against stories of three gay South Asian men living in the diaspora. Overshadowing these nostalgic explorations of life 'back home,' are harsh realities of homophobia and racism in America and an on-going struggle to find a place of belonging.","popularity":0.0484,"poster_path":"/kl2qharj7vKxlzfJjsEqWlbwdbU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Milind Soman Made Me Gay","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2465947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harjant Gill","original_name":"Harjant Gill","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7d4333fea0d772afc93aac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1123397","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kl2qharj7vKxlzfJjsEqWlbwdbU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
