They also share the entire universe that they have built together in the performative Japaneses role-playing universe, where they can live out other sides of themselves. We experience the two young people 'in character' and in full makeup, but also when they share pillows with each other in their intimate and private 'backstage' home in their apartment. Victoria Salomonsen's 'Jeg er en anden' is a stylish and psychologically astute film about being young in a performative age, where you have the freedom to be yourself and someone else â€“ if only you have the courage too.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/kz8FULA24MlEcAyRvUlRYacUkDJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am An Other","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580608,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vixtoria Vogel Salomonsen","original_name":"Vixtoria Vogel Salomonsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7e14aa109dec1ebb03f71b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kz8FULA24MlEcAyRvUlRYacUkDJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":678}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
