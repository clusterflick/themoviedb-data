Naruto appears to be an overbearing sis-con. In fact, he's madly in love with Anzu, because they're not blood-related. He confines her to the family mansion for \"security,\" depriving her of companionship and a real life. At age 16, she starts to rebel. She smuggles in a kitten as a pet (Naruto hates cats) and then escapes in a delivery truck. Naruto catches up to her and realizes that she can't be confined like a bird in a cage. He agrees to let have a normal life, but just then, tragedy strikes","popularity":1.4089,"poster_path":"/A31I0zxHM4u7REQZoxhTuiBEKx8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1999-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Juliet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ジュリエット","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Juliet","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Juliet Das Geheimnis","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":933722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kae Araki","original_name":"荒木香衣","popularity":0.6138,"profile_path":"/cxTyiRskkgUpQfZrCw7zpkocV5I.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Anne Nozaki","credit_id":"5e7a6712a0b690001321b1cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kentaro Ito","original_name":"伊藤健太郎","popularity":0.8816,"profile_path":"/fIoreUBVEWcRLZanJlHUSQAjpeE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mio","credit_id":"5e7a672aa055ef001232440a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jin Yamanoi","original_name":"山野井仁","popularity":0.4236,"profile_path":"/sYo0kbKrEN3WPXs7TyHGyekeo8J.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Naruto Nozaki","credit_id":"5e7a674c9a643500132c2afa","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1451472,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Toshimitsu Kobayashi","original_name":"小林利充","popularity":0.2653,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7a677ca055ef001232443b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Character Designer"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":84413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tsuneo Tominaga","original_name":"冨永恒雄","popularity":1.089,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7a67632f3b17001156400c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":780,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A31I0zxHM4u7REQZoxhTuiBEKx8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6152,"name":"supernatural"},{"id":13141,"name":"based on manga"},{"id":195669,"name":"ecchi"},{"id":210024,"name":"anime"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"1999-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
