They were forcibly placed in a closed institution to be studied, measured and weighed – exactly in the way that nature itself was starting to be examined around the same time. Today, the place is a research centre. A young female scientist collects samples on the island, while the whispering voices of the past and never-sent letters echo in the empty hallways.","popularity":0.2071,"poster_path":"/3A6fU3lDfEWbxHbO02jnlfTUZBU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16214,"logo_path":"/uPBm0dQNLBQ6CLbigDonXqKkA9Z.png","name":"Made","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":2396,"logo_path":"/v0U7OZwjgv2vmiHbS2HNqjX9MEc.png","name":"Finnish Film Foundation","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2020-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Själö - Island of Souls","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2435174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lotta Petronella","original_name":"Lotta Petronella","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7c964b13a320321726e4ca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2579247,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Seppo Parkkinen","original_name":"Seppo Parkkinen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7c965afea0d772afc8536e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1365170,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ulla Simonen","original_name":"Ulla Simonen","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7c967a6c74b94e95ca2ccb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2435174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lotta Petronella","original_name":"Lotta Petronella","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7c963c13a32046b7272486","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1295701,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lau Nau","original_name":"Lau Nau","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7c96aed861af28c0b799a2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2301620,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Johanna Tarvainen","original_name":"Johanna Tarvainen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7c968f109dec1ebb01ef97","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2262139,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lotta Mäki","original_name":"Lotta Mäki","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7c9711ab1bc75cb1c25837","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124864,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Janne Laine","original_name":"Janne Laine","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":"/7RMPfxYRGusRg2KDyMLr1xUxbq9.jpg","credit_id":"5e7c96e4d861af312ab7cbb4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2267666,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ilona Tolmunen","original_name":"Ilona Tolmunen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7c969b6c74b95757ca162a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1593714,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matti Näränen","original_name":"Matti Näränen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7c96cb13a320321726e5c1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124864,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Janne Laine","original_name":"Janne Laine","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":"/7RMPfxYRGusRg2KDyMLr1xUxbq9.jpg","credit_id":"5e7c96f46c74b94ca5ca13fa","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2234087,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kerttu Hakkarainen","original_name":"Kerttu Hakkarainen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f69c637c1ffbd0036dbee76","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10965308","wikidata_id":"Q111854306","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1410,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3A6fU3lDfEWbxHbO02jnlfTUZBU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CPH DOX","release_date":"2020-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Netflix","release_date":"2022-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SJÄLÖ   ISLAND OF SOULS ➟ Documentary Film ➟ Roots Nepal","key":"GeVyGthZfVU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-03-15T07:50:33.000Z","id":"64161fb731032500e8a1c9d5"}]}}}
