The content of a book is hidden within an existing book – \"The Knight in the Panther's Skin\" written by Medieval Georgian poet Shota Rustaveli who dedicated the book to 12th century Queen Tamar who at the time brought prosperity and many social changes in the country. Being used as a secret shell or a reference to female power from the past, the freshly embedded content of a book serves as manifesto to the women who haven’t been equally appreciated due to history books still being written from male perspective. The book offers alternative gaze to a world history which can exist only in utopian science-fiction film commissioned and executed by females only.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/avUXsIJNiJVeyENhg0h2GJsCHbV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2019-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Commission","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3575112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gvantsa Jishkariani","original_name":"Gvantsa Jishkariani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/dB6C1BRtuUMKRwuoPd48RijR7Oq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Writer","credit_id":"629ab11fec0c58006686b432","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2271589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ieva Balode","original_name":"Ieva Balode","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/vzHNi4jyPrDPIyaJe2XTWO86C0D.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Courier","credit_id":"629ab12a5507e9149757e3ab","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3575113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Solvita Krese","original_name":"Solvita Krese","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Minister","credit_id":"629ab133dc1cb4009bb87c2a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3575115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inga Lāce","original_name":"Inga Lāce","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/3nr5E0LOn1YHrrHu7wbPrtwu2S8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Scientist","credit_id":"629ab14d7ad08c009ea65de9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3575120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andra Silapētere","original_name":"Andra Silapētere","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/qsFUOnGMabnV31Kc9uZzjedbURo.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Engineer","credit_id":"629ab2c73faba0009b267e1a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3575118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renata Vitola","original_name":"Renata Vitola","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Assistant","credit_id":"629ab2af68188800659c082b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2271589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ieva Balode","original_name":"Ieva Balode","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/vzHNi4jyPrDPIyaJe2XTWO86C0D.jpg","credit_id":"5e7bd3d3fea0d710f5c751cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":913,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/67STj3HYqr1GpHIteDUPd6nBSgh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":609},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/avUXsIJNiJVeyENhg0h2GJsCHbV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Analogica","release_date":"2020-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
