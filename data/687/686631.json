But the dream is almost impossible to realise, as Rekha's family is planning to marry her off to a young boy in the neighbouring village. 'The Beloved Daughter' is a colourful but delicate tale about how poverty and cultural traditions force Rekha's father to send her away from the family and make her step into adulthood at a far too early age. For even though child marriage is prohibited by law – even in Nepal – the tradition is still widespread and responsible for determining the fate of children like Rekha all over the world.","popularity":0.0894,"poster_path":"/bSVtWu2SdPWe3MOzFR6d5yHFm3w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131165,"logo_path":null,"name":"Icebreaker Productions","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":2396,"logo_path":"/v0U7OZwjgv2vmiHbS2HNqjX9MEc.png","name":"Finnish Film Foundation","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2020-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beloved Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Nepalin morsian","type":"Finland (alternative title)"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2579378,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiina Madisson","original_name":"Tiina Madisson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7cae63fea0d708fec871e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2579378,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tiina Madisson","original_name":"Tiina Madisson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7cae6a13a32016dc26f939","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2579379,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kirsi Mattila","original_name":"Kirsi Mattila","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/getHHkKBY6bUWnR8zV08V1q8CGe.jpg","credit_id":"5e7cae88109dec213c01e484","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10967954","wikidata_id":"Q98726003","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bSVtWu2SdPWe3MOzFR6d5yHFm3w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Beloved Daughter Trailer | CPH:DOX 2020","key":"yazAMEfZyhs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-02-20T11:00:14.000Z","id":"5e7caf4afea0d772afc876b2"}]}}}
