Using an approach that could be considered ethnographic, David Dudouit commits to showing us the everyday life of the island and its inhabitants. As the days repeat, the filmmaker sometimes returns to the same places filmed the day before. As a result of the frame-by-frame shooting method, time becomes compressed, and the rhythm of the film pulls us into a kind of trance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rj8gwxUE0Hb6usTCihK9xcZ8xrY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Île de Sein","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2120347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Dudouit","original_name":"David Dudouit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7c7629d861af2f0ab7903b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rj8gwxUE0Hb6usTCihK9xcZ8xrY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
