For the three people we meet here, the street is also their second home. 48-year-old Mette, 34-year-old Wesley and 26-year-old Danny share a drug addiction and a harsh upbringing in common. But they are also human beings with a story to tell, and in 'Gaden' we are for once told the stories from them directly, and over the course of two years. Their escape, the drugs and their unconventional community â€“ with Istedgade as the rough background which ties their (life) stories together.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gaden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580574,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ole Tornbjerg","original_name":"Ole Tornbjerg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7e101e278d8a0015738b84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Voldborg Andersen","original_name":"Christian Voldborg Andersen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7e1029278d8a0013738c0e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11914634","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
