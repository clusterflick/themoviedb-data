For her, human faces are no bastion of trust, but places of fear and confusion. She is one of the 1% of all people whose part of the brain responsible for facial recognition does not work properly. With his film LOST IN FACE, neuroscientist Valentin Riedl travels through Carlotta's universe, full of anthropomorphic animals, lucid dreams and bumpy false paths. He peels back her charming, idiosyncratic solutions that she employs to be able to join the masses of human conformity, until she one day decides to build a ship and leave her fellow humans. Her never-ending search for answers leads her to art-and thus an avenue to her own face and back to humanity.","popularity":0.0468,"poster_path":"/iFbV93JSZRL3p1WwZ926HlvIEo2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost in Face","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2003811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valentin Riedl","original_name":"Valentin Riedl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7e06bd6c74b94ca5cb8584","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11350504","wikidata_id":"Q96781942","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iFbV93JSZRL3p1WwZ926HlvIEo2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":709}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
