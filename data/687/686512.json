Performing with deadpan precision, he moves his hands, arms and entire body in studied, minute motions, intoning the phrase \"I am making art\" with each gesture. Each articulation of the phrase is given a different emphasis and nuance, as if art were being created from moment to moment. This index of body movements is ironically offset by the repetitive monotony of the exercise.","popularity":0.2915,"poster_path":"/aVGV3snuvahfNWrgRMqTghVuLdC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Making Art","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1366997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Baldessari","original_name":"John Baldessari","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/hkB0IlAKqzDNJlE83ubQSR1ZVpy.jpg","credit_id":"5e7c1e22ab1bc75874c18eea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aVGV3snuvahfNWrgRMqTghVuLdC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208015,"name":"conceptual art"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
