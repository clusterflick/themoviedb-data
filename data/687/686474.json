Two years later a newlywed couple moves into this house and they start to experience some supernatural occurrences from the very first day, but the couple also believes there are not alone in this house. A year later an alcoholic writer moves into this house to begin an investigation about the disappearance of his daughter that coincidently happened to be around the same time Mark and his entire family were murder. He uncovers what really happened to his daughter and the reason this house is possessed by dead people, but he also discovers who's behind all the tragedy and the horrendous murders that had happened all these years in the same house. The local priest believes this house is evil and he wants no part of it as he also believes everyone who dies in this house, their soul leaves their bodies, but their bodies never leave the house.
