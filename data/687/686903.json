Among them are women from Ciudad Juárez who cross to give birth in El Paso, Texas. Even with visas that allow them to cross, their journeys are uncertain. Gaby and Luisa, two women from Ciudad Juárez, cross legally into El Paso, Texas, in order to give birth. Two Chicana midwives in El Paso, Lina and Sandra, support the women who cross. After living through the extreme violence that engulfed Ciudad Juárez from 2008-2012 and with the looming threat of obstetrical violence in Mexican hospitals, Gaby and Luisa choose to cross, seeking a safer future for their children and the opportunity for natural childbirth with midwives. They risk losing their visas, getting turned back, and harassment at the hands of U.S. Border Patrol. Against the backdrop of oppressive U.S. border policy, these women's stories of risk and resilience reveal the complexities of life on the U.S.-Mexico border.","popularity":0.2184,"poster_path":"/hXYPQqTV2TYb2VFNkNxiStjGPvR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birth on the border","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2703404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ellie Lobovits","original_name":"Ellie Lobovits","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f02a8fa7caa470035e2bfea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8417012","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hXYPQqTV2TYb2VFNkNxiStjGPvR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3725,"name":"pregnancy"},{"id":1900,"name":"immigration"},{"id":5616,"name":"usa–mexico border"},{"id":6420,"name":"border crossing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Screenings at San Antonio CineFestival, Femme Frontera Film Festival and others","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
