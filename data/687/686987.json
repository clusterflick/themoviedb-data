But today, he has to embark on a very different project. After falling in love with a Danish woman, he ends up a stay-at-home dad of two toddlers in Copenhagen, and his own boring life as a caregiver becomes his only object of study. Once unable to conform to a conventional lifestyle, he now discovers the few joys and many hardships of child rearing, as well as the bizarre culture of hygge that surrounds him. Abandoned by his mother as a kid, Brendan swore to never inflict the same trauma on his children, but he suddenly understands the prison she found herself in: “We need to find another word than love for this,” he ponders. Filmed over five years, this tragicomic diary is a relatable, taboo-free look at the exquisite torture of parenthood.","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":"/d2N39gSnz9V58r2QUeVqU5K9EMk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daddy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brendan Cooney","original_name":"Brendan Cooney","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6022faf8abdec0003ee00ded","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ida Buhl","original_name":"Ida Buhl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6022fb0795c0af003e532483","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951196,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lars Emil Leonhard","original_name":"Lars Emil Leonhard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6022fb36ef9d72003e55a274","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brendan Cooner","original_name":"Brendan Cooner","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6022fb4ddd25890040bb853f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2405466,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sune Kaarsberg","original_name":"Sune Kaarsberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6022fb64458199003fabadf0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951196,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lars Emil Leonhard","original_name":"Lars Emil Leonhard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6022fb3bea37e0003e41b38d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":111140,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vibeke Vogel","original_name":"Vibeke Vogel","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6022fb5ac5ada5003e7cf8a8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brendan Cooner","original_name":"Brendan Cooner","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6022fb45ef9d72004155babc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2951196,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lars Emil Leonhard","original_name":"Lars Emil Leonhard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6022fb295690b50041242bc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4wdEgAEqrygbJh1vsZkWfXJxiTn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d2N39gSnz9V58r2QUeVqU5K9EMk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"7th Peloponnisos International Doc Film Festival","release_date":"2021-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
