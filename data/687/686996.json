Her most recent work is a portrait, and a new variation on her method. Before the camera, we encounter the formidable 87 year-old artist Margaret Rasp√© who works in photography, film, drawing and other art forms. Regardless of the medium, automatisms play a significant role in her art. Nissen transcends the traditional limits of the portrait genre and has created a congenial and loving tribute to a unique creative mind.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":"/1RQcLK5MLi65AegjLSHe2uMRub3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There Is","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lena Ditte Nissen","original_name":"Lena Ditte Nissen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7e15d3fea0d708feca86f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1RQcLK5MLi65AegjLSHe2uMRub3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Experiments in Cinema","release_date":"2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
