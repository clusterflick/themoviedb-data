On this apparently destination-free journey, the block is transformed into an elegant classical column; the craftsmen are several Chinese artisans, who work decisively and masterfully, excluding any possibility of error; the marble-dust powders their faces, and whitens the ship’s bridge.  The story of this event, which Paci “allowed to happen” on board a factory-ship, becomes an eloquent visual metaphor, which, through art, touches themes such as work and cultural identity and, in the economic context, social and global dynamics.  This is the Albanian artist’s most involved work, as far as production’s concerned, and also his most stratified, and most loaded with symbolic references. In his video, “everything flows”, in fact, around the column as architectural element, which, taking form, represents the dialogue between East and West.","popularity":0.0819,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Column","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"An Jianjun","original_name":"An Jianjun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Stone Carver","credit_id":"5e7de2696c849200166b6f13","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lu Chunyu","original_name":"Lu Chunyu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Stone Carver","credit_id":"5e7de2756c849200166b6f23","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jia Lihui","original_name":"Jia Lihui","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Stone Carver","credit_id":"5e7de2806c74b94e95cbfd9b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jia Lijun","original_name":"Jia Lijun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Stone Carver","credit_id":"5e7de288109dec1ebb039c2d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liu Xiaopo","original_name":"Liu Xiaopo","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Stone Carver","credit_id":"5e7de293278d8a0015734a17","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1963185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Paci","original_name":"Adrian Paci","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7cdbfb13a32016dc272996","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580400,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Beatrice Girelli","original_name":"Beatrice Girelli","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7de1e3278d8a0013734604","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580401,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Leo Cui","original_name":"Leo Cui","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7de1eff794ad0011eff08f","department":"Editing","job":"Project Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580403,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"An Shaoying","original_name":"An Shaoying","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7de23c6c74b95757cbf75c","department":"Editing","job":"Project Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580404,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zhang Fenghuai","original_name":"Zhang Fenghuai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7de24afea0d708feca172d","department":"Editing","job":"Project Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580398,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Erfort Kuke","original_name":"Erfort Kuke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7de1a76c74b94ca5cb6880","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580402,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Niu","original_name":"David Niu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7de2286c74b95757cbf74e","department":"Production","job":"Assistant Unit Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580399,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Arenc Kasharaj","original_name":"Arenc Kasharaj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7de1c96c849200126b6685","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11238742","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
