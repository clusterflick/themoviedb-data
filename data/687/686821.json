They reached the shores of the Mediterranean in a state of exhaustion, and were loaded onto shady ships and ended up as slaves at North African markets. The film snatches the stirring fate of these children from the realm of the forgotten and gives them back their dignity on the pages of history.","popularity":0.2488,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":131203,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zauberberg Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Child Crusades - Barefoot to the Promised Land","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1932482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Tipping","original_name":"Steve Tipping","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e7d27d6d861af2f0ab85fb1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1408520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martin Papirowski","original_name":"Martin Papirowski","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7d27c613a32046b727fa94","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254,"name":"france"},{"id":74,"name":"germany"},{"id":2868,"name":"crusade"},{"id":215160,"name":"13th century"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
