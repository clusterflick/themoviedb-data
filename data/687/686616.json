The short works link thematically in their investigations into human-vehicle relationships. Whether performing instructional poetry in the garage, documenting the interiors of strangersâ€™ cars, or celebrating art world connections to the road, the work balances a playful humor with a critical eye on where society is currently parked.","popularity":0.0521,"poster_path":"/qfMrteAdcLno6khiloArEfm3fw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emotions in Metal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tommy Becker","original_name":"Tommy Becker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7ca5db13a32046b7273963","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qfMrteAdcLno6khiloArEfm3fw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bow Arts: Visions in the Nunnery","release_date":"2020-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moviate Underground Film Festival","release_date":"2020-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
