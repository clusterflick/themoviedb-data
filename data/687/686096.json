During the dictatorship, this building was the most progressive Catholic seminary in Portugal. António, the front door neighbor, was brought up and raised a family in its shadow. Ever since the Dominican priests left, he has been its most faithful caretaker - keeper of ghosts, memories, and hallways now emptied of life. Abandoned for years, the town's former epicenter now hopes for a new life.","popularity":0.0874,"poster_path":"/9110KoDyI8sC6xC7vSYoPvWZMCV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2021-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Old House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2577490,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filipe Araújo","original_name":"Filipe Araújo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62867642f10a1a0066be23e8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2577490,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filipe Araújo","original_name":"Filipe Araújo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62867646bf09d10068e86f03","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2577490,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filipe Araújo","original_name":"Filipe Araújo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628676549ca7593366005ae2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3555901,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hemi Fortes","original_name":"Hemi Fortes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6286765a2495ab00654fcbb9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2002126,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Francisco Costa","original_name":"Francisco Costa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62867665e004a600660c5a06","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2577490,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Filipe Araújo","original_name":"Filipe Araújo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7a4cf0a055ef0012322168","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11984548","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/arN1eRSkelB3mpmi5ZrwnjQW3I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1777}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9110KoDyI8sC6xC7vSYoPvWZMCV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
