Acknowledged as a key figure in the early music revival, he is the founder and artistic director of the Monteverdi Choir, the English Baroque Soloists and the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique. The extent of his repertoire is illustrated in over 250 recordings which have received numerous international awards. Over the years Gardiner has won more Gramophone awards than any other artist. Probably the most francophile of English conductors, John Eliot Gardiner returned to the Opéra Comique, Paris for a much aclaimed production of Carmen last year. On June 25th it was broadcast live to 50 theatres in France and Switzerland and also recorded for TV. This followed an exciting collaboration that began in December 2007 with Chabrier s Opera bouffe L'Etoile, which had opened the new theatre at Opera Comique in December 2007.","popularity":0.2329,"poster_path":"/7TrfMcwEI0nefWE542tkMRDurCL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bizet: Carmen (Anna Caterina Antonacci/The Monteverdi Choir/John Eliot Gardiner)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1006157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Caterina Antonacci","original_name":"Anna Caterina Antonacci","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/7ZuOkR7zaLDSOKpZaxXBziTsK54.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Carmen","credit_id":"5e7b0fa48c44b900174d4f0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1576023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Richards","original_name":"Andrew Richards","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":"/wRlFuinJE0tdz3FCRRS4rsSpWrP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Don Jose","credit_id":"5e7b0fe263d71300108aeb54","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Cavallier","original_name":"Nicolas Cavallier","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Escamillo","credit_id":"5f1aed3ab344090034a0f21c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1881014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne-Catherine Gillet","original_name":"Anne-Catherine Gillet","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/unFIhpWVwr5HhRqAOPP6YHhuKHu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Micaëla","credit_id":"5f1aed60176a94003a070c94","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Roussillon","original_name":"François Roussillon","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f1aea4f691cd5003498db3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1338572,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Eliot Gardiner","original_name":"John Eliot Gardiner","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/pIHSar5WD1PlfynCuAn8PHuNvA2.jpg","credit_id":"5f1aeefc303c85003347c328","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19179144","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7TrfMcwEI0nefWE542tkMRDurCL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":768},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i6Dzwh9Iwk9lVRiVmSRzfIRa1g1.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"classiquenews.com","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
