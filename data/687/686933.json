The cross-media work 'Mother's Tongue' is a collaboration between artist Lap-See Lam and filmmaker Wingyee Wu. The film version is created with a spatial scanner that has produced the three-dimensional architectural animations which a weightless camera floats around in, while we in three short episodes listen to the personal stories about language, identity and life as a Chinese person in Sweden.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother’s Tongue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wingyee Wu","original_name":"Wingyee Wu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7dd2b4fea0d772afc9e733","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2580362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lap-See Lam","original_name":"Lap-See Lam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ye20BJdy72XTI5AHmPXe1O0DU9T.jpg","credit_id":"5e7dd2c26c849200146b702c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
