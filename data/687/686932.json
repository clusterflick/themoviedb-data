A group of people dressed in white robes perform a choreographed ritual, led by an androgynous figure dressed in black, who leads them through an American metropolis and on to a cemetery where they bury their weapons in a pacifist gesture, but do so with power, pride and a will to resist. As they part with their machines, the members of the enigmatic group create a monument to life and the living, at the same time as they establish a connection to the phantoms of the past.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Undertaker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1395150,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yael Bartana","original_name":"Yael Bartana","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7dd1826c74b94ca5cb5284","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
