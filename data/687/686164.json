He appeals to Fay, a wealthy relative, for help in marketing his invention and arouses the interest of Fay's pretty daughter. Sterrett, Fay's partner, steals the model but returns it when he discovers it to be worthless. Johnny Smith, Fay's secretary, is fired when he proposes to the boss's daughter; and visiting Vale's attic, he is comforted by his epigrams. Johnny takes them to a newspaper editor, and they are so successful that both Smith and Vale are hired. Vale decides to give up inventing for writing, and Johnny marries Miss Fay despite her father's opposition.","popularity":0.1367,"poster_path":"/3qEZMbPbc39JNZUzw1rpJmOdgPL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldwyn Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You will laugh and cry and be stirred to the very depths of your heart","title":"A Poor Relation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"金持の親類","type":"Japanese title"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Um Parente Pobre","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Rogers","original_name":"Will Rogers","popularity":0.1814,"profile_path":"/zzJ0FkSjISPUQ1QPskFaKwPJPr7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Noah Vale","credit_id":"5e7abc4063d71300128a767e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvia Breamer","original_name":"Sylvia Breamer","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":"/xOXMyffJQJ5JV14aFByvXL81LXU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Miss Fay","credit_id":"5e7abc49fea0d70016c7b3ee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace MacDonald","original_name":"Wallace MacDonald","popularity":0.357,"profile_path":"/lP3Lxz5EiWYhziMJedbkuzeaQeE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Johnny Smith","credit_id":"5e7abc52fea0d70014c7d003","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidney Ainsworth","original_name":"Sidney Ainsworth","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/cyshcbV54mF8BQF83bvAengWoku.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sterrett","credit_id":"5e7abc5a8c44b900154d012c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George B.
