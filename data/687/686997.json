'The Truth about Your Feet' is an associative examination of the changing masculinity in the 21st century and how it feels to adapt to these changes. Lange uses the form of a network to give structure to the associative connections that are made throughout the film instead of being constructed like a linear story from A to B.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Truth About Your Feet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2580615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeppe Lange","original_name":"Jeppe Lange","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7e16256c849200126bba2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
