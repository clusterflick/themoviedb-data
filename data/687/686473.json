The film was shot on the Pavilion’s upper landing, the camera positioned looking out through the curved windows of the stairwell across the exterior balcony to a view of the sea and the horizon. It comprises two alternating sequences projected onto either side of a free standing wall. Footage of elderly couples ballroom dancing on the balcony outside has been slowed down to the rhythm of the accompanying soundtrack, an extract from Franz Schubert’s Nocturne in E-flat Major (Op.148) overlaid by the sounds of breaking waves and seagulls. In the alternating scene, played to the same sound, panoramic vistas of the view out of the building towards the sea and horizon beyond are empty of human presence.","popularity":0.209,"poster_path":"/hMn93r3fw6Rr2OrINGQ0lEekkqb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other Side","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Breakwell","original_name":"Ian Breakwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7be89663d71379d189f65c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Breakwell","original_name":"Ian Breakwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7be8b6aafebd2bda9c29f7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Breakwell","original_name":"Ian Breakwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7be8c8eec4f355eaa82b12","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":764,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hMn93r3fw6Rr2OrINGQ0lEekkqb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":509},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":927,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1hkZImwJLuDq3X4f3DY2m43CEPm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":617}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263697,"name":"video installation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Video Installation.","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
