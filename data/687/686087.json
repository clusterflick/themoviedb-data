Three soldiers arrive at a solitary military garrison which no longer serves any defensive function. Here, time is at a standstill and is marked by strict regulations, power dynamics, engrained idleness and habit. Waiting in vain for an enemy that will not arrive, the military officers are consumed by the need to give their stay meaning, and resist the attraction that this place holds for them.","popularity":0.4449,"poster_path":"/u8Bzu5Ksmr0SdTrRU9gQ6YKsjMB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138625,"logo_path":null,"name":"Associazione Compagnia
