This film, shot with an old mobile phone, is an experimental biopic of Walser, a tribute to microgrammes, an ode to poor cinema and the minuscule poetry of things.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fc1DnAFpoVl004aGKAanhay6Q7E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poème des loups","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389849,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florian Maricourt","original_name":"Florian Maricourt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7af8a78c44b900174d2309","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":770,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fc1DnAFpoVl004aGKAanhay6Q7E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":513}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
