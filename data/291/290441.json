The Czar’s soldiers have been close on the heels of the leader of the rebellious Finns, who have been fighting the Russian occupiers since the end of the 18th Century.  His flight leads him to the chambers of the dancer Marina Feodorowna, in whose house a party is taking place at that very moment.  Marina discovers the intruder, hides him from his pursuers and soon falls in love with him.  But hiding Erkki forever is not an option; so she presents him as her music teacher.  The swindle fails and Prince Governor Abarow, who’s long had a thing for Marina, discovers the real identity of the man, but doesn’t have him arrested.","popularity":0.1979,"poster_path":"/y7IoIthSf828qTi24HSz2gl2KZI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12372,"logo_path":"/lcQScIQXHQXuLMLFQt0loJl5gWJ.png","name":"UFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1935-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Roses","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilian Harvey","original_name":"Lilian Harvey","popularity":0.1596,"profile_path":"/hkEO3LYFOgu7tGVQLzc5ZpbV0w1.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tania Fedorovna","credit_id":"5408637bc3a368582c000f77","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willy Fritsch","original_name":"Willy Fritsch","popularity":0.1709,"profile_path":"/7MKVQWgy8VncbRxF249WimBxfxm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Erkki Collin","credit_id":"5408638cc3a368581e00104e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willy Birgel","original_name":"Willy Birgel","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/kQJcGCLE4EDHCGhoVBeUieRbTYa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Fürst Abarow","credit_id":"5408639ec3a368582c000f7a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerhard Bienert","original_name":"Gerhard Bienert","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":"/iCFmDeSyZBMaVMZxCxC2cY8riRK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Niklander","credit_id":"540863b4c3a3685833001038","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolf Ackva","original_name":"Wolf Ackva","popularity":0.124,"profile_path":"/hmMWjGoq06ih9EL5oBPZw5Ejv2a.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5ad3563d92514173640264f1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1949289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Pohl","original_name":"Klaus Pohl","popularity":0.1423,"profile_path":"/7w1iGL6f1pnNBj2SUn6TbSwUQgu.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Polizeiagent","credit_id":"5ad3564fc3a3683f0002a7aa","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":161260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Martin","original_name":"Paul Martin","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5408632cc3a368581e001047","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0026968","wikidata_id":"Q17479173","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1012,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y7IoIthSf828qTi24HSz2gl2KZI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-12-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
