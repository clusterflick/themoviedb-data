The restless child finds a chance to create his own stories when his grandfather, comes up with a game. They fill an old milk can with pieces of paper, each containing a word which will be a “story-starter”. Tales of heroes and villains, magic and places fill up the child’s imagination.

Now, it depends on the storyteller mother to create the greatest ending of them all.","popularity":0.083,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":59710,"logo_path":null,"name":"Revolver Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":57664,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nestlé Philippines","origin_country":""},{"id":59711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Publicis Manila","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2011-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What's in a word?","title":"Sali-salita","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miggs Cuaderno","original_name":"Miggs Cuaderno","popularity":0.0793,"profile_path":"/zEsxmiyC0ev2XOXx5s9pR7bOJru.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Josh","credit_id":"54055dc40e0a264d83000fca","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Chua","original_name":"Judy Chua","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Helen","credit_id":"54055dcf0e0a2649e5001006","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bodjie Pascua","original_name":"Bodjie Pascua","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/4mEDoZLmhm1KxrCOfl9nDUQPrnC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lolo","credit_id":"55b9bba692514123d8003955","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carme Sanchez","original_name":"Carme Sanchez","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Aling Nelly","credit_id":"54055de50e0a2658f100bfb3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Aguilar","original_name":"Alvin Aguilar","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Warrior","credit_id":"54055dee0e0a2658de00c397","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359705,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"A.F.
