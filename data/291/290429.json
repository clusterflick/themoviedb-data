However, his mission is complicated by the fact that Helene, the ambassador's wife, is extremely jealous of every woman he meets, for she was responsible for getting him his appointment as attaché. Belmar, nevertheless, is in love with Greta, who will not marry him until he is proven worthy of her trust. After many narrow escapes from exposure of the personal intrigue, he manages to sway the attentions of Mona, who persuades the war minister to sign the treaty, thus gaining Belmar an appointment as ambassador to Peru and Greta as his wife.","popularity":0.1744,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1931-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boudoir Diplomat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Beehrt sich Vorzufaehren","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Riemann","original_name":"Johannes Riemann","popularity":0.2316,"profile_path":"/46LG5vuLB9TZ3ltgu0Oo6MtCUfI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marquis de Saint Lac","credit_id":"54085979c3a3685825000ff5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Tschechowa","original_name":"Olga Tschechowa","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/3ZltpEEbWAc9noJPioXRwB3h6Hc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Manuela","credit_id":"5408599fc3a3685818000ff3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Junkermann","original_name":"Hans Junkermann","popularity":0.1974,"profile_path":"/4prEypLmJGo74ofqsgHABBipUuj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Minister of War","credit_id":"5408d3600e0a263a1000055a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tala Birell","original_name":"Tala Birell","popularity":0.1563,"profile_path":"/8lFYYvOQnQ2KMGQ3SYXOw5VEKlp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marie-Anne","credit_id":"5408598ec3a368581b001022","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnold Korff","original_name":"Arnold Korff","popularity":0.134,"profile_path":"/droYE1mJ1xgfIDvnYYnbHUEw614.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Messenger","credit_id":"5408d3990e0a263a07000535","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Conti","original_name":"Albert Conti","popularity":0.1562,"profile_path":"/sBvjKclAZPsCrPFyGzOawWMQjJG.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Emile","credit_id":"5408d3ae0e0a263a0d000538","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Weigel","original_name":"Paul Weigel","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/9NTRs4Hkg1HbEXd2zHINobcfwH8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Munaterra","credit_id":"5408d3bb0e0a263a1e0004f7","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Riemann","original_name":"Johannes Riemann","popularity":0.2316,"profile_path":"/46LG5vuLB9TZ3ltgu0Oo6MtCUfI.jpg","credit_id":"54085969c3a368582c000e7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Werner Klingler","original_name":"Werner Klingler","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/529tagupvMybLZxGmVuRh8uKW5.jpg","credit_id":"5408d3ed0e0a263a0d00053d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1360671,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dr. Ernst E.
