But Marsan accidentally kills Ciming. As team leader, Rainang is willing to take responsibility (punishment by exile) while Marsan is appointed as the new village leader and Rausin (Rainangâ€™s son) is sent to the Islamic boarding school. When Rausin returns to Kemayoran, the village leader, Marsan, is now a corrupt man. The Dutch reprimand him as the villagers no longer want to sell rice to them. The village leader then assigns Beureum, an assassin, to get rid of Rausin. But Toha and Cicih, the female warrior, support him. Rainang, who is thought to have passed away, appears and intervenes, and in the end, kills Marsan.","popularity":0.1294,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":106723,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Aries Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1965-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tiger of Kemayoran","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdul Hamid Arief","original_name":"Abdul Hamid Arief","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":"/hClLCWE6hJLSgdioL3lOXoNSfqX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"540adb240e0a262b4900213a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1155197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"R.D.
