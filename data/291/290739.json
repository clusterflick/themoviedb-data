With lax labour and environmental regulations, some of the developers take full advantage of the situation, and the local fishermen start accusing them of exploitation and land thievery. Unexpectedly, in the midst of this conflict, firebrand Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas sweep back into government, boldly empowering the local fishermen. The tables turn viciously on the American developers, who get much more than they bargained for. But when the local fishermen, corrupted by new found power, begin acting in the same manner as the American developers, questions are posed about human nature, morality, and ethics on a much larger scale.","popularity":0.3095,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32291,"logo_path":null,"name":"Six Island Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":26442,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deliberate Films","origin_country":""},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Berry","original_name":"Chris Berry","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"540a44fb0e0a262b3a000de2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Campesino","original_name":"Daniel Campesino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"540a45080e0a262b4c000d95","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian T.
