It takes the young man two acts to figure out that sleepwalking is to blame, and everything ends happily. Natalie Dessay as Amina and Juan Diego Flórez as Elvino deliver bel canto magic and vocal fireworks in Mary Zimmerman’s 2009 production. The Tony award-winning director transfers Bellini’s bucolic tale to a rehearsal room in contemporary New York, where an opera company rehearses La Sonnambula—and where the singers are truly in love with each other.","popularity":0.4989,"poster_path":"/AfI3WL7HdVNEogSiNySCfsDfAJN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Sonnambula","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":550023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Dessay","original_name":"Natalie Dessay","popularity":0.2413,"profile_path":"/wppFso5aGmto3Pj5cOU42Z1x2PF.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Amina","credit_id":"540bab6a0e0a262b40003294","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":268115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Diego Flórez","original_name":"Juan Diego Flórez","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/5C27Cvb0Pvv1Nm8bmKy4T8SWzWI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Elvino","credit_id":"540bab770e0a262b4900327f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Pertusi","original_name":"Michele Pertusi","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/fJx3QXGTMQ6Z0sCAQIvFIsyNLlE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Count Rodolfo","credit_id":"540bab830e0a263640000744","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1361527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Black","original_name":"Jennifer Black","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/t5vnOuwTRTUXNuVkiMuEhaCwLSH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lisa","credit_id":"540baba90e0a262b49003285","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Galyon","original_name":"Jeremy Galyon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/jNqn6DzMXvxECePRzmdHKgYmFn0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alessio","credit_id":"540babb40e0a262b4900328b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1037381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Bunnell","original_name":"Jane Bunnell","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/5cducAkHERn636sDzg0RcSIDFwK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Teresa","credit_id":"540babc30e0a262b430033a3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1030419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Fitch","original_name":"Bernard Fitch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/8OMMCQuTQlJRJwZE1xqipsO8JNM.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Notary","credit_id":"540babd00e0a262b3d0032ab","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":266422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Voigt","original_name":"Deborah Voigt","popularity":0.1241,"profile_path":"/oofK3iDXS6FDclhHK8mDWwTWFC5.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Self -
