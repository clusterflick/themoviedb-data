The outdoor setting is stunning–it is a massive Roman quarry with mountains visible in the near and far distance–and apparently this Traviata is the first opera they’ve done without wild animals in residence (Nabucco, Aida, and Carmen have been shown in recent years). The sets are lavish enough to make Franco Zeffirelli blush. Designer Manfred Waba has placed the action in a reproduction of the Paris Opera, complete with stage boxes inhabited by patrons in their fanciest clothing who watch along with us. There is more gold than anyone would know what to do with.","popularity":0.1112,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2008-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"St Margarethen Festival, 2008","title":"La Traviata","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"La Traviata at the St Margarethen Festival","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristiane Kaiser","original_name":"Kristiane Kaiser","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Violetta Valéry","credit_id":"540634f8c3a368437200894e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magdalena Anna Hofmann","original_name":"Magdalena Anna Hofmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Flora Bervoix","credit_id":"54063517c3a3684372008954","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefanie Kopinits","original_name":"Stefanie Kopinits","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Annina","credit_id":"54063524c3a36816af003eb2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-François Borras","original_name":"Jean-François Borras","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Alfredo Germont","credit_id":"5406353dc3a3682d98007415","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Tichy","original_name":"Georg Tichy","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Giorgio Germont","credit_id":"5406354dc3a3682d9800741d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Herzl","original_name":"Robert Herzl","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5406356ec3a3684363008981","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giuseppe Verdi","original_name":"Giuseppe Verdi","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/3W2HAqexkcpK6mWG3vseRlhD1ep.jpg","credit_id":"5697e0f5c3a3687608000337","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140807,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Francesco Maria Piave","original_name":"Francesco Maria Piave","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5697e1089251412543000370","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148077,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandre Dumas fils","original_name":"Alexandre Dumas fils","popularity":0.1055,"profile_path":"/ipR2EbPl6cuPmCONW8MA8zsTbhC.jpg","credit_id":"5697e115925141253a000394","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2593118","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
