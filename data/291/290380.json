Initially attracted to painting, David Lynch ends up choosing the medium of film to express his talent.  Far from being an attempt at biography, this film is an imaginary vision where the action could take place today. Which encounters or events leave their mark on the young David L. during this year as a student?  “The Dreamlife of David L.” is a dreamlike journey that leads the viewer through the meanderings of this art school. There’s no need to be familiar with the cinematographic works of Lynch to follow the young David L. step by step, going behind the scenes with him.","popularity":0.8371,"poster_path":"/hgG3uW6kJnqb1VB9AVcH52GekI8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51822,"logo_path":null,"name":"TransKom","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The
