This year Santa Claus asks Santabear to deliver his toys to the South Pole, so that the children there will also believe in the magic of Christmas. But when the naughty Bullybear steals Santabear's bag of toys and his identity, all chances for a merry Christmas seem lost. Luckily, Santabear meets Missy Bear, and together they take to the skies to stop Bullybear before he destroys all the toys and ruins Christmas at the South Pole
