One day, Woronzeff decides that this similarity might come in handy.  Since he is very ill and can no longer deal with the intrigues of his relatives, he begs his friend Naydek to play the role of prince for a while.  Naydek agrees and everything seems to be going splendidly.  Woronzeff’s ex-nag Diane sees through the game, however, but says nothing, since she’s fallen for Naydek.  He, in turn, has the hots for Nadja, Woronzeff’s daughter, long thought lost and who has now reappeared.  The prince’s relatives fear for their inheritance and so refuse to acknowledge Nadja’s existence.  In the interim, Woronzeff dies.  Now Naydek is obliged to play the role for a much longer time than he bargained for.","popularity":0.3496,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12372,"logo_path":"/lcQScIQXHQXuLMLFQt0loJl5gWJ.png","name":"UFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1934-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prince
