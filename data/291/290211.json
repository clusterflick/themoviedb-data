Stefan ends up saving the life of young Christine and becomes her fiancée.  Christine, however, is Nora’s daughter  (can’t see where this is heading, huh?).  When Christine finds out that mom and her hubby-to-be had a rather intimate history, she takes a boat ride on a stormy lake.  But the prophecy of disaster associated with the bronze figure “Melusine” does not come to pass:  Stefan looks for Christine, finds her in one piece and stays with her.  Nora, for her part, decides incest might be a bad thing and gives up Stefan forever to go back to the man she divorced (hey, way to feel wanted!).  For some reason, the Nazis didn’t like the plot’s moral message and banned it after its completion.","popularity":0.2294,"poster_path":"/m0c70kQkqGcZvbSm3huyT3VKQcL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terra-Filmkunst","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1944-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melusine","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die schöne Melusine","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Tschechowa","original_name":"Olga Tschechowa","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/3ZltpEEbWAc9noJPioXRwB3h6Hc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nora","credit_id":"540649eac3a3684366008dc0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siegfried Breuer","original_name":"Siegfried Breuer","popularity":0.0878,"profile_path":"/rXhySWLa7Sj1Q9yy6pe9lFqKyce.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Stefan Brock","credit_id":"540649fcc3a36816af003fe2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1181392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelika Hauff","original_name":"Angelika Hauff","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/p148VE6gKuZggavrmFFrW9tTDyd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Christine von Hardegg","credit_id":"54064a15c3a36816af003fe4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Friedrich Domin","original_name":"Friedrich Domin","popularity":0.1896,"profile_path":"/lQ6sryMwKQ4ZVkRnHkxU7UeF7wa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Professor von Hardegg","credit_id":"5ad14925925141736c002f1e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1949289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Pohl","original_name":"Klaus Pohl","popularity":0.1423,"profile_path":"/7w1iGL6f1pnNBj2SUn6TbSwUQgu.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5ad149340e0a266c31003264","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49221,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Steinhoff","original_name":"Hans Steinhoff","popularity":0.2867,"profile_path":"/xvP4DLKf3DE4on6tA63iNdeRt47.jpg","credit_id":"540649c0c3a3684366008dbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":51156,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Werner Eplinius","original_name":"Werner Eplinius","popularity":0.1289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5916ba30c3a3683fb602abac","department":"Writing","job":"Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46189,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Jary","original_name":"Michael Jary","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5916ba43c3a368426902f49c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0037065","wikidata_id":"Q21035753","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m0c70kQkqGcZvbSm3huyT3VKQcL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1944-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
