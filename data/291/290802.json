Making use of British, Soviet and American footage, the Ministry of Information’s Sidney Bernstein (later founder of Granada Television) aimed to create a documentary that would provide lasting, undeniable evidence of the Nazis’ unspeakable crimes. He commissioned a wealth of British talent, including editor Stewart McAllister, writer and future cabinet minister Richard Crossman – and, as treatment advisor, his friend Alfred Hitchcock. Yet, despite initial support from the British and US Governments, the film was shelved, and only now, 70 years on, has it been restored and completed by Imperial War Museums under its original title \"German Concentration Camps Factual Survey\".","popularity":2.7825,"poster_path":"/lEsfJbN5BBw1wlqCvzxuBLGwitt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9120,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spring Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":29062,"logo_path":"/hwlA6f2HhaOJP1ZcrYL8f8g8UbJ.png","name":"Final Cut for Real","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Will Fall","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":84,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Hitchcoks Lehrfilm für die Deutschen","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Images de la libération des camps.
