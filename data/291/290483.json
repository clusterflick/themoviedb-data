Von Halleborg becomes a broken man and chooses not to waste another moment thinking of love -- his heart belongs to Julia ... forever.  In doing so, von Halleborg runs the risk of losing his entire estate, for the conditions of inheritance make all to clear that if he does not marry by his 45th birthday, the estate is to be turned over to someone else.  Von Halleborg had already made peace with this fact until he discovers that the future lord of the manor will be his nephew Oskar, a selfish and ruthless scoundrel, concerned only with money.","popularity":0.2271,"poster_path":"/muSpPvBgc6XdiQ89lxRfle5oRae.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12372,"logo_path":"/lcQScIQXHQXuLMLFQt0loJl5gWJ.png","name":"UFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1943-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Heir","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willy Birgel","original_name":"Willy Birgel","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/kQJcGCLE4EDHCGhoVBeUieRbTYa.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bernhard von Halleborg","credit_id":"5408c928c3a36812ba000318","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":50615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktoria von Ballasko","original_name":"Viktoria von Ballasko","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":"/uvCKp1GQwU9oBlPJ6mnsssgZXBU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Amelie von Linden","credit_id":"5408c969c3a36812c300034c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1093688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anneliese Uhlig","original_name":"Anneliese Uhlig","popularity":0.1055,"profile_path":"/n6ZWOypL3Q1GwI0p9QGjNB4hHOg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Julia Dahl","credit_id":"5408c97ac3a36812c300034e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Liedtke","original_name":"Harry Liedtke","popularity":0.331,"profile_path":"/6uub4Y8JGTi2MmzbFVq5DD2Yf5o.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Stempel","credit_id":"5a1c1f1ac3a3680b9a058be9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hedwig Wangel","original_name":"Hedwig Wangel","popularity":0.1263,"profile_path":"/1EZnugp9eMpNVn2YiALJP2D06Y2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Malena","credit_id":"5a1c1f2992514103390548a5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1351758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Meissner","original_name":"Maria Meissner","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a1c1f39c3a3680b93055201","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1549152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Sattler","original_name":"Ernst Sattler","popularity":0.0587,"profile_path":"/1Emi6c2Qcy1qgW84fyirkWiPeVZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"von Linden","credit_id":"5c707d83c3a3685a441113d9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1457751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heddo Schulenburg","original_name":"Heddo Schulenburg","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Kurt","credit_id":"5c707d9e9251415ee8af0909","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1340421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Scharf","original_name":"Werner Scharf","popularity":0.1505,"profile_path":"/jji54bv3PjW0P8RT1SzabXlZpF2.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Oskar von Halleborg","credit_id":"5c7fe333925141276018cb39","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Deppe","original_name":"Hans Deppe","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":"/4izzHQgMQFCfxmaf8QSOOsHvWB0.jpg","credit_id":"5408c8ffc3a36812b700032c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0037041","wikidata_id":"Q92745328","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/muSpPvBgc6XdiQ89lxRfle5oRae.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1943-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
