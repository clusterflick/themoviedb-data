Feeling trapped by life in her low-income community, and unable to relate to her brother Patrick, a petty criminal, or her overly pious mother, Mary, Cassandra decides to leave Toronto. She applies and is accepted into an exchange program between Quebec and West Africa. When she reaches her Quebec destination, a pig farm, she encounters, Sylvie Leblanc, a woman in need of change, her husband, Luc Leblanc, a man afraid of change and Abdoulaye Diallo, her African exchange counter-part, a man who regrets his decision to seek change. Because none of her expectations are met, Cassandra quickly becomes unhappy on the farm. Her presence creates plenty of tension, much of it humorous. A surprising conclusion comes about after a roller-coaster series of events.","popularity":0.542,"poster_path":"/fd3RrY98liHlSri3znssz9ca3Ts.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151272,"logo_path":null,"name":"Syncopated Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"All she wanted was another life.","title":"Another Planet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1319919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandy Daley","original_name":"Sandy Daley","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Cassandra Jones","credit_id":"574ae16c9251412d29000d4d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1627909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Lévesque","original_name":"Daniel Lévesque","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/arbcIzwcKsHT7gQbEuwcVUDymFI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Luc Leblanc","credit_id":"574ae15b925141362d000d93","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2297645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monique MacDonald","original_name":"Monique MacDonald","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sylvie LeBlanc","credit_id":"5cc37bdd0e0a264d93eebfe3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3185343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcia Brown","original_name":"Marcia Brown","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mary Jones","credit_id":"654aa84a532acb00fe3625a1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4362927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiemoko Simaga","original_name":"Tiemoko Simaga","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Abdoulaye Diallo","credit_id":"654aa86e67b61300e5dc183e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4362930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathieu Dutan","original_name":"Mathieu Dutan","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Jean Leblanc","credit_id":"654aa88641a561336d860fdd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4362932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Panchetta S.
