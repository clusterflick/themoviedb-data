The devoted, if not masochistic Magic Assistant who distorts her body into impossible positions while the magician cuts her in pieces, stabs her, sets her on fire, crushes her, makes her disappear, then restores her to life with a dramatic \"Taa Daa!\" and takes a bow to wild applause. Who is the woman who would subject herself to such torture, not to mention, the Magician's Ego? Are these women just bimbos parading around in skimpy clothes? Or are they the real magic behind the Illusionist? Heretofore sworn to secrecy, this tough yet feminine group opened their homes, hearts and lives for the filmmakers and gave an insider's view of love, life and magic family values.","popularity":0.0889,"poster_path":"/z8fYxzWTSYEE4u9LqqRSdert7Ke.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Behind every great magician, is a woman, in a box.","title":"Women in Boxes","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1360040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Noyes","original_name":"Phil Noyes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5406b581c3a368690900034f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1360041,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Pallenberg","original_name":"Harry Pallenberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5406b590c3a36868f6000327","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1268991","wikidata_id":"Q128789926","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/z8fYxzWTSYEE4u9LqqRSdert7Ke.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":680},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w631qiqiouU4u6vFN0D2c6s3Mi2.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
