But there were a couple of twists that made it seem more personal than the usual cowboy fare. Ford's Jack Dayton ... is known as \"the No-Gun Man\" because he faces the villains unarmed, anticipating the character played by James Stewart in George Marshall's 1939 Western comedy classic Destry Rides Again. Dayton is an immigrant who uses the reward money to bring over his mother (Jean Hathaway) from Ireland, a prototypically Fordian situation if there ever was one.","popularity":0.285,"poster_path":"/xM8AswQs61Tbhu2EEYlq10YIyGn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52438,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bison Motion Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tornado","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Ford","original_name":"John Ford","popularity":0.8044,"profile_path":"/ffgVJWV8pDomSdTkjOqdrwMX9G6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jack Dayton (as Jack Ford)","credit_id":"540af81e0e0a262b49002417","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1351460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Hathaway","original_name":"Jean Hathaway","popularity":0.1717,"profile_path":"/j29BbLYT3ELdpMjoXGTo7i9AI46.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jack's mother","credit_id":"540af8270e0a262b43002461","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Gerald","original_name":"Peter Gerald","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Pendleton - banker from Rock River (as Pete Gerald)","credit_id":"540af8340e0a262b4600244e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1796201,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsie Thornton","original_name":"Elsie Thornton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bess - Jack's daughter","credit_id":"58f12cfe92514155420036ba","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1355998,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duke Worne","original_name":"Duke Worne","popularity":0.196,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Lesparre - the lead of Cayote gang","credit_id":"58f12d08925141553c0039ea","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1754697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Duffy","original_name":"John Duffy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Slick - Jack's partner","credit_id":"58f12d1f92514155420036d2","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Ford","original_name":"John Ford","popularity":0.8044,"profile_path":"/ffgVJWV8pDomSdTkjOqdrwMX9G6.jpg","credit_id":"540af7f90e0a262b46002440","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":981642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Cunard","original_name":"Grace Cunard","popularity":0.3076,"profile_path":"/o1Dc87jVxUVdpFjezs0TjEZeURv.jpg","credit_id":"58f12ccec3a3681a520037f3","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Ford","original_name":"Francis Ford","popularity":0.5663,"profile_path":"/v5MKJZbr5kwP7KbLjNgw7Bqwsto.jpg","credit_id":"58f12cd7c3a3681a6c003484","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Ford","original_name":"John Ford","popularity":0.8044,"profile_path":"/ffgVJWV8pDomSdTkjOqdrwMX9G6.jpg","credit_id":"58f12cdf925141551f003814","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0008690","wikidata_id":"Q2256657","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xM8AswQs61Tbhu2EEYlq10YIyGn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1917-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
