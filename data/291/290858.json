This documentary feature explores and contrasts changes in Poland and South Africa regarding abortion laws and their impact on the lives of women.  In the 90's, Poland banned abortion due to the increasing influence of the Catholic Church after the fall of communism; around the same time South Africa legalized it, reforming the health system after the fall of apartheid.  The film reveals how the legal status of women is a direct result of the silencing or empowering of women's voices. In the Polish society and media, women's perspectives were made invisible; in South Africa, on the other hand, they were invited to give public hearings in the parliament about problems in the realm of reproduction.","popularity":0.2552,"poster_path":"/uiup8FUdAvHTOAIcrIoXd8wMYDQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abortion Democracy: Poland/South Africa","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2588164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wanda Nowicka","original_name":"Wanda Nowicka","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Organiser","credit_id":"5e874a48da10f00018a261fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2588165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alicja Tysiac","original_name":"Alicja Tysiac","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Activist","credit_id":"5e874a523f7e1d001a5e77e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2588166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marijke Alblas","original_name":"Marijke Alblas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Abortion provider","credit_id":"5e874a5d3f7e1d00175e6717","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2588167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nurrudin Farrah","original_name":"Nurrudin Farrah","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Author","credit_id":"5e874a6566e4690014a7b6dc","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Diehl","original_name":"Sarah Diehl","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540b0a9b0e0a262b46002596","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361294,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sarah Diehl","original_name":"Sarah Diehl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540b0aad0e0a262b490025b1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1352651","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uiup8FUdAvHTOAIcrIoXd8wMYDQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3644,"name":"south africa"},{"id":21747,"name":"poland"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
