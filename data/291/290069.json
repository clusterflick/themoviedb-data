He is determined to win despite his obvious “f” and “p” speech defect, a proclivity common amongst some Filipinos to interchange the pronunciation of English words with the letters “f” and “p”. His mother takes an active albeit humorous role in preparing him for the competition. This is a story of perseverance, family unity and the real meaning of triumph and possibly the “Rocky” of all declamation contests!","popularity":0.1423,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":57664,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nestlé Philippines","origin_country":""},{"id":61549,"logo_path":null,"name":"Straightshooters Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2011-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Can a boy who fronounces \"p\" as \"f\" win a declamation comfetition and his pamily's suffort?","title":"The Howl & The Fussyket","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Domingo","original_name":"Eugene Domingo","popularity":0.5709,"profile_path":"/uYMbQAkuswthnm1Xihvg9zrhpvc.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Ana Lumibao","credit_id":"5405168e0e0a2658db00b5af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1139665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiray Celis","original_name":"Kiray Celis","popularity":0.2674,"profile_path":"/3EFb58hgW4HgkzXB1Oo2VX8hYIG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Alexi Lumibao","credit_id":"540516990e0a2658ee00b3e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Padilla","original_name":"Dennis Padilla","popularity":2.788,"profile_path":"/yf8DUZDcAI04Pl3mJAZJhViTWdo.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mr. Lumibao","credit_id":"540516a50e0a264d83000482","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1139666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerald Pesigan","original_name":"Gerald Pesigan","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Aaron Lumibao","credit_id":"540516c50e0a264d8300048d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tess Antonio","original_name":"Tess Antonio","popularity":0.0793,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Chelsea","credit_id":"55d9867092514143f30041c8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1495529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Pasturan","original_name":"Chris Pasturan","popularity":0.0855,"profile_path":"/7LpJZO5JGbYIz2rIMXEvZEoON8M.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Chester","credit_id":"55d98683925141721d003073","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1147232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ermie Concepcion","original_name":"Ermie Concepcion","popularity":0.1209,"profile_path":"/gaEPt3aDbSwzdZDrkXxHVpRotaI.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Aling Melody","credit_id":"55d98697c3a3683207004162","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1499620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bea Verdel de Dios","original_name":"Bea Verdel de Dios","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Aaron's Friend","credit_id":"55d986acc3a36831f6004330","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1499621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Dala","original_name":"Carlos Dala","popularity":0.1199,"profile_path":"/iseQweHyhlcgtb3TvBrh5bwnB5L.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Aaron's Friend","credit_id":"55d986bb92514143e4004514","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Chan","original_name":"Timothy Chan","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/tnxx03o1EIG2bTW6uh5MAssYLrW.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mateo","credit_id":"55d986d3c3a368320b004822","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":227371,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Martinez","original_name":"Chris Martinez","popularity":0.1236,"profile_path":"/zdcXRiBoD82Hub5QFWGXfybUlef.jpg","credit_id":"540516e70e0a2658d800b248","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":227371,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris Martinez","original_name":"Chris Martinez","popularity":0.1236,"profile_path":"/zdcXRiBoD82Hub5QFWGXfybUlef.jpg","credit_id":"540516df0e0a264b090004af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1989670","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6895,"name":"philippines"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
