In the previous century, the Dutch closed off and drained their inland sea to reclaim new farmland. The island of Urk, situated in the middle of the sea, suddenly found itself embraced by land.

They found new fishing grounds, far out in the North Sea.","popularity":0.0605,"poster_path":"/vfuf0VnjuJTM2J65ID0boLNwehy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2014-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Episode of the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Siebren de Haan","original_name":"Siebren de Haan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5407e0b50e0a26268b0007c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1220877,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lonnie van Brummelen","original_name":"Lonnie van Brummelen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5407e0c00e0a26385e0005ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1220877,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lonnie van Brummelen","original_name":"Lonnie van Brummelen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf16e07c3a36818ae05b1f6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Siebren de Haan","original_name":"Siebren de Haan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf16df10e0a26265c062947","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1220877,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lonnie van Brummelen","original_name":"Lonnie van Brummelen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf16e139251415cd105d38f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Siebren de Haan","original_name":"Siebren de Haan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf16de30e0a26265e062dc2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Siebren de Haan","original_name":"Siebren de Haan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf16df89251415cc805b4c1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1220877,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lonnie van Brummelen","original_name":"Lonnie van Brummelen","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf16dd99251415cd90595b2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3973638","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vfuf0VnjuJTM2J65ID0boLNwehy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
