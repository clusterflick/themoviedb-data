The Met orchestra, chorus, and an all-star cast make this Götterdämmerung one that truly rises to the occasion. Hildegard Behrens’s Brünnhilde must be experienced to be believed, as does Matti Salminen’s richly sung, domineering Hagen. At the center of the drama is Siegfried Jerusalem as Siegfried, who does not realize he has been drawn into a plot of betrayal until it is too late. Christa Ludwig is magnetic as Waltraute and Ekkehard Wlaschiha is a compelling Alberich.","popularity":0.3445,"poster_path":"/A4qmBpN4szs0Rw7t9S5LOnUIVHP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":281,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Götterdämmerung","video":true,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1116821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hildegard Behrens","original_name":"Hildegard Behrens","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/f5CEcs4Io43A8cPgzr3imxvWWRD.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Brünnhilde","credit_id":"57e4256ac3a368759c007c1e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siegfried Jerusalem","original_name":"Siegfried Jerusalem","popularity":0.1909,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Siegfried","credit_id":"57e42ad2c3a3682cb3004521","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matti Salminen","original_name":"Matti Salminen","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/85f1AMUU64wTADtLjQN4xLkM8cG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hagen","credit_id":"57e42ae4925141123c0070fa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":929017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christa Ludwig","original_name":"Christa Ludwig","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":"/wGh2rAEQVelko9bN4d0qVkfFUgb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Waltraute","credit_id":"57e42af89251411d610048af","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Raffell","original_name":"Anthony Raffell","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Gunther","credit_id":"57e42b11925141123a007071","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanna Liskowska","original_name":"Hanna Liskowska","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Gutrune","credit_id":"57e42b2ac3a368759c007f97","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ekkehard Wlaschiha","original_name":"Ekkehard Wlaschiha","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Alberich","credit_id":"57e42b3ec3a36875a10077bb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1681192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gweneth Bean","original_name":"Gweneth Bean","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"1.
