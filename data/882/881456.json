The girl was taken to an Azeri woman Fatima Khala, in a goal to be exchanged with her lost son. During this time the fear and the revulsion changed to a mutual charity and the result of this is that Fatima sends Lena back to her family after 4 months, exchanging her with a body of an Azeri soldier unknown to her. In Lena's memories, Fatima is still waiting for her son.","popularity":0.065,"poster_path":"/1KnkMkwfMbFngzeXLY380jGcMBI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broken
