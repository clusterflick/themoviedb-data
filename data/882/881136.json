The destruction of the Thunderbolt, one of the last remaining Coney Island icons, represented the end of an era in the amusement area's ever-evolving history. The film celebrates the Thunderbolt coaster as a piece of architecture that holds memories through which we gain insight into the history of New York and its people. Mae's story is a window onto a lost world and makes us think about the importance of place in a new way.","popularity":0.0645,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":126139,"logo_path":null,"name":"Department of Communication, Stanford University","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Roller Coaster","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3258755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Timpano","original_name":"Mae Timpano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"615b3167b1f68d004448df36","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997618,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lila Place","original_name":"Lila Place","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b3173172d7f009351e51e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3258758,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gordon Gurley","original_name":"Gordon Gurley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b31fddcb6a3004356ab63","department":"Editing","job":"Other"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1517242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leah Wolchok","original_name":"Leah Wolchok","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/9m0hH9AjHWaJL1iLslek85EzFBD.jpg","credit_id":"615b319c6ee3d70060a7c0b6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3258756,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paolo Puliga","original_name":"Paolo Puliga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b31a6d144430043605c35","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2604513,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mark Urbanek","original_name":"Mark Urbanek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b31c9eb14fa002a7674bf","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Advisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3258757,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Brian Leon","original_name":"Brian Leon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b31dddbf144006364b883","department":"Crew","job":"Telecine Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997618,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lila Place","original_name":"Lila Place","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b3180bb10570061109f98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2658104,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mike Seely","original_name":"Mike Seely","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b3195c8a2d40043c1f000","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997618,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lila Place","original_name":"Lila Place","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b3186b1f68d0027543195","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666002,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Olmsted","original_name":"Dan Olmsted","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b31e5c8a2d400623152ba","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4611270","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
