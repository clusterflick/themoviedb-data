Azul was the first publication of modern poetry in the Spanish language. Legiarda-Laura has given the same title to his film, because he wanted to show the Nicaraguan poetic inheritance. 24 poems are read, interspersed with interviews and discussions. Thus, the cultural soul of Nicaragua is mapped out.","popularity":0.078,"poster_path":"/pxORVkx6ZYn2Sct0Q7EcqzQ58fK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162028,"logo_path":null,"name":"Azul Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In Nicaragua you are either the son of a poet or the son of a bitch.","title":"Azul","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3258814,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland Legiardi-Laura","original_name":"Roland Legiardi-Laura","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b4e72b1f68d0027547b8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3258817,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Emilio Rodriguez","original_name":"Emilio Rodriguez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b4e9dac617c006355499a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3258818,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Joanna Kiernan","original_name":"Joanna Kiernan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b4eacdbf144008c5aade4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3258816,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mark Daniels","original_name":"Mark Daniels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615b4e92d556970043d0b4f3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1796918,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"J.T.
