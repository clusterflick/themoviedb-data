Diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophy at the age of 10, he is in a constant state of reinventing how he approaches each creative endeavor. When it comes to music, his current process involves the tediously clicking in notes on his computer, a guitar suspended from the ceiling, and help from friends and family.
