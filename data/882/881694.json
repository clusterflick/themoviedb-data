Spanning 500 years of colonial destruction, human trafficking and blood sucking, the film reimagines Oba’s origin story. In the late 15th century, Oba is shipped as cargo from West Africa to the Caribbean, where he is seduced by the vampire Christopher Columbus, ensuring his undying allegiance to the colonial project.  As the centuries blow by, Oba and Columbus work behind the scenes, pulling the strings of ‘new world’ geopolitics as they spread vampirism across the Western Hemisphere. Combining film forms and genre tropes, Nosferasta examines the guilt of being complicit in imperial conquest, while acknowledging the extreme difficulty of unlearning centuries of vampiric conditioning. Ultimately, the film tackles an uncomfortable question: How can you decolonise yourself, if it’s in your blood?","popularity":0.0672,"poster_path":"/kblfA3E9HIBoeQpXkpK2kiSi0sI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How can you decolonise yourself, if it’s in your blood?","title":"Nosferasta: First Bite","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3260664,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oba","original_name":"Oba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"615dae5833ec2600919627dc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1708457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Khalil","original_name":"Adam Khalil","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615dae16db952d002cb97df0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1673746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bayley Sweitzer","original_name":"Bayley Sweitzer","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615dae2b6beaea0042a255cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3260664,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oba","original_name":"Oba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615dae4a6beaea00638ed5d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt17825038","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":2714,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kblfA3E9HIBoeQpXkpK2kiSi0sI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
