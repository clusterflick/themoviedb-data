Using a set of elementary instructions such as modulation, masking, and feedback, Telcosystems programmed a self-organizing network of algorithmic processes for the creation of spatial image and sound. The result is a non-referential world which strains the senses; an exploration along the borders of human perception, through worlds of multiplying and mushrooming clouds of light and sound, through worlds of mesmerizing spatiality and interferring landscapes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/iIuRATM2BLQFog34ZjnKohZZ0BH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loudthings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1953968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Telcosystems","original_name":"Telcosystems","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615e01a4245dbe0042ededbe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":983,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iIuRATM2BLQFog34ZjnKohZZ0BH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":656}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
