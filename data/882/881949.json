Communists and Komsomol members are trying to persuade Fedor to forget about the church, but in vain. Daughter Anna laughs in the face of her father - and in vain too. But when the plant desperately needed a scarce metal, Shtukov, painfully thinking about his native plant, supported the proposal of one of the workers to cast the billet from the church bell, and the vessel was ready for launch on time.","popularity":0.3695,"poster_path":"/kS6xNYHJi9AlNfwUravgHtqkLK6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10845,"logo_path":"/8qh5BEyKYOQ0e81LPbvWHQvyOy5.png","name":"Lenfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet
