Its core element is a video loop of a spiritual site in Southern India called 1000 steps. Over and under this I have keyed in video synthesis and feedback. It is mostly one continuous clip, with little editing and no after-effects applied. I mean it to be as performative as possible, because working live, in an expanded cinema format is my goal.\r The sound is a collage of field recordings that came from several sights in India, and includes sounds of my friends the cicadas, and groups of kids demonstrating to save the local forests.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jfRnGhKYQO5ztfFs8Ea2jOPWwig.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ten Thousand Steps","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2743310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kit Young","original_name":"Kit Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615cd6e836390900638d2720","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1034,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jfRnGhKYQO5ztfFs8Ea2jOPWwig.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":689}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
