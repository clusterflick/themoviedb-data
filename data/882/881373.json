Born in 1949, the founding year of the People’s Republic of China, and raised during the Cultural Revolution, it seemed as if he would have to abandon his dream of a career in music. However, his talent, perseverance and the support of Herbert von Karajan ultimately brought him to the world’s concert halls.  Today, Muhai Tang is a global nomad. A wanderer between the worlds which he unites with music. His personal history, interspersed with historical caesurae, is typical for Chinese of his generation. He gained access to western culture early on through music. Muhai Tang’s life and work are exemplary of a changing China and the enrichment of the world by an artist between East and West.","popularity":0.2121,"poster_path":"/pdobH3o7sKDHaxW0HmowXlobFJU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160521,"logo_path":"/4MEFxcWzBU6BWJYZf0AmW8AdkJ2.png","name":"TILT Production","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2011-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In a globalized world, cultural interest in others is the key to understanding the foreign. - Muhai Tang","title":"Muhai Tang - In The Ocean Of Music","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1548488,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Muhai Tang","original_name":"Muhai Tang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"615c4174b1f68d009254dd42","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2666979,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kaspar Winkler","original_name":"Kaspar Winkler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615c4193eb14fa002a786057","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3259564,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Hertig","original_name":"Michael Hertig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615c41f50bc529004366d3e0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3259557,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Markus Unterfinger","original_name":"Markus Unterfinger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615c4182dbf144008c5c5174","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3259557,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Markus Unterfinger","original_name":"Markus Unterfinger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615c418aeb14fa002a786054","department":"Writing","job":"Author"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3259559,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Angelo Scuduletti","original_name":"Angelo Scuduletti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615c41cfeb14fa002a7860bf","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3259566,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rosmarie Schaub","original_name":"Rosmarie Schaub","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615c41fdb1f68d006768755c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1409456,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Simon Guy Fässler","original_name":"Simon Guy Fässler","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615c41a5c8a2d4008c7a72ab","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3259561,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Roman Orza","original_name":"Roman Orza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615c41dca336120086cf9d71","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1826761","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1lnN4VQ51Q9aDWuWF5q8DN00F2d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4PidLPN4rGu68LrBgg8RhbieR4l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bxUsKT4Znq0rY1XysiDss4vOw1A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aU1vDGWjqEMMG9fFbVZ6oKo70MR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tx4gw0V24w1yswZmzDNXc1gLrPV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w8Oo2iGd8WQ0jwAastwV8wS42Wv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pdobH3o7sKDHaxW0HmowXlobFJU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":534},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5sGzYVg08qjarhUQfioO7SD2seD.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":192471,"name":"orchestra conductor"},{"id":303226,"name":"artfilm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Solothurn, Solothurner Filmtage","release_date":"2011-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
