Teeming with raucous hilarity and channeling the series’ one-of-a-kind, trademark voice, Designing Women sets out to re-unite its audience—if nothing else—in laughter. It’s 2020, and Julia, Suzanne, Mary Jo, and Charlene are partners in the Atlanta-based interior design firm, Sugarbaker’s—but with the firm in crisis, they’re on the verge of a radical decision to sell the business and separate. A timely, whip-smart and deeply funny new Southern comedy set to take the theatre world by storm.","popularity":1.0463,"poster_path":"/jiWxdfuQiN6ng29tDMu7mLT3mwu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159836,"logo_path":null,"name":"TheatreSquared","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Designing Women","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1622660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Colonna","original_name":"Sarah Colonna","popularity":0.1502,"profile_path":"/1R14YeC8YDB42MoiFnMBRv6QDvr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mary Jo Shively","credit_id":"615d2093373ac200894197d8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2220239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen Cusack","original_name":"Carmen Cusack","popularity":0.0477,"profile_path":"/gi3xzBBTIob750G3JmNHWRQVavV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Julia Sugarbaker","credit_id":"615d209ca35c8e0062a6f483","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2049412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"R.
