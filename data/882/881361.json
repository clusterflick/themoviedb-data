Recalling Robert Jay Lifton's concept of fragmentary awareness, we form surreal sequences from these visual thoughts in order to create our own narratives of the real events that are difficult to comprehend. In this video, natural imagery unfolds into a surreal cycle of destruction, death, and rebirth. The fragmented footage, taken from three coastlines in the United States, is edited into new forms - accentuating nature's close interplay with itself and us. The soundtrack, taken from the ambient sound of the source footage, is manipulated and layered with synth drones - reinforcing the intense and uncanny relationship between memory and reality.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/6zvtOSXMsFkPI42qvO2nkNBGCdb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Through the Rift","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3259490,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikey Peterson","original_name":"Mikey Peterson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615c2d77d144430088cb152a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3259490,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikey Peterson","original_name":"Mikey Peterson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615c2d51a33612006120440d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3259490,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikey Peterson","original_name":"Mikey Peterson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615c2d710c12550029f23143","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6zvtOSXMsFkPI42qvO2nkNBGCdb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Lucca Film Festival & Europa Cinema","release_date":"2021-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
