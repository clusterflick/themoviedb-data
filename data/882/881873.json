Comedy is hard.\" Familiar words for any comic, but for Jason Barnes, comedy provides a brief oasis in a world of confusion, uncertainty and personal turmoil. Wits End follows Jason as he works rooms large and small throughout the country, building a reputation as an up-and-comer in the world of standup. All the while, his off stage struggles to make sense of the world around him threaten to send him over the edge of both a personal and professional breakdown. Honest, bittersweet and often hilarious, Wits End takes audiences on a journey of comedy, sadness and learning to find life no matter where you are along the road.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life is hard.
