He seeks refuge in the city of Oviedo, Asturias, wandering the empty streets at night, going to parties that are veritable circuses full of wannabes, and attending concerts and religious and traditional ceremonies as he seeks inspiration for his next film. He reminisces about his childhood but, most importantly, that strange woman who asked him to visit her at her apartment at precisely 10 p.m., not one minute more, nor one minute less.","popularity":0.381,"poster_path":"/yJUDLgHISYHvEGoHSNV266zIUec.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8492,"logo_path":"/wYhNCpXIThYDXevad6n90vsMXZ2.png","name":"RTP","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":162075,"logo_path":null,"name":"La
