Myth and legend overlap with history and politics as the women’s struggle is laid to bear in the individual stories and achievements of those featured in the film. The fragmented mosaic of voices and scenes allow for a plurality of views and opinions to account for the multifaceted and complex nature of Filipinas. From poetry to dance, politics to poetry – women chart their own lives in the auspicious event of change happening with the ascent of a woman to the country’s pinnacle of power.","popularity":0.3183,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goethe-Institut","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ynang-Bayan: To Be a Woman Is to Live at a Time of War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1289629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Deocampo","original_name":"Nick Deocampo","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/27zXf6TFV6yZmD4ErPUcawWdUs1.jpg","credit_id":"615c5aa80bc529008784b498","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1289629,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Deocampo","original_name":"Nick Deocampo","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":"/27zXf6TFV6yZmD4ErPUcawWdUs1.jpg","credit_id":"615c5adba336120043330040","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1193501,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ian Victoriano","original_name":"Ian Victoriano","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615c5aec36390900438d11ba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93529,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yam Laranas","original_name":"Yam Laranas","popularity":0.1401,"profile_path":"/psXmrZWSPR5KmqjLHULH0MxgfyM.jpg","credit_id":"615c5aff0bc529008784b557","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1204298,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Louie Quirino","original_name":"Louie Quirino","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615c5b12a336120061207aec","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0103310","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":264024,"name":"women power"},{"id":273967,"name":"war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"YNANG BAYAN (Teaser)","key":"70841464","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-07-23T07:19:07.000Z","id":"615c5bf5c8a2d4008c7a98fb"}]}}}
