To express discontent, Shih-Yen moves in with his mistress. Despite feeling overwhelmed by her messy personal life, Ko-Ching manages to lead her company and delivers a successful fashion show. The film reflects on career women’s struggles between family and work, it also describes the gender role stereotypes in a marriage.
