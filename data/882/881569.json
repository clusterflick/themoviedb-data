They show us the first globalized society, linked by rail, transatlantic travel, the airplane, and the telephone. We witness the high life in the French capital, the excesses of the wealthy gentlemen and their taste for money, pleasure, extravagance, and… women. Only rarely do the archives peek behind the scenes at the darker side of this period in history. But when they do, the images are gripping.\r In this new world, war was thought to belong to the past. No one imagined that within 14 years, the interval of peace and prosperity would be buried in the mud of the WWI’s trenches.","popularity":0.0902,"poster_path":"/fOYVSbJAevhFwldgdWWBgac0LSO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paris 1900: The City of Lights","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1972812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugues Nancy","original_name":"Hugues Nancy","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Director","credit_id":"615d033c0bc5290087863625","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1972812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugues Nancy","original_name":"Hugues Nancy","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63c970d2142ef1007d87924f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fOYVSbJAevhFwldgdWWBgac0LSO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
