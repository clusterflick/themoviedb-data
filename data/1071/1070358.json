He sent Mary Jane a necklace and a note in which he promised on his honor to someday discharge his debt. It happened later, that one of Bill's horses was stolen. Bill and his friends found the thief, and were bringing him into town to a handy tree, when they passed Mary Jane, drawing water from the old well. Bill had a drink and Mary, in pity, raised the cup to the lips of Bob Ford, the horse thief, whom she had never seen before.","popularity":0.1473,"poster_path":"/u5gY6aMxhloMI5fg6T0dicO7Bxm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168423,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.
