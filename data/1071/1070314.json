Little Alice is a child of this kind and although she is surrounded by the most meager, even poor circumstances she has a great desire to be an actress. Her mother, who takes in washing, sends the little girl to deliver a large basket of clothes. Struggling along the street she stops at the theater to look at a display of photographs of actors and actresses who are appearing there. She loses herself in reverie; while thus engaged the leading lady, whose picture particularly attracts the child's attention, arrives for rehearsal. She speaks to Alice, becomes interested in her and gives her two tickets for the afternoon performance. Pleased and delighted with the gifts she rushes home to her mother who takes the tickets from her, scolds and whips her for not attending to her errand.","popularity":0.2139,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":168423,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.
