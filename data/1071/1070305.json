Whole families live on this nefarious trade and many of them die by it. The men who work at this business are constantly hunted by United States revenue officers as violators of the law for manufacturing of liquor without a special license. The \"Mountain wife\" loves her husband and stands by and shields him from his enemies, the officers; when they are on his track she hides him, then throws them off his trail, giving him time to escape in the mountain fastnesses, as we are shown in this interesting and thrilling picture.","popularity":0.0985,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":168423,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.
