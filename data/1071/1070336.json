Billy James is Mary's special friend, and goes to bring her from the station, but, suffering snakes! Look what's traveling with her, his nobs, \"Sir Percy Granville,\" who owns the nearby ranch. This gets Bill's goat for a time, but Mary rides and \"ropes\" with the punchers, and soon shows them she is the same genuine, good-hearted Mary, and doesn't care a whoop for Sir Percy. Sir Percy insists on sticking around, however, and shows his true nature by striking Mary's younger brother, Bobby, when he defends his sister from insult.","popularity":0.3542,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":168423,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.
