This delightful tale, told through the eyes of four high school students, is a philosophical investigation, moral fable, coming-out, and coming-of-age story all at once. When Miss F. disappears, unlikely companions Kaylee, Tiffany, Edgar, and Morgan reach across their social strata to try to solve the mystery. In the end, they may find a renewed respect not only for Miss F. and her struggles but for each other as well.","popularity":0.0473,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miss Finknagle Succumbs to Chaos","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3859643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Morse","original_name":"Lisa Morse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Miss Finknagle","credit_id":"63b7358606f98400913004b0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3859644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haley Anderson","original_name":"Haley Anderson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tiffany","credit_id":"63b735a493bd69007a9c0758","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3859645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn de los Reyes","original_name":"Evelyn de los Reyes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Morgan","credit_id":"63b735bb73520500d3db27b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3859646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Hecker","original_name":"Jessica Hecker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Kaylee","credit_id":"63b735cb73520500d3db27c7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3859647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Lazaro Rumohr","original_name":"James Lazaro Rumohr","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Student","credit_id":"63b735e173520500a78e816c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2729704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anastasia Pritchard","original_name":"Anastasia Pritchard","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sandra","credit_id":"63b735f724b33300e2ff9e46","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3108115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vince-Anthony","original_name":"Vince-Anthony","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Edgar","credit_id":"63b736104cbe12009249cab2","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1312182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amy Harrison","original_name":"Amy Harrison","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b7333824b33300e2ff9d7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3859642,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kirk Shimano","original_name":"Kirk Shimano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b73543f04d010087cc6743","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2918786","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
