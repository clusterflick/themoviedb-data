Knocked out by an organic disease, he is in a bad way not only physically but financially. He has an interesting daughter, a bright boy and a good wife who are well thought of by the people of the neighborhood in which they live, among whom is a young minister. The doctor who attends the old boxer sees that nothing but a complete change to some warmer climate will benefit the patient and also recognizes that under the circumstances the change would be impossible unless someone comes to his assistance with the necessary money to defray the expense. The physician writes a note to the young clergyman telling him of his diagnosis of the case and his conclusions. The young divine hastens to see the sick man.","popularity":0.1398,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":168423,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.
