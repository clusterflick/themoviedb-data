The film is a coming-of-age story, following Mihku on his journey towards a career as a musician and rise to stardom in the midst of varying expectations. He’s charmed the crowd on Talent Suomi and proudly wears the Sámi clothing he has styled himself. He raps and yoiks in harmony, designs his own brand on his computer but also masters the skill of laborious reindeer herding. Above all, he sees his own unique roots and the Sámi language as his greatest strength. The future makes him wonder: to follow his father’s footsteps or to reach for his dreams.","popularity":0.2685,"poster_path":"/1RP6rWz3uzSZj3T9q6zVe2YoExv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":214689,"logo_path":null,"name":"DocArt","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2023-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Northern Sami","iso_639_1":"se","name":""},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rap and Reindeer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Guovssahasaid ráppár","type":"Title in Northern Sami"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3859302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mihkku Laiti","original_name":"Mihkku Laiti","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63b6e60c7352050087eb0ae0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1593714,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matti Näränen","original_name":"Matti Näränen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65678289d954200138762b4d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2097144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petteri Saario","original_name":"Petteri Saario","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65678291a3491100e1cadb9c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2097144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petteri Saario","original_name":"Petteri Saario","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b6e5d843250f0082e8c4a5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2818547,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tiina Saario","original_name":"Tiina Saario","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b6e5ecf44f27007d700a7c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2097144,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petteri Saario","original_name":"Petteri Saario","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b6e5cc735205007daba7b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26244658","wikidata_id":"Q116547648","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1822,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/27oBLMnZY2iuwHuUaAfhe5pbDW4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3240},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/glmFbpRWpjlIdKLIC5CDzCRXXAZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fi","file_path":"/1RP6rWz3uzSZj3T9q6zVe2YoExv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4562,"name":"rapper"},{"id":2806,"name":"lapland"},{"id":258394,"name":"sami people"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Bulgarian Edition","release_date":"2024-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DocPoint - Helsinki Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2023-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Korea International Ethnographic Film Festival","release_date":"2024-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"OKO International Etnographic Film Festival: Ukrainian Edition","release_date":"2024-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
