Billy has received a letter and stops on his way home in an opening in the woods to read it. While thus engaged, an Indian girl is making her way through the woods. \"Black Pete\" coming along the pass sees and attacks her. Billy springs to her defense and knocks \"Pete\" down; in falling he strikes his head on a stone and is killed.","popularity":0.0671,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":168423,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.
