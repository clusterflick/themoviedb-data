For several years, this working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Paris has been undergoing an urban metamorphosis. In the surrounding buildings, the inhabitants are living this transformation on a daily basis, between resignation, adaptation and aspirations. Through a back-and-forth game between intimate trajectories and the metamorphosis of the city, the film sketches moments in the lives of several of its inhabitants, drawing a portrait of a neighborhood at its turning point.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/rrXHi5zgDlukIxTbuBtG1X88t22.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Porte de Clichy","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3859705,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sébastien Marziniak","original_name":"Sébastien Marziniak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b746ee4cbe12007e127c48","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23149550","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/rrXHi5zgDlukIxTbuBtG1X88t22.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
