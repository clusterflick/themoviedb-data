Filmed sequences of one villager taken at various times during his disease, are presented to illustrate the clinical course and manifestations of the disease in this man. The man is seen after he is bitten but before he manifests symptoms overtly, the third day of his disease, and the fifth day of the disease. Scenes taken as the patient dies are also included. A doctor is also shown as he apparently examined the man to verify that death has occurred.","popularity":0.3121,"poster_path":"/oUONGTbdyaMWpgX0PHyMDKcGrqD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47946,"logo_path":null,"name":"United States Army","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1955-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rabies in Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3860040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Carleton Gajdusek","original_name":"Daniel Carleton Gajdusek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b7909bf44f270082ca86db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oUONGTbdyaMWpgX0PHyMDKcGrqD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1994,"name":"wolf"},{"id":18009,"name":"iran"},{"id":18257,"name":"educational"},{"id":158303,"name":"rabies"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1955-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rabies in Man (US Army Medical Service, 1955)","key":"OOu2JjQmS6Y","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-12-01T22:16:42.000Z","id":"63b7926324b33300931b8af9"}]}}}
