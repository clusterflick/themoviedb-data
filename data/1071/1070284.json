Made in the 1970s, the film carefully lays out major historical events, as with the stunning footage of the German Zeppelin Hindenburg bursting into flames over New Jersey in 1937. Powerful images such as this are both literal and metaphoric documents of the tragedies of the age. By relying on the old newsreels alone to depict the events, the filmmakers immerse us in the period in a way that would not have been possible had they interviewed a team of experts. Compared to some of the more freely associated assemblages presented in the series—and especially to Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?—this film seems stoic, contemplative. When left to speak for themselves, archival images can be most illuminating.","popularity":0.2865,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"America Lost and Found","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Hingle","original_name":"Pat Hingle","popularity":0.6338,"profile_path":"/QBAxFVZQ0Hu6rxlFavhwUq0zug.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"652710680cb33516f5c793cc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2615880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lance Bird","original_name":"Lance Bird","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652710ac0cb33516f745b445","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":70366,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arthur Gorson","original_name":"Arthur Gorson","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65271145cedac4013fabd61d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2615881,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Johnson","original_name":"Tom Johnson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6527112acedac400c53f5b0d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2615880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lance Bird","original_name":"Lance Bird","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652710a50cb33516f5c793d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102661,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Crowley","original_name":"John Crowley","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65271135629b2c00ac5f2995","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1039163,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kate Hirson","original_name":"Kate Hirson","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652711511f3e6000ff83d033","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2615881,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Johnson","original_name":"Tom Johnson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"652710caea84c700eba008eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0162851","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"(U.S. Film Festival)","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
