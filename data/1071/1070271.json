Booth Walker, a stranded thespian of the \"legitimate drama.\" who has been touring the west with a company presenting \"Othello.\" The company has yielded to the stress of bad business and has closed, while Mr. Walker, finding no easier way to return to Chicago, is counting the ties along the railroad. He comes to a small station, where several half intoxicated cowboys are assembled, and the idea comes to one of them that Mr. Walker be made to do a \"stunt.\" They fire at his feet until he dances, but he is so adept at the graceful art of Terpsichore, that they soon watch him in admiration, and reward him with liberal applause.","popularity":0.0414,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":168423,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.
