Bob was not all bad, but he was woefully weak and could not stick long at any one task. Also he paid more attention to rolling cigarettes than he did to his work. One day he was discharged by the foreman of the crockery store where he worked and appeared at home disgusted and sullen. His mother tried to comfort him, but the boy was anxious to have his way and announced his intention of going west, where he thought there would be better opportunities for him.","popularity":0.1752,"poster_path":"/r4rGQFjfUtomfvs9gNy7iq1QsTv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168423,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.
