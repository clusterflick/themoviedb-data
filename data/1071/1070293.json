It furnishes a theme for this well-drawn and lively drama of home life, a tramp's gratitude and the cordiality of the little child who loses through an accident the canary bird which was given her by her father. A tramp calls at the child's home for a \"hand out.\" The mother gives him something to eat, the child provides him with a loaf of bread and sends him on his way rejoicing. Shortly after the tramp has taken his departure the little girl tries to hang the cage with the bird in it on a nail on the porch. The cage falls to the ground and the bird escapes. Her mother is provoked and reprimands her for her carelessness.","popularity":0.176,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":168423,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.
