Consequently, when a sleek looking tenderfoot asked to become a boarder at the \"Flying B\" Margie favored him, though her father was suspicious. Margie is soon smitten with the stranger, much to the chagrin of Jack, the foreman, with whom Margie had previously been very friendly. Jack does not get ugly over the matter, but keeps his eyes open.","popularity":0.0946,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":168423,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.
