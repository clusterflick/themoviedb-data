The story of a young man who suffered unpaid wages may be a bit of a common theme, but 'Winter Sleep' is a movie with great absorbing power. The natural situations and acting allow you to become immersed and empathize throughout the movie. I feel unfair, tired, sad, and angry along with the main character, Seongju. I want Seongju to get the unpaid wages and make good movies, I want my younger brother to become a civil servant, and I want the CEO to go bankrupt. And I also want to eat chicken. A different brand of chicken than the one Seongju ordered.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/uuFFNYDGoj9Hj16kKCEfN54sSH1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2017-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winter Sleep","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uuFFNYDGoj9Hj16kKCEfN54sSH1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
