After finishing university, she comes back to her homeland from New York. The life was following its own route in her absence. Everything is foreign here for the returned Helen. Helen tries not only to find her place in Tbilisi - once a familiar environment for her - but also to find herself and find the keys that fit the locks of the main existential questions of life. Her encounter with film director Gabo is the start of an adventure that takes us into the minds and souls of a man and a woman, and old and a young soul. Their encounter is the start of a journey that encompasses more than just physical trip.","popularity":0.1745,"poster_path":"/oJ1dtC1E9zVqXLZIckBED7KQpvz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":189866,"logo_path":"/6YIOF0DF18EoUEQBG2vg0egbI9A.png","name":"Wagonnet
