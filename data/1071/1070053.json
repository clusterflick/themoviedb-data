While it borrows images from Kafka's Metamorphosis and from Jack Arnold's Incredible Shrinking Man, it is not an interpretation of either. This is a film about logic that feeds on itself. In developing its own peculiar logic, the film plays with narrative form. A METAMORPHOSIS IN LOGIC is the meditation of a man who can't decide whether he has gone too far or not far enough.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/j9bab9MTtaBNXvwWHBcgn1acwsl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Metamorphosis in Logic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2349234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brady Lewis","original_name":"Brady Lewis","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b6d68d7ac82900ae524aa8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j9bab9MTtaBNXvwWHBcgn1acwsl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
