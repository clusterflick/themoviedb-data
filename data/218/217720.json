Julian’s got a great idea to make money this Christmas, Ricky gets confused between God and Santa, and Bubbles tries to get the Boys together for an annual Christmas bonfire.  Meanwhile, Mr. Lahey is thrilled because Christmas is the only day of the year that his wife Barb allows him to have a few drinks. Directed by series creator Mike Clattenburg, this hour-long special takes place before Jamie was J-Roc, before Randy and Lahey were a couple, and before the Shitmobile was missing a door.","popularity":0.9744,"poster_path":"/fta1ZO9uLsFPgEMPDcgUf2PFxKI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special","video":false,"vote_average":6.959,"vote_count":49,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"The Trailer Park Boys Christmas Special","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Paul Tremblay","original_name":"John Paul Tremblay","popularity":0.4025,"profile_path":"/o0yFQYhYY8fm1sybGjqJscIrhzr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Julian","credit_id":"52fe4e3cc3a368484e215cc9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robb Wells","original_name":"Robb Wells","popularity":0.3093,"profile_path":"/zwpMgBzwwgatHBnyvaxUG2VWfoX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ricky","credit_id":"52fe4e3cc3a368484e215cd1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Smith","original_name":"Mike Smith","popularity":0.7789,"profile_path":"/36FbgvqpEUyrpTpW4qxcXI91ZVs.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bubbles","credit_id":"567a1d89c3a3685bd2000e56","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Dunsworth","original_name":"John Dunsworth","popularity":0.2319,"profile_path":"/lOFaPWFbtr733afDTcWeJlPODDn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jim Lahey","credit_id":"64ccf3f5764b99013af72fd4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Roach","original_name":"Patrick Roach","popularity":0.1321,"profile_path":"/5sWC8nwSE2iKKYOA5wYuk47dIUg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Randy","credit_id":"64ccf40443cd5400add650a8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":60970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Decoutere","original_name":"Lucy Decoutere","popularity":0.2936,"profile_path":"/xbR1KVKNm8HGrhxqMJ8xIROUCcG.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Lucy","credit_id":"64ccf41043cd54011c8de990","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82705,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Sarah Dunsworth","original_name":"Sarah Dunsworth","popularity":0.0809,"profile_path":"/3OcWMRlLhHioUV01Cse5pcI7qwh.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"64ccf41d2f266b09ef12417e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cory Bowles","original_name":"Cory Bowles","popularity":0.168,"profile_path":"/lY5hSQK41aMNyivZVcKiSd87zYo.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Cory","credit_id":"64ccf42743cd540139cdeb9e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Jackson","original_name":"Michael Jackson","popularity":0.2682,"profile_path":"/6oDcEeNHsyj0Qr3V4bp0aC330O.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Trevor","credit_id":"64ccf4382f266b09ee3c2c3f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Torrens","original_name":"Jonathan Torrens","popularity":0.3583,"profile_path":"/oO2aVbU57tcX2KZbjAbuUEdkBdG.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"J-Roc","credit_id":"64ccf449798e06011d81fe84","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyrone Parsons","original_name":"Tyrone Parsons","popularity":0.2926,"profile_path":"/yUskiMQGbHp68Z02R85ke1cZIT5.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Tyrone 'T'","credit_id":"64ccf464e04d8a3aab19fa46","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barrie Dunn","original_name":"Barrie Dunn","popularity":0.3592,"profile_path":"/vVF7qc17jbAB4NmGoUswqW44EP3.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Ray","credit_id":"64ccf48b764b99011df5dfd5","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4257148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Wm.
