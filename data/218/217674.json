Going along with Mougin to stop the bombing is Lyza, whose brother was killed by this group of fascists, and so she is ardently seeking revenge. After Mougin gets his hands on a videotape that reveals the plot to blow up the concert and its audience, he and Lyza join forces. As the fuse gets shorter and shorter, Mougin is also joined by sympathetic street gangs. Thus reinforced, he faces his opposition (including crooked cops) in increasingly more desperate attempts to stop Murmeau, the leader of the Nazi gang, from carrying out his terrorist objective.","popularity":0.2383,"poster_path":"/qlQc2r3h4hen7Iq1r4HZMprWZpS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50582,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lira
