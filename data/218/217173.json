Charlie Ruggles plays a hubby whose bungled business schemes force his wife, Fay Bainter, to enter the workplace. The couple's daughter, Marjorie Reynolds, shows up with her twin babies in tow. Son Arthur Lake arrives with his pregnant wife (Jeff Donnell). And overbearing maiden aunt Helen Broderick also decides to move in. Because his wife is away at work, poor old Charlie Ruggles is not only housekeeper, but nursemaid and servant as well.","popularity":1.2738,"poster_path":"/d6LpMJiYihaV7N6sMLZX3rZBD4S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4213,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sol Lesser
