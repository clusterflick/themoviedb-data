Alice in the Cities, Wrong Move and Kings of the Road became foundations of the German New Wave and cemented the reputation of their director.  In One Who Set Forth: Wim Wenders' Early Years Marcel Wehn explores the background to these films. Through personal recollection and rare home movie footage, it documents the director's early life, from experiments with his first camera, via his deviation from a career in medicine in favour of art and film, through to international recognition for the Road Trilogy. Central to these were themes that became cornerstones of all his work: national identity, the importance of personal relationships and the allure of the road.  With contributions from the director and the many collaborators who helped define his vision, One Who Set Forth is a compelling account of Wim Wenders' life and work.","popularity":0.4269,"poster_path":"/bx0fifvEcsamEQWb61qU7sBXbRA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41653,"logo_path":"/xUpb9kIB7024PW0PW55NHmfAV6D.png","name":"INDI
