They instruct the kids of a village to keep an eye on the prisoner. While the younger kids gradually become friends with the stranger, the older boy called Pang has a different attitude. Since he grew up without parents, he accepted the Khmer rouge as his replacement parents and endears himself to them by betraying villagers. When Pang becomes responsible for watching the prisoner, things become worse for the pilot.","popularity":0.3183,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"KH","name":"Cambodia"}],"release_date":"2011-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Catch","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cyril Gueï","original_name":"Cyril Gueï","popularity":0.1823,"profile_path":"/YgOSxCmC660SDdcDyQW3mEirof.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Simon Jefferson Lewis","credit_id":"52fe4e2cc3a368484e212437","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jhem Chuop","original_name":"Jhem Chuop","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pang","credit_id":"52fe4e2cc3a368484e21243b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rithy Panh","original_name":"Rithy Panh","popularity":0.1782,"profile_path":"/fMfHlfQMTGbg17DfDR0WSyg9xOj.jpg","credit_id":"64dd75dc59e8a900e2288684","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63121,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michel Fessler","original_name":"Michel Fessler","popularity":0.1115,"profile_path":"/bHnaLmhJMn0g9RD80Dg8wbHS7As.jpg","credit_id":"64dd75d659e8a900c5a06061","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201854,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kenzaburô Oe","original_name":"大江健三郎","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd75e35ab81a013918f2b4","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129917,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc Marder","original_name":"Marc Marder","popularity":0.1302,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd75f6d100b614b5f722a2","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rithy Panh","original_name":"Rithy Panh","popularity":0.1782,"profile_path":"/fMfHlfQMTGbg17DfDR0WSyg9xOj.jpg","credit_id":"64dd7602d100b614b2ef1b9a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1461722,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Catherine Dussart","original_name":"Catherine Dussart","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd75ef5ab81a00ffc0cd3e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":129920,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marie-Christine Rougerie","original_name":"Marie-Christine Rougerie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd7608b77d4b1141f86709","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2176780,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Benoit Cisilkiewick","original_name":"Benoit Cisilkiewick","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd761159e8a900c5a060ac","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129918,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Prum Mésar","original_name":"Prum Mesa","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64dd75fc37109700ac43d405","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rithy Panh","original_name":"Rithy Panh","popularity":0.1782,"profile_path":"/fMfHlfQMTGbg17DfDR0WSyg9xOj.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e2cc3a368484e212433","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2075188","wikidata_id":"Q1193317","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
