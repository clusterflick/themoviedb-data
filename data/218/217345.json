Constant paranoia and a feeling of being followed has caused her to be institutionalized. Now she finds herself trapped between what is real, and what may be real, as her doctors tell her one thing, and her mind tells her another.

You never know who is watching you.","popularity":0.1906,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Who Is Watching You","title":"The Locker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":233877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel S.
