The partnership has some hard times, especially during the feud between ASCAP and the radio networks, when only public-domain songs like \"I Dream of Jeannie\" were permitted to be broadcast.","popularity":1.3887,"poster_path":"/t8mwwnBnWUAAOwBMBfMYgpAu8Ns.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25,"logo_path":"/qZCc1lty5FzX30aOCVRBLzaVmcp.png","name":"20th Century Fox","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Youâ€™ll Swing into High","title":"I'll Get By","video":false,"vote_average":5.417,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":226642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"June Haver","original_name":"June Haver","popularity":0.4863,"profile_path":"/dVgc2vcWgcIoy1ZWSBjwTXN8pRQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Liza Martin","credit_id":"52fe4e2ac3a368484e211d35","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Lundigan","original_name":"William Lundigan","popularity":0.1905,"profile_path":"/8iO4Ttj5QmXaRbeqUxEB4g2ftoP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"William Spencer","credit_id":"52fe4e2ac3a368484e211d3d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":120306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria DeHaven","original_name":"Gloria DeHaven","popularity":0.4518,"profile_path":"/ij6RuBeiDE0ugrBgBFfiMF0RkdY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Terry Martin","credit_id":"52fe4e2ac3a368484e211d39","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":170508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Day","original_name":"Dennis Day","popularity":0.1772,"profile_path":"/4gCBb3R1lJ17NE66MO5qAcV1Mz3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Freddy Lee","credit_id":"52fe4e2ac3a368484e211d41","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1227384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry James","original_name":"Harry James","popularity":0.1225,"profile_path":"/5eborPUQeLIeYlvOULPgM26uZvY.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Harry James","credit_id":"52fe4e2ac3a368484e211d55","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thelma Ritter","original_name":"Thelma Ritter","popularity":0.4706,"profile_path":"/q48Cf2evvi73qJULqhIotGrszaA.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Miss Murphy","credit_id":"52fe4e2ac3a368484e211d45","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Allen","original_name":"Steve Allen","popularity":0.4207,"profile_path":"/smfesYmaX6pfZefpYU6L69ePwiG.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Peter Pepper","credit_id":"52fe4e2ac3a368484e211d49","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":975304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Davenport","original_name":"Danny Davenport","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Chester Dooley","credit_id":"52fe4e2ac3a368484e211d4d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Antrim","original_name":"Harry Antrim","popularity":0.1981,"profile_path":"/rmOLsYDNZCKbqvMd5AMdwxE7icw.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mr. Olinville","credit_id":"52fe4e2ac3a368484e211d51","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bess Flowers","original_name":"Bess Flowers","popularity":0.4188,"profile_path":"/oErbIo6a2QPYZSqfdzU6vlDTD8i.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Lady in Audience at The Roxy","credit_id":"532d7387c3a3685fac001aa7","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82170,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Crain","original_name":"Jeanne Crain","popularity":0.3308,"profile_path":"/oPBKcsZ0sbPD8JnVI16oekFn0Ce.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5af9e2110e0a263b8b001e46","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1239975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert McCord","original_name":"Robert McCord","popularity":0.2547,"profile_path":"/vcv52yb5hqn6Ed5cncoHK3s4AEW.jpg","cast_id":33,"character":"Commentator","credit_id":"64614ac9a67254010109b964","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26024,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"William Perlberg","original_name":"William Perlberg","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621e324d5c324700448f91fe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14647,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cyril J.
