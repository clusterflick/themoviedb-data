When Herb and Dorothy Vogel, a retired postal clerk and librarian, began collecting works of contemporary art in the 1960s, they never imagined it would outgrow their one bedroom Manhattan apartment and spread throughout America. 50 years later, the collection is nearly 5,000 pieces and worth millions. Refusing to sell, the couple launches an unprecedented gift project giving artworks to one museum in all 50 states. The film journeys around the country with the Vogels, meeting artists who are famous or unknown, often controversial, striking today's society with questions about art and its survival.","popularity":0.4693,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"50 works of art to 50 states. 2500 extraordinary gifts from one ordinary couple.","title":"Herb & Dorothy 50x50","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Vogel","original_name":"Dorothy Vogel","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4e40c3a368484e21665d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1049431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Vogel","original_name":"Herbert Vogel","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4e40c3a368484e216661","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1053518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Antebi","original_name":"Paula Antebi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Herself -
