The 12 minute short film was filmed in 70mm Super Panavision, using a specially developed \"nature animation\" technique. The result is a magic flight in one single shot, along the remains of an internal village road. At the same time a whole year passes by at 50 000 times normal speed!  Most of the year, the village of Børfjord lies empty with virgin snow between cold houses. People show up only during a short and hectic summer season. But the cycles of nature go on as they have always done, totally independent of what people might do.","popularity":0.2605,"poster_path":"/xLbZrZGHdGKeiOMjL6Ru2S8MD4l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71331,"logo_path":null,"name":"Camera Magica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1991-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Year Along the Abandoned Road","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":21,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","title":"Året gjennom Børfjord","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150935,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Garbarek","original_name":"Jan Garbarek","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60c7c7ad18864b0040151983","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1202472,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Morten Skallerud","original_name":"Morten Skallerud","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e38c3a368484e214ef7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1202472,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Morten Skallerud","original_name":"Morten Skallerud","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56876d37c3a3685f8900cc3a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0103301","wikidata_id":"Q4583860","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":852,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hCT649Ec57Bgbb63uyI7GnV2nMz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1515},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":852,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1mxO1XMKGjtfaDykuTVHN6tXMj8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1515}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2670,"iso_639_1":"no","file_path":"/xLbZrZGHdGKeiOMjL6Ru2S8MD4l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11371,"name":"deserted town"},{"id":1191,"name":"norway"},{"id":8721,"name":"arctic polar circle region"},{"id":209173,"name":"abandoned"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
