What if a golem were fashioned out of dirt, much like Adam, and came to life? The film imagines it, in the desert and in Moscow. Interspersed are stories of a 14th-century Tuscan artist's creation of a tower that plays music when the wind blows, of a film director, and of Jeremiah and Sirat. In what ways is making a movie like creating a golem?","popularity":0.0679,"poster_path":"/hn0mIyUHVwW5yvUkvjjakqUrg1n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birth of a Golem","video":false,"vote_average":2.8,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amos Gitai","original_name":"Amos Gitai","popularity":0.2016,"profile_path":"/rzeDnQ8JSnshvhmM9hzk955Wg9R.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e2dc3a368484e212921","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2307,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Henri Alekan","original_name":"Henri Alekan","popularity":0.1201,"profile_path":"/rL2bZDa889sNXZOxfPwieE9ZzBb.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e2dc3a368484e212927","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0167302","wikidata_id":"Q3335237","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oFbPRPimKLXl8B6LG0lPirxX2wl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hn0mIyUHVwW5yvUkvjjakqUrg1n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
