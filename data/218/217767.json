Featuring local activists including Mark Ruffalo, 'Melissa Leo' , 'Natalie Merchant' , Pete Seeger, Citizen Cope and scientists like Sandra Steingraber, the film - a blend of 'The Last Waltz' and 'An Inconvenient Truth' lays out the science and facts behind the decision and encourages the governor to join the anti-fracking majority in his state. Though focused on the issue in New York, the education, and incredible music, are relevant in the 34 states that already allow fracking.","popularity":0.4792,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Governor Cuomo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Bowermaster","original_name":"Jon Bowermaster","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/AkmzNIP8X5C0SSRPXl5M6PxnPgW.jpg","credit_id":"53a80306c3a3687a3400508d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1296680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Bowermaster","original_name":"Jon Bowermaster","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/AkmzNIP8X5C0SSRPXl5M6PxnPgW.jpg","credit_id":"53a802fcc3a368749500459a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Gibney","original_name":"Alex Gibney","popularity":0.4984,"profile_path":"/kJp2tfLlg0smYgnhA8Fw5LBbRwC.jpg","credit_id":"670b8f5537d86d520bb0d491","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":111977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Merchant","original_name":"Natalie Merchant","popularity":0.2766,"profile_path":"/mrtHaufLvKd6gk5HJUFU6QAtV5y.jpg","credit_id":"670b8f5c37d86d520bb0d495","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2578116","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
