Recounted through the personal accounts of key figures, both local and international, the documentary examines how South Africa avoided a civil war and moved towards, as Archbishop Desmond Tutu coined the phrase, \"a rainbow nation.\" From the evil legacy of apartheid to the triumphant first democratic elections, Miracle Rising: South Africa moves beyond mere chronology and delves into the hearts and minds of the leaders and people of South Africa, culminating in the thrilling behind-the-scenes events of the elections that resulted in the joyful inauguration of President Nelson Mandela. Told through simple, intimate portraits of key players, it weaves a grand story of a nation into an intimate history of men and women determined to change the country for the best of all who live there.","popularity":2.2421,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South
