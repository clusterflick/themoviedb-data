The juxtaposition of these two simple structures invokes and implicates deeply conflicted and enduring foundational American myths concerning the scope and meaning of personal liberty, civic responsibility and the rule of law; individual conscience, democracy and civil disobedience; the transcendental value of nature, wilderness and the god-given right to exploit natural resources; American exceptionalism, environmental conservationism and faith in technological progress; the imperative to make oneself (anew), to ’succeed’ and, if necessary, to secede.","popularity":0.1048,"poster_path":"/h1cjFYsQurdCGUHR9BiVq4JXckg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Cabins","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012088,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Benning","original_name":"James Benning","popularity":0.405,"profile_path":"/tu91d7giNenHlHR8B0a4jRscJpA.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e37c3a368484e21496b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3223288","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/h1cjFYsQurdCGUHR9BiVq4JXckg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":811,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xzybab3tspBchlpEIexLqEXv5ux.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB ","release_date":"2011-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
