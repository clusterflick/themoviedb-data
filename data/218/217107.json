Detective Danny Glover, Scarborough Police’s premiere dog-napping-ring buster and general fat bastard, arrives in London to help the clinically psychotic Detective Sonny Boy with a little problem; Who is butchering London’s dogs?  The answer seems obvious at first, it must be Burger Priest, the Pope’s neo-nazi clown-chef fast food empire!  The detectives embark on a covert mission to uncover Burger Priest’s dark secret, but even they are unprepared for the true horror and depth of the fast food franchise’s depravity.  Assisted by Feety, a heroin-addicted fetus, and Ellen Mellon, a New York reporter who also happens to be an animated ventriloquist’s doll, they must reveal the Pope’s evil plan and shut down Burger Priest for good!","popularity":0.2419,"poster_path":"/hvr8kmcL7n5Huj8vY7NW5Mzb5PY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16483,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yankee Disco Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":3052,"logo_path":"/kqP7DC8cUCzDSI5SXiJKJKmQg1K.png","name":"Troma Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"If only God existed, maybe he could help you.","title":"The Evolved: Part One","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Senior","original_name":"Andrew Senior","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e28c3a368484e211827","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201753,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Turner","original_name":"John Turner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e28c3a368484e21182d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201755,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Man of Bronze","original_name":"Man of Bronze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e28c3a368484e211839","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1063328,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Phillip Barron","original_name":"Phillip Barron","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f65a1d557530e0039a88245","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0818672","wikidata_id":"Q7732724","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hvr8kmcL7n5Huj8vY7NW5Mzb5PY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1003}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2652,"name":"nazi"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Evolved, Part One","key":"UZxUbKZ_CqM","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2006-07-02T16:04:51.000Z","id":"5f0881c51f98d1003619bae3"}]}}}
