Mark Stevens plays horse breeder Jeff Keane, who loses his prize stallion in a train accident. While the stallion roams wild and free, Keane enlists the aid of rancher Joan Hartley (Coleen Gray) in searching for the animal. Once the horse is located, it is clear that it has developed a mean streak, the result of various cruelties inflicted upon it by humans. Jeff and Joan combine their efforts to regain the horse's friendship. Veteran Native American actors Iron Eyes Cody and Jay Silverheels make significant supporting appearances. Sand was attractively filmed in Technicolor on location in Colorado.","popularity":0.8458,"poster_path":"/vNQu41qYMEHFnddflngccAIVM1r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25,"logo_path":"/qZCc1lty5FzX30aOCVRBLzaVmcp.png","name":"20th Century Fox","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sand","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Stevens","original_name":"Mark Stevens","popularity":0.1898,"profile_path":"/rVafnpB0ZmDsjCSMqTxOB9NC5ZR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jeff Keane","credit_id":"52ff43d6c3a3680f34158b86","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Coleen Gray","original_name":"Coleen Gray","popularity":1.5994,"profile_path":"/9DLWFJofnWiXlzIBVweDRRPed90.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Joan Hartley","credit_id":"52ff43f0c3a3680f1e159493","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rory Calhoun","original_name":"Rory Calhoun","popularity":0.5838,"profile_path":"/3ZQP79a5QzY8xRwMttRAtjjNDYF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Chick Palmer","credit_id":"52ff43fcc3a3680ef3134cd5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Grapewin","original_name":"Charley Grapewin","popularity":0.4917,"profile_path":"/xROPwMkTUgweYQFhbTsvklIMhlw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Doug","credit_id":"52ff4411c3a3680f0815bf9e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Patten","original_name":"Robert Patten","popularity":0.176,"profile_path":"/5LdkirLlW9HEgur3AtCyQsDXQYS.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Boyd","credit_id":"5454f5a00e0a2648cb004544","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":127032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iron Eyes Cody","original_name":"Iron Eyes Cody","popularity":0.3244,"profile_path":"/23h9CuvnyzjJGYsodDTXbiaBuA.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Indian (uncredited)","credit_id":"5454f5bd0e0a2648d6004466","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1229431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Silverheels","original_name":"Jay Silverheels","popularity":0.3963,"profile_path":"/rrHuwINW4UtYEurYd6jmg7cO9QM.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Indian (uncredited)","credit_id":"5454f5e1c3a368147c004383","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4122262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hank Potts","original_name":"Hank Potts","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Stunts (uncredited)","credit_id":"6491fe8d42bf010101c07732","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis King","original_name":"Louis King","popularity":0.2298,"profile_path":"/al0ZaNyWF5GB9TOMTvYuoW9vHty.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e2ac3a368484e211dbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56927,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Martin Berkeley","original_name":"Martin Berkeley","popularity":0.1271,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5454f4180e0a2635de001fcd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1298968,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Will James","original_name":"Will James","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5454f445c3a3682be9001d31","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8508,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Thomas Little","original_name":"Thomas Little","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5454f5110e0a2648d200460a","department":"Art","job":"Set Decoration"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8502,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Darryl F.
