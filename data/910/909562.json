The sisters are less than thrilled by the idea of spending time together: Vicky loves Christmas, whereas Kristina no longer enjoys the holiday without their mom. With strong convincing from Aunt Debbie, the sisters reluctantly accept her gift. Once they arrive at the resort, Kristina and Vicky run into Reginé (Kyana Teresa), a famous singer and one-time best friend who left them behind when fame came calling.","popularity":0.6465,"poster_path":"/ctgwGyHqteiUU2T1njo4DNxZiZe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6679,"logo_path":"/r3r7qbHKgo8N0yr7r1TjLmzLXfQ.png","name":"MarVista Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sisterly Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2160419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Joy Winans","original_name":"Deborah Joy Winans","popularity":0.167,"profile_path":"/5NpwIfr5A8FL4U5oqhLaHLB3Pqy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kristina Marshall","credit_id":"61a6f4219d6e33004587aa7b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2098768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyana Teresa","original_name":"Kyana Teresa","popularity":0.2275,"profile_path":"/nNS3Cuqqd9lPiKp9I3XPe3gX1i4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Regine Radcliffe","credit_id":"61a6f4a000508a002c212dea","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neil Whitely","original_name":"Neil Whitely","popularity":0.2775,"profile_path":"/taPe9RjvEkgamMXiWqjC9EWSKRt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Colton Fisher","credit_id":"61a6f4c5c5c1ef00671c0394","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1918876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Michelle Cornelius","original_name":"Lisa Michelle Cornelius","popularity":0.114,"profile_path":"/n3VDmiiZHxvoGgFXicbx8u8IILT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Vicky Marshall","credit_id":"61a6f4fcfcb8cc008ced7a8a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marium Carvell","original_name":"Marium Carvell","popularity":0.158,"profile_path":"/oTedDy2i0gbG0D8gqqtsNJuLhjU.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Aunt Debbie","credit_id":"61a6f52a85c0a20063a37ec7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3244336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Reich","original_name":"Kelly Reich","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/vjWRNHm6vyceNozGInMv55FJ1sJ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gladys","credit_id":"61a6f54f2495ab009196a28b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2585522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alicia Richardson","original_name":"Alicia Richardson","popularity":0.1227,"profile_path":"/u2eOo9w6oJJH62wE9zo6XufzOin.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Daysha","credit_id":"61a6f57d9d6e33006769d43b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kendrick Cross","original_name":"Kendrick Cross","popularity":0.2747,"profile_path":"/tYaCFGV5EuxZpj2NOh2oDJ0yDyZ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Keith Fisher","credit_id":"61a6f5900284200066489d09","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerry LaMothe","original_name":"Jerry LaMothe","popularity":0.0893,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a6f5be4284ea0063054c07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2474084,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Angela Burt-Murray","original_name":"Angela Burt-Murray","popularity":0.0599,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a6f5d69d6e33006769d56a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3330894,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maryam Myika Day","original_name":"Maryam Myika Day","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a6f5eb3e2ec800458eca9c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1918176,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hayden Baptiste","original_name":"Hayden Baptiste","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a6f9cf4284ea0044f185fd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2223278,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Larry Grimaldi","original_name":"Larry Grimaldi","popularity":0.1047,"profile_path":"/lSizZbrTe1KGHN8yzWlGhf6xuac.jpg","credit_id":"61ce240241a561001cb60998","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew C.
