Pastel Hell incorporates stop-motion, live-action and VFX to build a multi-dimensional space where characters can develop while implementing a forced perspective. The film is set inside the mind of its lead character, a young woman who has spent the night partying a bit too hard. Her consciousness takes an exciting turn when she decides to call it a night, but things start to catch up with her. The concept of time appears in an embodied form, luring her in so she can't turn away. It causes her to spiral deeper into a world full of anxiety and paranoia - that of her inner self. Our protagonist is forced to face the fears of not only herself, but those of a generation coming to the realisation that time is endless, and we are stuck in a world without choice.","popularity":0.0661,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pastel Hell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3815860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeleine Magee Carr","original_name":"Madeleine Magee Carr","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/iEAOuaVhKpXgqhriehlo8B1A5Ug.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64b120999672ed00e30a7d3a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4161727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Kit Miklos Vadasz","original_name":"Hugo Kit Miklos Vadasz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b11ff84e4dff00ffd0e170","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4161733,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rachael Morrow","original_name":"Rachael Morrow","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b1207f253fab0c3e9e83bd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
