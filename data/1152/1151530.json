They come from diverse backgrounds and do not all speak the same language. In between prayers, they work to sustain their religious community. They sell handmade rosaries and operate guest rooms where they also accommodate refugees in need of shelter, such as Halyna, who fled from Ukraine. The older nuns teach the younger ones, transcending cultural boundaries. Every day, the sisters learn to live together a little better, always following the rules of Saint Benedict, whom they have followed into this cloistered life.","popularity":0.1692,"poster_path":"/hIodvAEOjNNJ0kNxxaf6kjrEdQh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113630,"logo_path":"/5usgm5sgqRQl0nzzIzt6pSpJXrb.png","name":"Les Batelières Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3632574,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lola Pidoux","original_name":"Lola Pidoux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64afd0f66a3448012ce803a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3386794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorraine David","original_name":"Lorraine David","popularity":0.1121,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64afd0eee24b935b338d9aac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oF6UdqpCbxN50JLxCwTdcYt2Rvi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":4.165,"height":387,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/cS0uT04Ztg1X16RWa3iLGLKm1pq.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":1612}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hIodvAEOjNNJ0kNxxaf6kjrEdQh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8eoXcLdmrgQauzC1466kg8H9B1A.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/QopS5HBrMYySkA0EzMQyeZPJwO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6150,"name":"faith"},{"id":1672,"name":"lifestyle"},{"id":256323,"name":"catholic monastery"},{"id":294531,"name":"documentary film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ARTE (La vie en face)","release_date":"2023-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
