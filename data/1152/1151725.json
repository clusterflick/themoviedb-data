It is a computer animation of falling paper, with a sound-track of people counting. By combining mathematical models of different physical phenomena such as gravity, elasticity and aerodynamics I can create abstracted simulations of natural systems. As well as the formal qualities that are explored in this work, I am interested in other possible readings. The endless flow of paper suggests the meditative space of a waterfall, yet also speaks of consumption and waste. Our lives are documented by a continual stream of paper, from birth and death certificates to supermarket receipts.\"","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":"/BongsR3Z0n2s8HyZVWHHeJNb5G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"These Are the Days","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4161036,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Tonkin","original_name":"John Tonkin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b082c56a3448010b7353f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/BongsR3Z0n2s8HyZVWHHeJNb5G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
