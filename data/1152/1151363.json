The population of these districts, depleted and aged by the migration of their youth, lives in a culture of 'absence,' nurturing longing for the children, grandchildren, and siblings who left the countryside behind in pursuit of the big city dream. The documentary provides a glimpse into the solitary daily lives of the residents of Belisário and portrays rural exodus from an inverse perspective: through the changes in the dynamics of the families remaining in the countryside. In other words, the changes in the lives of those who stay when others depart.","popularity":0.1026,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tudo que movimenta","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Everything that moves","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2449281,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thiago Yamachita","original_name":"Thiago Yamachita","popularity":0.1119,"profile_path":"/m83aD0XtKmuREzbzQWHVrz3bjPO.jpg","credit_id":"64af33fea410c80102ec1d7a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2449279,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matheus Peçanha","original_name":"Matheus Peçanha","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64af3327c49048011c2ef061","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4159535,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fred Cabala","original_name":"Fred Cabala","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64af33a4a410c8011f556400","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2449279,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matheus Peçanha","original_name":"Matheus Peçanha","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64af334ec4904800ac961e17","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4159534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thamara Pereira","original_name":"Thamara Pereira","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64af32fad6590b00e40b1410","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4159534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thamara Pereira","original_name":"Thamara Pereira","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64af330e6a3448012ce79b1f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28331988","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":759,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/ptUdZpFBmqCsMC1nmSnjdAxlw8I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1352}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"L","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
