Зонгшпиль","overview":"Filmed in April 2010, the film is based on real documents of Russian social and political life and on an analysis of the conflict that has developed around the planned Okhta Center development in Petersburg, where the Gazprom corporation intends to house the headquarters of its locally-based subsidiaries in a 403-meter-high skyscraper. The proposed skyscraper has provoked one of the fiercest confrontations between the authorities and society in recent Russian political history. Despite resistance on the part of various groups who believe that construction of the building would have a catastrophic impact on the appearance of the city, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Gazprom has so far managed to secure all the necessary permissions and has practically begun the first phase of construction.","popularity":0.1162,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":204765,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chto Delat Fund","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2013-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tower: A Songspiel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3383172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilgiz Bulgakov","original_name":"Ilgiz Bulgakov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"PR Manager","credit_id":"64bf98906ee3d70124a9478a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2931802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Afonin","original_name":"Альберт Афонин","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/1cY9Z6bpPCu6IkMHJbJOYjX81vd.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Politician","credit_id":"64bf989905822401303b211c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1797367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Vartanyan","original_name":"Анна Вартаньян","popularity":0.1125,"profile_path":"/qHnrreZUtiaFZT6ZZUM6f96Oeyo.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Gallery Owner","credit_id":"64bf98a601757f00c5ade106","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4179136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirill Danilov","original_name":"Kirill Danilov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Church Representative","credit_id":"64bf98bd0582240151f374f6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1931559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maksim Gudkov","original_name":"Maksim Gudkov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Contemporary Artist","credit_id":"64bf98cf6ee3d70143909674","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4179137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitriy Grankin","original_name":"Dmitriy Grankin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Security Chief","credit_id":"64bf98db6d4c9700ff4951cb","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3566757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Egorova","original_name":"Olga Egorova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ae4d738a0e9b00e375c23c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4179134,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rena Rädle","original_name":"Rena Rädle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bf985d05822400b0767880","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4179132,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dmitriy Vilenskiy","original_name":"Dmitriy Vilenskiy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bf984f6d4c9700e2761ab6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3566757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Egorova","original_name":"Olga Egorova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bf98576ee3d700c7faf57a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2773532","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
