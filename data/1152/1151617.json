The film is based upon key findings from an extensive research project, 'Knowing the Secret Police', and reflects upon how different kinds of knowledge were circulated through social, religious, political and literary networks within the former GDR. The filmmakers present this research with footage filmed at key locations throughout East Berlin and the wider surrounding landscape, including the Stasi archives and former HQ, Karl-Marx-Allee, Volkspark Friedrichshain, rural 'dacha' cabins, the urban neighbourhood of Prenzlauerberg and the social housing estates of Marzahn.","popularity":0.2925,"poster_path":"/oP4NCfMqGcXfCCsBcuTZVYGjxRI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Open Secret","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4160662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Zapp","original_name":"Andrea Zapp","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64b0249e20ecaf013ac917eb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459096,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacob Cartwright","original_name":"Jacob Cartwright","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b024c5e24b935b2e5b0843","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2077314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Jordan","original_name":"Nick Jordan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b0251b8a0e9b011d8e739d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2077314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Jordan","original_name":"Nick Jordan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b02525e24b935b30a302e3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4160671,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lord Mongo","original_name":"Lord Mongo","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b0250e6a344800ad78da08","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4160667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Jordan","original_name":"Nick Jordan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b024e020ecaf0100e6b6dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20449054","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oP4NCfMqGcXfCCsBcuTZVYGjxRI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1773,"name":"socialism"},{"id":1776,"name":"stasi"},{"id":156026,"name":"east germany"},{"id":244840,"name":"surveillance state"},{"id":267429,"name":"life in the gdr"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
