Combined, the layers form normal full-colour images of the elements which persist through time. Simultaneously transitory elements - animals, people, machines - move through these scenes in single colours, leaving only a brief trace, as if they're memories or ghosts who have left behind their past, present or future. Some people have lived for so long that they become as stable as their surroundings. With dignity they become stereotypes of themselves, representatives of traditions which are as much a part of the landscape as the buildings.  Three Dimensions of Time is part of (un)moved, a series of videos and photographs inspired by the photography of Sergey Prokudin-Gorskii (1863-1944) and how he applied the colour separation process.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Dimensions of Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16532052","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
