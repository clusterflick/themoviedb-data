In her tiny shop there are no spaces left uncovered, every shelf and surface is piled up with wonderful old treasures. But she's only able to keep going because she owns the freehold to her building, a luxury most junk stores can only dream of. She's a passionate maker of things too so has an astonishing collection of old buttons, lace, ribbon, beads and fabric. She talks about the demise of sewing skills among the young, how no one appreciates the workmanship in all the hand made stuff and the death of the retail shops during the pandemic in London.","popularity":0.2199,"poster_path":"/2cx0anCKmxRaDcL7ZK5JmNTkdiL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memories of Mortlake","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4161000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Forbes","original_name":"Mark Forbes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b07aa9d40d4c01019e1a60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13983264","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2cx0anCKmxRaDcL7ZK5JmNTkdiL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":212,"name":"london, england"},{"id":164186,"name":"character study"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BECTU WPD Film Night","release_date":"2023-07-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
