They find the strength in themselves and each other through their challenges to change their destinies. It's about making decisions and deals with real issues that get swept under the rug sometimes. It's about human compassion, inner strength and survival and shows that women can be strong and independent.  Also it reminds us that things aren't always as they seem.  It's about taking the cards you've been dealt and turning them into a winning hand.  In the story the characters are willing to take responsibility for their actions and face life's reality.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dbl Rein Beau","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4160454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lyn Owen","original_name":"Lyn Owen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b004076a3448014d353cf5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0387967","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
