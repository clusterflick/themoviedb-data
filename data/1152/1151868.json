The company was launched in 2014 by two young British brothers, Callum and Liam Negus-Fancey. Riding the wave of the tech boom which saw start-ups like Deliveroo, Airbnb and Uber become ‘unicorn’ giants valued at $1bn or more, the brothers created a simple idea that soon attracted huge investment. Beginning as a ticketing platform – giving festivals goers the chance to earn VIP rewards for selling tickets to their friends – the company tapped into a lucrative area when music festivals and Instagram influencing were flourishing. They promised their customers a ‘bigger life’, gave staff a glamorous, party-fuelled workplace and soon went global.","popularity":0.269,"poster_path":"/ddScPBTbVhRES0GDyoAsN5ZHM2Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155619,"logo_path":"/iBtgKtI1aOA6ZLe9an5IXqn2jn2.png","name":"BBC Three","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The jaw-dropping story of the spectacular rise and dramatic fall of British music and festival company Pollen.","title":"Crashed: $800m Festival Fail","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q123013219","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nr2dCz0c15C3HaeJYqgTOzXQRlP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ddScPBTbVhRES0GDyoAsN5ZHM2Z.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":680},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1Ba2f2C6s3WakN3WI7ne5LIwEGe.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1175}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9935,"name":"travel"},{"id":49960,"name":"business start-up"},{"id":160213,"name":"festival"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
