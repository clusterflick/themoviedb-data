The title is referring to the sound recording technique largely adopted by the post-war Italian cinema to cut costs with actors having to re-record the dialogues afterwards in a studio. A similar technique was used here, but the sound was recorded from the image on the right (library) and the actor had to lip-synch to the monologue on the spot in the image on the left (void).","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Italian Method","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","title":"Իտալական մեթոդը","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4160601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Martinez","original_name":"Linda Martinez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64b01b62d40d4c00e4399a90","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4160569,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Garush Melkonyan","original_name":"Garush Melkonyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b01af4c4904800ff852d8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4160569,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Garush Melkonyan","original_name":"Garush Melkonyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b01b00c49048011c2f884b","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4160575,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Simón García-Miñaúr","original_name":"Simón García-Miñaúr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b01b27c4904800c506f7af","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":4160575,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Simón García-Miñaúr","original_name":"Simón García-Miñaúr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b01b348a0e9b00e376c399","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4160600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luska Khalapyan","original_name":"Luska Khalapyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b01b52e24b935b2f4dabed","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
