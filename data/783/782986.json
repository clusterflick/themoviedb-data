Soon, one of the largest complex of dams ever conceived will be completed on the Narmada. A social struggle is getting organized. We travel on the river until the ocean, on our way to meet inhabitants, beliefs, and convictions that cohabit and are brought into conflict as this valley undergoes major transformations.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/yosoSKt9LKfOhRgk5m1XbYTI9X1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Narmada","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2202028,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Grégory Cohen","original_name":"Grégory Cohen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff3678b1d3563003f0ed7fb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2023515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manon Ott","original_name":"Manon Ott","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff36795fab3fa003a7749dc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599038,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jocelyn Robert","original_name":"Jocelyn Robert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff3675bf794ad003c74ef79","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2023515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manon Ott","original_name":"Manon Ott","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff3673331d09b003e601fed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1097254,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mathias Bouffier","original_name":"Mathias Bouffier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff3677d414291003f53b418","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2923234,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Céline Loiseau","original_name":"Céline Loiseau","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/wK2AACEotRPLA7FuJgx5hMDJDL3.jpg","credit_id":"5ff367ca99d5c3003fcfb84a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2202028,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Grégory Cohen","original_name":"Grégory Cohen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff36744f794ad003c74ef63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2567364","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.757,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yosoSKt9LKfOhRgk5m1XbYTI9X1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":775}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
