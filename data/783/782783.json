At the outbreak of war, Hitler authorizes a programme of mass-murder targeting the nation's disabled people, transporting them from institutions to killing centres. Elise is a patient who sweeps the institution. She doesn't speak and staff assume she doesn't understand. But she watches everything. She watches buses full of patients leave and return empty. When it's her turn, she knows what's in store. Incarcerated, what hope can there be? Based on real events, this is the story of one woman's resistance, in the only way she could.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":146765,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roaring Girl Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resistance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922401,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liz Crow","original_name":"Liz Crow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff27fd5f794ad003c735d4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1434445","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
