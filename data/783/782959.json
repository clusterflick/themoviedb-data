Young Yazidi women were separated from the old and taken to the Galaxy Cinema in Mosul. There they were paraded, selected, enslaved, tortured and systematically raped. Some were only 11 years old. Young Yazidi women were separated from the old and taken to the Galaxy Cinema in Mosul. There they were paraded, selected, enslaved, tortured and systematically raped. Some were only 11 years old. Yazidis, including the female victims, believe that sexual contact with a non-Yazidi, even through rape, results in a loss of Yazidi identity. The film asks what it means to be a survivor of genocidal violence and slavery in 2016. How does one restore the girlsâ€™ dignity and help them heal? How do the women get justice for these heinous crimes? The film delves into the lives of the young Yazidi women. This is their story.","popularity":0.3642,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Was a Yazidi Slave","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Jag var sexslav hos IS","type":"TV Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2923086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Evans","original_name":"David Evans","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff34f91414291003e53c5ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Evans","original_name":"David Evans","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff34f9bca7ec6003eb417d6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532097,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eric Trometer","original_name":"Eric Trometer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff34fb0fbe36f0041f86e12","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9359428","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13015,"name":"terrorism"},{"id":220991,"name":"isis (daesh)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
