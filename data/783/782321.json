It's about the word “lesbian”, and the decades of toxic connotations that have made it feel like a hostile piece of language: so much so that today, many queer women hesitate before using it. Rosemary Baker's short film of the poem, which features a cast of real queer women, uses intricate body painting to bring to life what those layers of toxicity feel like. In an era of headline-hitting attacks on lesbians in public, it is a call to arms to take the word back.","popularity":0.1369,"poster_path":"/iXk4BgsERaPOSE9bNlyMmqvTLt3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lesbian.","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2920615,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosemary Baker","original_name":"Rosemary Baker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff0ce500c4c16003fa34fac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/iXk4BgsERaPOSE9bNlyMmqvTLt3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
