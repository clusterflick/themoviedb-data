P. Fippany loses his home and takes to the road on a chicken-wagon with his wife and daughter. The wagon is wrecked in an automobile collision involving Jimmy Pickett, who falls in love with daughter Aida, and through a misunderstanding involving Marseillaise, Fippany's racehorse, his wife Josephine and Aida go to live with relatives. The disconsolate Fippany sells Marseillaise to Jimmy's father, sends the money to his wife, then disappears. Meanwhile, Jimmy finds Aida and convinces her of his love. Marseillaise, badly driven in a race, loses a heat, but Fippany emerges and rides her to victory, following which there is a reconciliation between husband and wife.","popularity":0.4368,"poster_path":"/9BeyD0fdbpKZuy6dQo0J7jM2fEp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dixie Merchant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mulhall","original_name":"Jack Mulhall","popularity":0.3,"profile_path":"/4r33PICmACJZ2Bjum0v1EkvOxbx.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Jimmy Pickett","credit_id":"66bc31c40ef9b5d5b06658af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madge Bellamy","original_name":"Madge Bellamy","popularity":0.2701,"profile_path":"/wiUNtLSEuorsYdhWAzct1W5nIB3.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Aida Fippany","credit_id":"66bc31d491d068a72071c01e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
