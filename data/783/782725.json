Gavito was one of the bilateral investigators who \"broke\" the case of missing rich kid Mark Kilroy (\"Phil\" in the feature and \"John\" in this short) sensationalized by Geraldo Rivera at the time. This brief documentary uses archival news, police photos and videotape to prove the truth of the crimes is even stranger than the fictionalized feature film.","popularity":0.3737,"poster_path":"/wzyFqtCi3C1MRoZF4cKmPYCAQYe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1632,"logo_path":"/cisLn1YAUuptXVBa0xjq7ST9cH0.png","name":"Lionsgate","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rituales de Sangre: The True Story Behind the Matamoros Cult Killings","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Aldrete","original_name":"Sara Aldrete","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ff245f87aecc6003ffcfbd6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolfo Constanzo","original_name":"Adolfo Constanzo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ff2460c1ad93b003f21616c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Gavito","original_name":"George Gavito","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ff2461f1d3563003e0d9361","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":139198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javier Rivas","original_name":"Javier Rivas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Photographer","credit_id":"5ff24711869e75003edb7624","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":74631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zev Berman","original_name":"Zev Berman","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff246a566e469003ec17812","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1394143,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Atkinson","original_name":"Mark Atkinson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff246d21ad93b003d215bfe","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51030,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Block","original_name":"Peter Block","popularity":0.0909,"profile_path":"/b2CXFVKa0nUvp3sF6h5qYiYmWD.jpg","credit_id":"5ff246f44d0e8d003b9fd472","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1870983,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Miguel Casillas","original_name":"Miguel Casillas","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff247300c4c16003da5ae31","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2237653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelly Pancho","original_name":"Kelly Pancho","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff2474ad2f5b500402e1b5e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922165,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jonah Walker","original_name":"Jonah Walker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff24779869e75003edb76db","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2922167,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tom Lathrop","original_name":"Tom Lathrop","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff2479c1fb94f0041f6d65e","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053124,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Mayne","original_name":"Paul Mayne","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff247be0c4c16003ea53a72","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2606629,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fernando Romay","original_name":"Fernando Romay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff247e1470ead0041faa50e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1384787","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1430,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wzyFqtCi3C1MRoZF4cKmPYCAQYe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2008-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
