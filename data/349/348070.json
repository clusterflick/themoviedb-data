In the lawless town of Brimstone, the citizens are being terrorized by a gang of outlaws headed by Mason (Tom London), who, to no one's great surprise, proves to be the very man Jack has been trailing. The relieved citizens of Brimstone then elect Jack as their new sheriff. The murdered ranger's sister was played by Margaret Roach, the 19-year-old daughter of comedy producer Hal Roach. Ernie Adams replaced Glenn Strange (who himself had replaced Frank Yaconelli) as Randall's sidekick, Manny, and Nelson McDowell provided additional comic relief as Brimstone's busy undertaker.","popularity":0.8125,"poster_path":"/240COskZHgBgBbqPJKvlgIsnbDA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monogram Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1940-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Riders from Nowhere","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1020132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Randall","original_name":"Jack Randall","popularity":0.141,"profile_path":"/pNnWgl8h0cK4JeSq18yRzTD8A5o.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jack Rankin (as Jack Randall)","credit_id":"559ebc3cc3a368080e001e5b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":954506,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Roach","original_name":"Margaret Roach","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Marian Adams","credit_id":"559ebc65c3a368080e001e60","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernie Adams","original_name":"Ernie Adams","popularity":0.138,"profile_path":"/zpKSSdsuDVofN1GAAbKnkn2GjrL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Manny","credit_id":"559ebc6ec3a3680820001edf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom London","original_name":"Tom London","popularity":0.2025,"profile_path":"/nfLW8J3AMasTu1Ahm0HftRgx9qy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mason","credit_id":"559ebc77c3a3680819001e2a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles King","original_name":"Charles King","popularity":0.5341,"profile_path":"/1K3oq1VI6wEcv2lxI2BpoNFu6bW.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Trigger","credit_id":"559ebc889251412db2001e45","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelson McDowell","original_name":"Nelson McDowell","popularity":0.0992,"profile_path":"/c9WodDYcxUL0P5X1zq1DVgJXogG.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Undertaker","credit_id":"559ebc90c3a3680810001fc2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Chesebro","original_name":"George Chesebro","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":"/s8A5WerpnAjIom4ezjiTEcDEOc4.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Bart","credit_id":"559ebc98c3a368080e001e66","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":927616,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Vernon","original_name":"Dorothy Vernon","popularity":0.2421,"profile_path":"/umAgzGIOdNfS4SpeUXLopAAm8oe.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mrs. Gregory","credit_id":"559ebca2c3a3680820001eec","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485789,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Richard D.
