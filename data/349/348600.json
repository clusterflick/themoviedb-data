Magali's problem comes from the fact that she is so bland and unassuming as to be nearly invisible. Her passivity and inability to form her own opinions grates on her husband Alain, a go-getter radio journalist, and he plans to take a year long assignment in Canada to get away from her. While preparing to leave, his boss, who has been inadvertently led to believe that Magli is pregnant, shows up and tells Alain. The husband's first response is to demand an abortion, but on second thought he decides he would like to become a father after all. Magli, fearing that he will leave, then devises her elaborate ruse.","popularity":0.1238,"poster_path":"/hgXXVB9Bq6u4FkpHkXpPY4d5w8B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sinon, oui","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Mendez","original_name":"Catherine Mendez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55a3dbe892514129710057c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmanuel Clarke","original_name":"Emmanuel Clarke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55a3dbefc3a3681ce3005bb3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lou Castel","original_name":"Lou Castel","popularity":0.2176,"profile_path":"/nfSbW6awANxaRI769Bo2ZLDb22P.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"55a3dbf8c3a3681cf0005bc4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1486962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnès Regolo","original_name":"Agnès Regolo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/mlgWTllGLsPw8Cx3XL3WXCPNjDB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"55a3dc01c3a3681cfa005114","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claire Simon","original_name":"Claire Simon","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/eN0t1PF8o2eCmRWJQme6KIBdSde.jpg","credit_id":"55aedccc92514125da00b285","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":56211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claire Simon","original_name":"Claire Simon","popularity":0.0965,"profile_path":"/eN0t1PF8o2eCmRWJQme6KIBdSde.jpg","credit_id":"55aedcbd9251411e0600b32d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0120124","wikidata_id":"Q3485039","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1652,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hgXXVB9Bq6u4FkpHkXpPY4d5w8B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1101}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
