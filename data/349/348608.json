After releasing a series of award winning solo albums, Verlaine was hailed by The New York Times in 1996 as, \"a visionary artist with his creativity and energy undimmed.\" As composer, producer, singer and sideman, Rip has collaborated with such music legends as Jerry Lee Lewis, Mick Jagger and Deborah Harry.
