Spyball tells the extraordinary story of Berg, a linguist/Ivy-educated lawyer/.243 lifetime hitter whom manager Casey Stengel called “the strangest man to ever play the game of baseball.” Berg walked in eclectic circles, counting Babe Ruth, Albert Einstein, and the Marx Brothers among his friends, but it was his service to his country that truly distinguished him. His surreptitious filming of Tokyo during a 1934 baseball tour helped develop strategies for the eventual bombing of the city during World War II, and his cloak-and-dagger mind games involving a German scientist helped prove that the Nazis were failing in their attempts to develop an atomic bomb.","popularity":0.0946,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spyball","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2239464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Lee","original_name":"Bill Lee","popularity":0.0513,"profile_path":"/lbNlqmhDwQXxkO28XjtVW4FVIop.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5c6090e9c3a3684fa4d4a00a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2239465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moe Berg","original_name":"Moe Berg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c6090fc0e0a267de694c024","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christina Burchard","original_name":"Christina Burchard","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559ff7be9251414082000388","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1827207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Newman","original_name":"Daniel Newman","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5930a27692514115f3000916","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
