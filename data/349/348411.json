In their youth, they had a brief, passionate affair in Australia. Since then they have lost sight of each other, but never forgotten each other. Now that they have found each other again, their feelings for each other flare up again. Anna and Peter decide to see each other again. But disaster is brewing in Anna's family. The very young Evita suddenly appears at Anna's mother Louisa Holmes' house. She is the daughter of Louisa's husband Ernest and his young mistress. Shocked by this encounter, Louisa has a car accident and has to be nursed because of her injuries. Her son Winston, Anna's younger brother and \"mummy's boy\", takes care of everything - as always. But Anna also has to lend a hand, because her mother lives alone on a large estate. This leaves her little time for Peter.","popularity":0.3599,"poster_path":"/wvUwq8Btiu5J90HEo1AzbcHRRTK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosamunde Pilcher: Evitas Rache","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Fulton-Smith","original_name":"Francis Fulton-Smith","popularity":0.3812,"profile_path":"/r7LNiLxjmGPmF6VgrRenMCo2CKy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Peter Morisson","credit_id":"55a26b78925141297d003612","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":234090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Lanz","original_name":"Elisabeth Lanz","popularity":0.5476,"profile_path":"/nV5bLrZWOibkUPChIagcxcjriEg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Anna Williams","credit_id":"55a26b87c3a3681cf30036d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniela Ziegler","original_name":"Daniela Ziegler","popularity":0.1703,"profile_path":"/f9yMtpUguv3CLX8XcPozstzxY0Q.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Louisa Holmes","credit_id":"55a26bae925141296b00341f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Limpinsel","original_name":"Thomas Limpinsel","popularity":0.1668,"profile_path":"/dUKu1rCOYLXLqVuQyE6kM2GSVxr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Winston Holmes","credit_id":"5feb37605ff34e0040fd16af","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1148333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jasmin Gassmann","original_name":"Jasmin Gassmann","popularity":0.5318,"profile_path":"/1xV0NbL1CDXmt8g0hs94uTlmMwM.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Evita Ferreira","credit_id":"5feb377307a808003f9175bb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander-Klaus Stecher","original_name":"Alexander-Klaus Stecher","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Kommissar Hinchley","credit_id":"55a26b95925141298000353a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Davidson","original_name":"Stuart Davidson","popularity":0.4322,"profile_path":"/Wti4IHoN7Dl207OzQtDAqry9Wa.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Press Photographer","credit_id":"5e922df88e87020014cb007a","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Kabisch","original_name":"Christine Kabisch","popularity":0.0751,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55a26b4dc3a3681cfa0031a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":146744,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gabriele Kister","original_name":"Gabriele Kister","popularity":0.0824,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5feb373a5ff34e003ffd1ed5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3132252","wikidata_id":"Q79385045","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/a9rPFzfuZGDxBER6dfY6AOtXxxP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/wvUwq8Btiu5J90HEo1AzbcHRRTK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1706},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/1g9DuFSvRzku1gsrzpEnOppV59a.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
