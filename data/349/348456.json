Beth sings both classic and original songs. We visit the Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo where bull riders and wild bronco busters match their skills against 1500-pound bulls and wild, bucking horses. We visit Bridger, a 7-year-old cowboy, and his pony Mabel. See amazing trick riders, crack a bullwhip, tame a wild horse, and meet Max Reynolds, a world-class trick roper. All this against backdrops of blue skies, misty mountains, and the golden prairie. Kids will learn, laugh, and want more. Grown-ups, too. Parents' Choice award-winner and chosen by Parenting Magazine as one of the top kid videos of the year.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All About Cowboys For Kids Part 1","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
