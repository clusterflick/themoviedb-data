Never seen in her lifetime, they were found by chance in a Chicago storage locker and auctioned off cheaply.  Now Vivian Maier has gone viral and her magical pictures sell for thousands of dollars. Vivian was a tough street photographer, a secret poet of suburbia. In life she was a recluse, a hoarder, spinning tall tales about her French roots. Presented by Alan Yentob, the film includes stories from those who knew her and those who revealed her astonishing work.","popularity":0.18,"poster_path":"/e8QtjA5tL9U7kSY0ZwTTVsFZuw5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vivian Maier: Who Took Nanny's Pictures?","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Yentob","original_name":"Alan Yentob","popularity":0.4371,"profile_path":"/cE1TVynSWTO2iPcVcNwWNZt3wbN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d351fcc2f8d097bccd53c54","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1899368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Maier","original_name":"Vivian Maier","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archival)","credit_id":"67534d84871a42c9c245432b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jill Nicholls","original_name":"Jill Nicholls","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d351e792f8d097bccd53955","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2997754","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2065,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fSCN6hsE1bli1NMFPjL0yln8okm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3671},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2065,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AgxIHU6ucszLK97gYMTBAL6m1ix.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3671},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2065,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lDQVMqwXWITwN9c7hdnsmj1xECG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3671}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e8QtjA5tL9U7kSY0ZwTTVsFZuw5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
