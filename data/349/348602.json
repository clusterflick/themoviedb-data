Actually, Maxwell and two henchmen had poured acid on the brake lines, causing the car to crash. Genevieve, daughter of the Mountie chief, suspects Maxwell and Thomas Hatch, president of the bank shipping the gold, but she quickly becomes more trouble than help to Sergeant Renfrew in charge of the investigation. Renfrew and Constable Kelly drive the next shipment but Maxwell plans to make them crash the same way as Hill did. Renfrew steers the vehicle into a hillside and this gives him an idea of what happened to the other car.","popularity":1.1223,"poster_path":"/qfRSn945VZbsTCuYn6BPEkx2Klf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10755,"logo_path":null,"name":"Criterion Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1940-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE REDCOATS ARE COMING!","title":"Danger Ahead","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Newill","original_name":"James Newill","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/CMf8yLvmxPLM1HhvN0Pb4Y4vpW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"RCMP Sgt.
