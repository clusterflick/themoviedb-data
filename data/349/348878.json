By exploring the repercussions of this act, Daisy and her mother embark on a fascinating and emotional adventure in social and sexual morality. Her grandmother, compelled to run away to have her baby in secret, handed the child over to 'the nuns'. Daisy's mum was eventually adopted by English Catholics from Stoke-on-Trent. Her grandmother returned to Ireland and told no-one. The father remained a mystery for another 60 years, until Daisy and her mum decided it was time to find out who he was.  Their attempts to find the truth make raw the fear and shame that Catholicism has wrought on the Irish psyche for centuries. It leads Daisy and her mum to connect with a brand new family living an extraordinarily different life.","popularity":0.5502,"poster_path":"/zDnHNIxp8Mrng0lMHRCzraYTFBn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roads Entertainment","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2015-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After the Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"My Mother the Secret Baby","type":"TV title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1344495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daisy Asquith","original_name":"Daisy Asquith","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/zzXQRX4038yD2UzHJPr3otWY8ek.jpg","credit_id":"55a6517192514109ab0011b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1777284,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oisin Lunny","original_name":"Oisin Lunny","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f19b999251412fc7001552","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1344495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daisy Asquith","original_name":"Daisy Asquith","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/zzXQRX4038yD2UzHJPr3otWY8ek.jpg","credit_id":"58f19ba0c3a3682ede001494","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143864,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alan Maher","original_name":"Alan Maher","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f19e30c3a3682e3f0017a0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1796438,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Doireann de Buitléar","original_name":"Doireann de Buitléar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f19e4cc3a3682eb6001877","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84378,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick Fraser","original_name":"Nick Fraser","popularity":0.1026,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f19e6c9251412fb9001802","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62181,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rory Gilmartin","original_name":"Rory Gilmartin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f19e7ec3a3682e3f0017f0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321751,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kate Townsend","original_name":"Kate Townsend","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f19e889251412fc70017ce","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274583,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alan Mackay","original_name":"Alan Mackay","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58f19e93c3a3682ea700177f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jnZ01GRSzXiupDyLKargANbup7f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zDnHNIxp8Mrng0lMHRCzraYTFBn.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cXEUyuhDeGW6WrB5GK3N6nRgCoP.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2393,"name":"adoption"},{"id":2421,"name":"social control"},{"id":6625,"name":"family secrets"},{"id":14985,"name":"ireland"},{"id":161207,"name":"catholicism"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":188720,"name":"shame"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Dublin Film Festival","release_date":"2015-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
