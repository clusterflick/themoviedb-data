From national icons like Gardel, Evita, Che, and Maradona the film dialogs with recent Argentine history and it does so with extraordinary energy, supported by a rarely seen use of all kinds of archive material in an almost Dionysian state of sampleadelia. The film arrives to a surprising reflection on nationalism, demagogic governments and delusions of unanimity; problems that are common to emerging societies that cannot find their ways to a freer and more egalitarian society.","popularity":0.5953,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Olympus vacuum","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486463,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolina Azzi, Pablo Racioppi","original_name":"Carolina Azzi, Pablo Racioppi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Directors","credit_id":"55a1fcb99251412977002ab2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan José Sebreli","original_name":"Juan José Sebreli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"55a1fce3c3a3681cde00298d","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2806550","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":430,"name":"venezuela"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":10596,"name":"argentina"},{"id":13042,"name":"football (soccer)"},{"id":33852,"name":"falklands war"},{"id":33860,"name":"falklands"},{"id":165716,"name":"perónism"},{"id":173644,"name":"communism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"BAFICI","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
