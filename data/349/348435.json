They attacked the village of Columbus. At the same time a baby was born in Nazas, Durango. He was the son of General Pancho Villa. When his father was murdered by the government in 1923, his mother took him to California and told him: Never tell anybody who your father was, because your life and mine are in danger. Eighty three years later, Ernesto Nava came to his father´s land and discovered that General Villa is one of the most respected heroes in his country and a moral guide for millions of peasants throughout Mexico. The story of Pancho Villa told by those who knew him.","popularity":0.0655,"poster_path":"/waOo5hCdVao6oZqRtjUZxRouaj1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2006-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pancho Villa: Revolution Is Not Over","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anacleto Rentería Díaz","original_name":"Anacleto Rentería Díaz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55a2b2dc925141296e003c4a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pablo López","original_name":"Pablo López","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55a2b2e79251412977003a2d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diego Zapata","original_name":"Diego Zapata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"55a2b2ef925141296e003c52","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana María Zapata","original_name":"Ana María Zapata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"55a2b2f7c3a3681cf3003bcb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernesto Nava","original_name":"Ernesto Nava","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"55a2b3059251412971003a20","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francesco Taboada Tabone","original_name":"Francesco Taboada Tabone","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55a2b2bfc3a3681cec0035c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francesco Taboada Tabone","original_name":"Francesco Taboada Tabone","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55a2b2c79251412977003a29","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0783765","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/waOo5hCdVao6oZqRtjUZxRouaj1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2006-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
