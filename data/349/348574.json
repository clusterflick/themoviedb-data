Jump ahead ten years: the dad is dead, the mom is gone, and the son, Luke, is raising his now grown sister, Annie. He's overprotective, and she seems blood simple, a coquette and an innocent. He runs the diner in town, and one day, Lisa, a callow writer-to-be, comes through from Manhattan, keeping a journal, looking for interesting people. She takes a shine to Annie and then to the muscular and well-read Luke. But what is their secret, how many of the townsfolk are in on it, and what will Lisa do when it all becomes clear?","popularity":0.7295,"poster_path":"/7RxFvdeTEIYW1cvVaIzJp1KnjW5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58073,"logo_path":null,"name":"JLM Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Annie's Garden","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Coulouris","original_name":"Keith Coulouris","popularity":0.2098,"profile_path":"/piSn2zcFxIZmjV7n6hvAdfj5aqa.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Luke Thomas","credit_id":"55a3af789251412977005309","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yancy Butler","original_name":"Yancy Butler","popularity":0.9015,"profile_path":"/z4IbPBVF4GHJq7IWdLQg71zRcyd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lisa Miller","credit_id":"55a3af95c3a3681cde0050fc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Chatton","original_name":"Charlotte Chatton","popularity":0.1203,"profile_path":"/vhV0qc6leXokgUo0DnkpKYJIeCR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Annie Thomas","credit_id":"55a3afb492514129740055a7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Zabriskie","original_name":"Grace Zabriskie","popularity":0.7056,"profile_path":"/19tr5IbzCmv4x5B3WFlG1RQPwXu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Barnes","credit_id":"55a3afd1c3a3681ce30057b0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Coulouris","original_name":"Keith Coulouris","popularity":0.2098,"profile_path":"/piSn2zcFxIZmjV7n6hvAdfj5aqa.jpg","credit_id":"55a3b0119251412977005316","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":585950,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jordan Leibert","original_name":"Jordan Leibert","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ba9d11e72fe80040d9f1f0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42625,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruce Langhorne","original_name":"Bruce Langhorne","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ba9d246a300b00977c17a8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":550894,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joseph Montgomery","original_name":"Joseph Montgomery","popularity":0.1261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ba9d2e6a300b00451a5d9f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":43747,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tony Miller","original_name":"Tony Miller","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ba9d365ad76b009d0a35f5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123910,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Barnao","original_name":"Anthony Barnao","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58271cc39251417b2101a3c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0109136","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.595,"height":977,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7RxFvdeTEIYW1cvVaIzJp1KnjW5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":581}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
