Life was never meant to turn out like this. Ten years ago Jennie was a fairly well known singer/songwriter in the local music scene. Now she is the mother of a two year old girl, the wife of an unemployed depressed husband and a barmaid behind the bars she used to play in. When a guitarist from her past takes an interest in her; both musically and physically, Jennie sees a way to relive her past and the potential for a better future. As one relationship blossoms, the other unravels racing towards a climax that will ultimately define the rest of her life.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Take It Back and Start All Over","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3405172","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
