It's New York City, with 29 shopping days left until Christmas, and they're in love. Or are they? Their romance has been on-again, off-again because David can't bring himself to say, \"I love you.\" He can say it in French, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, but not English. So, when she learns at an inopportune time that he's applied for a job in Ho Chi Minh City, she asks for breathing room until Christmas; the film chronicles the ensuing days of restless indecision.","popularity":1.485,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1002,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eureka Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A comedy for the romantically hopeless","title":"Breathing Room","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Floyd","original_name":"Susan Floyd","popularity":0.4568,"profile_path":"/4Y4ruSrowtMo7QVxHEULP3ErILc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kathy","credit_id":"559f57e99251412daf0038f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":167604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadia Dajani","original_name":"Nadia Dajani","popularity":0.333,"profile_path":"/kpmBP0s5GRys5aNVjM0daShXFFa.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Claire","credit_id":"559f5871c3a3680814003621","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Futterman","original_name":"Dan Futterman","popularity":0.5641,"profile_path":"/dgmPcQe3tf616zB5hDpDStFunxO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"David","credit_id":"559f57fb9251412dc0003a5c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1466166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Chenevert","original_name":"Michael Chenevert","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":"/8pfIWOXKeK6OD3ZCc436bjbnxmr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Korean Market Patron #3","credit_id":"559f58439251412da9003ad3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":139703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Angela","original_name":"Sharon Angela","popularity":0.4657,"profile_path":"/hKeENflE9HktZMKr5yJibzwHVbW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Additional Patron","credit_id":"559f5852c3a368081900393a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":171334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Hohn","original_name":"Amy Hohn","popularity":0.1458,"profile_path":"/wWYcjiDCbBiVkNlTzKQvQy1w3D4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Cousin Judy","credit_id":"559f58619251412db20039f9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saverio Guerra","original_name":"Saverio Guerra","popularity":0.3491,"profile_path":"/liaGk1K3ZdJFkXUUvGEkMdDhz3n.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Tony","credit_id":"559f587f9251412db20039fe","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":186758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Sherman","original_name":"Jon Sherman","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559f5767c3a368081d0040bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1485911,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tom Hughes","original_name":"Tom Hughes","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559f57a69251412da9003ab8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0115754","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"R","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
