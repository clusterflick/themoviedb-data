Gabriel, who was more widely known as the “Mountain Hawk,” led  an outlaw’s life which was either that of a lowly criminal or daring  do-gooder, as accounts of the man’s life vary depending on the  point of view of the interviewee. As Rosendo digs deeper for the  truth, it becomes apparent that Gabriel was a heroic figure worthy  of the song his brother plans to write in his commemoration—if only  Rosendo can overcome his growing envy for his brother’s immortal  status as a swashbuckling rebel.","popularity":0.1315,"poster_path":"/hHqqNDVT60h69duGm0ofX115ROg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2002-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El gavilán de la sierra","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":229098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillermo Larrea","original_name":"Guillermo Larrea","popularity":0.1239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"559e3dc4c3a368081900105e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":940850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Goytia","original_name":"Claudia Goytia","popularity":0.1137,"profile_path":"/cs3FYm9vMVgyaEaO1BwuPCZCNI7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"559e3dcdc3a3680825000f55","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Almada","original_name":"Mario Almada","popularity":0.5083,"profile_path":"/pj2KsxvhvCoKcy5rgmX7hS1IKhH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"559e3dd39251412dac00117e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abel Woolrich","original_name":"Abel Woolrich","popularity":0.2458,"profile_path":"/1kUo72m2u9RTWqzLJML8ZjnE1B3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"559e3dd7c3a368081d001362","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1449761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Ángel Esparza","original_name":"Juan Ángel Esparza","popularity":0.1519,"profile_path":"/3BrHBXwDSdaMrMB6ua0AQdT43DF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"559e3de39251412dc00010ed","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Antonio de la Riva","original_name":"Juan Antonio de la Riva","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/vx0eFwuI0SOBOKR8z6XbkxRWcqq.jpg","credit_id":"559e3dabc3a368081d001356","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Antonio de la Riva","original_name":"Juan Antonio de la Riva","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/vx0eFwuI0SOBOKR8z6XbkxRWcqq.jpg","credit_id":"559e3db29251412dac00117b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201488,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mario Martínez Cobos","original_name":"Mario Martínez Cobos","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/nKTUQ76E1SkO2ZqKHPRYvbNVuhi.jpg","credit_id":"6343a0179c97bd00903adec0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0312716","wikidata_id":"Q21132704","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hHqqNDVT60h69duGm0ofX115ROg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
