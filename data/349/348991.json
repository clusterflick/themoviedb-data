Before the concert songs kick in, this set begins with a studio recording of a previously unreleased song, \"Aime\", exclusive to this album. The rest of the concert recordings feature repertoire from Fabian's 2005 album \"9\" and the other older songs that pre-date the \"9\" song are all performed acoustically. Some had to be entirely reworked to fit the concept of this live show. In addition, Fabian delivers a tribute to her idol Barbra Streisand by performing \"Papa Can You Hear Me\" and \"A Piece of Sky\", both from the soundtrack of Streisand's film tour de force
