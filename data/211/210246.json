Trouble is, he can’t help wondering whether there’s more to life. So Tom sets off on the ultimate adventure: cycling around the world.  Despite his lack of experience, Tom cycles and camps his way across three continents, encountering a vivid cast of friends and foes. But the journey takes an unlikely detour when he falls in love with Tenny, a feisty Iranian-Armenian. When her parents forbid her from taking to the open road, Tom is faced with the ultimate dilemma: stay with Tenny or continue his adventure alone?  Janapar – named after the Armenian word for journey – is an honest and life-affirming tale of finding what you’re looking for when you least expect it.","popularity":0.0955,"poster_path":"/uDRZPdHIe3I0mWNObCEkBR7QiZx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DJ","name":"Djibouti"},{"iso_3166_1":"ET","name":"Ethiopia"},{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"},{"iso_3166_1":"OM","name":"Oman"},{"iso_3166_1":"SD","name":"Sudan"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"YE","name":"Yemen"}],"release_date":"2012-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love on a bike","title":"Janapar","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534733,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Allen","original_name":"Tom Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e72ae05b1f68d0014ddfab2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2576037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tenny Adamian","original_name":"Tenny Adamian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5e789380357c000013525942","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2576038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Welch","original_name":"Andrew Welch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e78939e2f3b17001153dd1d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2576040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Maultby","original_name":"Mark Maultby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e7893b62f3b170017536a70","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1620326,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vincent Watts","original_name":"Vincent Watts","popularity":0.0611,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e789336357c000011535760","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1620326,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vincent Watts","original_name":"Vincent Watts","popularity":0.0611,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7893df2f3b170014536b69","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534733,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Allen","original_name":"Tom Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7892dd357c00001651f352","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2093261,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Wheat","original_name":"Richard Wheat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7893132f3b170019549a2d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1389687,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stephen Goldsmith","original_name":"Stephen Goldsmith","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7893cbcabfe4001324bd8f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2042732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James W Newton","original_name":"James W Newton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e7892ed357c000011535684","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534733,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Allen","original_name":"Tom Allen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e72add72f3b1700114aba29","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2042732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James W Newton","original_name":"James W Newton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e72aded8de0ae001557b406","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2124818","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uDRZPdHIe3I0mWNObCEkBR7QiZx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Raindance)","release_date":"2012-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
