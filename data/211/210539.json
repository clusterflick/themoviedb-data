The album was recorded in a barn in rural Oregon. Pendarvia is heavily driven by the natural surroundings of the area, inter-cutting music with beautiful shots of the surrounding scenery. The film follows the abstractly linear narrative of the recording process, inter-cutting found moments of dialogue from the band, producer Tucker Martine, collaborators and friends. The film is a beautiful audio/visual collage that explores the trials and tribulations of the creative process.","popularity":0.0824,"poster_path":"/2ZVV4iB7F56jGb31BvbxZTcRJoZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15813,"logo_path":"/dfPPIWH8syLWPv6zQi2NPPLAS7C.png","name":"Wieden+Kennedy Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pendarvia","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1194154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenny Conlee","original_name":"Jenny Conlee","popularity":0.135,"profile_path":"/6P2CymYe5b647bUV1LP5uYNsFeq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4d7ec3a368484e1ec501","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Funk","original_name":"Chris Funk","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d7ec3a368484e1ec505","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tucker Martine","original_name":"Tucker Martine","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d7ec3a368484e1ec509","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Meloy","original_name":"Colin Meloy","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":"/lNNaQMLtzDt9YJ7gHGviiDhpsPe.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d7ec3a368484e1ec50d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Moen","original_name":"John Moen","popularity":0.0761,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d7ec3a368484e1ec511","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nate Query","original_name":"Nate Query","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4d7ec3a368484e1ec515","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97524,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Rose","original_name":"Aaron Rose","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d7ec3a368484e1ec4fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1806993","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2ZVV4iB7F56jGb31BvbxZTcRJoZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":657}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
