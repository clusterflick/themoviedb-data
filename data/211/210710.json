This is a story about teenagers fighting their way out of the 'hood, armed with little more than a basketball and the hard wisdom of a fierce, demanding coach. For 35 years, Hurley has led St. Anthony his way. He's an uncompromising teacher who demands perfection from kids who've known little discipline growing up on the streets of Jersey City. His methodical, yet volatile style works miracles.","popularity":0.0606,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Street Stops Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194389,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Shaw","original_name":"Kevin Shaw","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d83c3a368484e1ed399","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1162126","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
