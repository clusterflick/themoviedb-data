Krzysztof Krauze's biopic My Nikifor travels to the tail end of Krynicki's (Krystyna Feldman) life journey, dramatizing the period that surrounded his interaction with the well-established artist Marian Wlosinski (Roman Gancarczyk).","popularity":0.5429,"poster_path":"/9hrc3d96gwuiPNO6BEgR5KtVShY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":250,"logo_path":"/evWKasiElVQywuKv2dI72P9twz8.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":6480,"logo_path":"/qJUUNzFYXNUDaisssBTV3Zdki9R.png","name":"TVP","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":20792,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio
