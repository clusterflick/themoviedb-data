In 1998 they won their unmatched sixth NBA title of the '90s. But this was not the same team that squashed all opponents that stood before them, united and led magnificently by players such as Scottie Pippen and the irresistible Michael Jordan. At the beginning of the 1998 season, this team was anything but united. His Airness was still His Airness, but the rest of the Bulls looked less than a shadow of their selves. Pippen stood injured on the sidelines demanding a trade, Rodman looked more interested in Hollywood and his hair, and the supporting cast were beginning to look extremely vulnerable. But as with all great teams, they dusted themselves off, wiped away the cobwebs (not to mention the odd ego or two), and played out the final two-thirds of the regular season like the Chicago Bulls of old.","popularity":0.6803,"poster_path":"/yeLoJWZEuWDKSEzusSe28KsXflj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4396,"logo_path":"/g76GCLOncS4SKIYfhWT70Zo4ypv.png","name":"NBA Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":2161,"logo_path":"/kaHPCUD2nQ1DGWDAH3zbYVCkTae.png","name":"CBS Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unforgettabulls: The 6th NBA Championship Season of the Chicago Bulls","video":true,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Jordan","original_name":"Michael Jordan","popularity":1.8809,"profile_path":"/tCqjwlROe98wYbcRhCcp3qYsUc5.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4d7fc3a368484e1ec7b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scottie Pippen","original_name":"Scottie Pippen","popularity":0.4308,"profile_path":"/uBzeHR11hd67PpcW7btIsfOf65n.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4d7fc3a368484e1ec7bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1177525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Jackson","original_name":"Phil Jackson","popularity":0.2187,"profile_path":"/tpeWFZsOhKLYEOtswSwQHdbtJ6x.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4d7fc3a368484e1ec7bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Rodman","original_name":"Dennis Rodman","popularity":0.7467,"profile_path":"/tIYGMFJvBZ30HY3KlVQ0evoaEKV.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ec7de1a8e2e003dd6125fb2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1533747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Kerr","original_name":"Steve Kerr","popularity":0.2479,"profile_path":"/7hrMDyMecFJKNNQb7ToIEqDQ3ts.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ec7de1ed2147c0022ba5fb5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1837077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Kukoč","original_name":"Toni Kukoč","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ec7de24e635710022cfb088","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2582450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Harper","original_name":"Ron Harper","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ec7de29d2147c0022ba5fc2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2617214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luc Longley","original_name":"Luc Longley","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ec7de2f0fb17f001d7c9420","order":7}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yeLoJWZEuWDKSEzusSe28KsXflj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":520,"name":"chicago, illinois"},{"id":6075,"name":"sports"},{"id":169055,"name":"national basketball association (nba)"},{"id":315170,"name":"chicago bulls"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
