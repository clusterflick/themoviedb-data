The film consists of interlocking stories lines- the first about two trans women in a pandrogynous relationship in which they simultaneously receive plastic surgery treatments to mirror each other's features to ideally form into a single person.  The second story follows a trans man and his new (cisgender) boyfriend as they run away from home and push against their own personal boundaries while dealing with his unexpected pregnancy.","popularity":0.9121,"poster_path":"/nAr8MP3Ls2qbm6DohpIJJtJwTcm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130643,"logo_path":null,"name":"Narrative
