But his decision to accept a six-month research post in the Antarctic, making the first detailed study of a penguin colony, changes all that...  Living in Shackleton’s derelict hut, Forbush is alone at the frozen edge of the world, his only links to civilisation a two-way radio and letters to his elusive, would-be girlfriend, Tara, in London. Through an often ferocious winter in the company of the penguins, he grows increasingly attached to his hardy, endearing subjects – learning profound lessons in endurance and humility.","popularity":1.6858,"poster_path":"/9lLGpolDp6NOB5BTSMm3HU0ZI0W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":538,"logo_path":"/oGpxL5lFf8VpWsAQ6tut0on25LW.png","name":"EMI
