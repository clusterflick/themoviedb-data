But beside these scenes of glorious misrule gathers a nationwide rebellion led by the Duke of Northumberland and his charismatic son, Hotspur. The first installment of Shakespeare's gripping account of the rise of Hal from idle barfly to monarch-in-waiting combines compelling power politics with the hilarious antics of Falstaff, Shakespeare's greatest comic creation.","popularity":1.466,"poster_path":"/en4wPjHBPQC05ylRBT2pjNHu75u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21276,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shakespeare's
