This is in fact a kind of boy and girl exchange among families, with an intention of marriage. Alireza is a young man of 36 years who, along with his sister, became a victim of this tradition after being forced to marry his own cousin. After visiting Tehran and seeing open relationships between men and women, he gets frustrated and after a while separates from his wife. After several years, Alireza has now decided to choose a spouse once again, regardless of the wishes of his parents, and by ignoring cumbersome old traditions.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qEelVh1FSXMVfnmA4lxjtK8LnCO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2018-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gharshelegh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2100954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reza Gholami-Motlagh","original_name":"Reza Gholami-Motlagh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/sqeQjzuURN8BfPMBs3sOG4OwFpg.jpg","credit_id":"5b7490599251411da3003949","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2100954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reza Gholami-Motlagh","original_name":"Reza Gholami-Motlagh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/sqeQjzuURN8BfPMBs3sOG4OwFpg.jpg","credit_id":"5b7490679251411d9a0031dc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2100954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reza Gholami-Motlagh","original_name":"Reza Gholami-Motlagh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/sqeQjzuURN8BfPMBs3sOG4OwFpg.jpg","credit_id":"5b74905f9251411dad003580","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2100954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reza Gholami-Motlagh","original_name":"Reza Gholami-Motlagh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/sqeQjzuURN8BfPMBs3sOG4OwFpg.jpg","credit_id":"5b689541c3a36818880d85a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gxPaCWrA6xNIvgih10G5X0KfCmK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x0M6bVadCYbe7SYD5G4vKg0nITn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qEelVh1FSXMVfnmA4lxjtK8LnCO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":571},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fa","file_path":"/lCEJUtVLVjYq9QrdrttlvuK8YQp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":530},{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1071,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zz7yiVfJPcYEQb4X4t4eBrMnV1x.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":753}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
