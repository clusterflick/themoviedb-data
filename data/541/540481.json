One day, a major crime boss keels over dead in the brothel run by his mother. Trying to keep the whole thing quiet before the guy's underling return to pick him up, Kok's mother stuffs the corpse into the box and stashes it in Kok's parking lot. When the thugs put the squeeze on mom, she claims that she dumped the corpse in the harbor, which inevitably leads to even more hilarious complications.","popularity":0.5122,"poster_path":"/8Z8oLB3TX3QIZ7YwTcIjsOfMluU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109995,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reel Films","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1982-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Darling, My Goddess","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Sweetheart Goddess","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"My Darling, My Goddess","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"愛人女神","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Tam","original_name":"譚詠麟","popularity":0.6911,"profile_path":"/vKB7KXRhersKKha1n4dbJpQaud6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ah Kok","credit_id":"5b6617eec3a368189707d180","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1402734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yiu Wai","original_name":"Yiu Wai","popularity":0.3283,"profile_path":"/gHGuf6gsQws8TIPrqqM3UaPL1pz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Brothel manager","credit_id":"5b661880925141406a07d01d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Chan Wai-Man","original_name":"陳惠敏","popularity":1.1133,"profile_path":"/xrDFaI9nuOsb6GWzcYsP6QBhnQe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Policeman/Triad","credit_id":"5b6617ff92514168b600887c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Tung Biu","original_name":"董驃","popularity":0.7646,"profile_path":"/nB6ywhsUy3TlZpsulqtgR45IFUK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Don Phew","credit_id":"5b66181bc3a368188d079db6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":990443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalis Chan Pak-Cheung","original_name":"陳百祥","popularity":0.8346,"profile_path":"/ubLzf8WcFzoz5XRIcKHA9MfbRHt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lek","credit_id":"5b66183cc3a368188609ab2a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Wong Jim","original_name":"黃霑","popularity":0.7887,"profile_path":"/gmZZNrvwFIpo3kB9L51wQircqlH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Randy Jim","credit_id":"5b6618940e0a267ef108410a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1015039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shrila Chun Wai-Man","original_name":"秦蔚文","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/lK4gGz0xmFiIPEHUvFnD4wqjRhb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"DD","credit_id":"5b661870c3a368188609ab8e","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1416538,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tony Hope","original_name":"Tony Hope","popularity":0.0727,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6617e00e0a267ef1084071","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148016,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Hippisley-Coxe","original_name":"Nicolas Hippisley-Coxe","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bbfe8e80e0a266e6400bbdb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1416538,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tony Hope","original_name":"Tony Hope","popularity":0.0727,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bbfe8fb0e0a266e5700b66d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0121057","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":754,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8Z8oLB3TX3QIZ7YwTcIjsOfMluU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":539}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
