We experience an embodied cinematic experience realised through a sensuous aesthetic as we are invited to enter a strange and uncertain world of inner depths and hypnotising effects. There, we encounter three women actantes, embodied by the artists, who play mythic and magical female figures such as Medusa and Salome. They metamorphose, dance and enter trances where the body vibrates into transformation. Figures reveal themselves out of silence which is both the moment of creation and an eternal reality. The film itself actualises that which is inactual and gives form to blackness through a poetics of intimacy and an ethics of interpersonal relationships, which is founded in the artists’ own double authorship.","popularity":0.0987,"poster_path":"/ouo1yKWufJEt7otN8znO41wnPsr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98568,"logo_path":null,"name":"A.S.T.A.R.T.I.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1980-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":165,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unheimlich II: Astarti","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1307595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Klonaris","original_name":"Maria Klonaris","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/a0KDZkOO7frMCMVPq50CPdzDfii.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b66338ac3a3681899079509","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1307597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parvaneh Navaï","original_name":"Parvaneh Navaï","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b6633940e0a267ef1086add","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1307596,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katerina Thomadaki","original_name":"Katerina Thomadaki","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/uWHHY6c99Up8DG3J1VtANMQqLZy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b66339c0e0a267ef80893e8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1307595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Klonaris","original_name":"Maria Klonaris","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/a0KDZkOO7frMCMVPq50CPdzDfii.jpg","credit_id":"5b663353925141405407b67e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1307596,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katerina Thomadaki","original_name":"Katerina Thomadaki","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/uWHHY6c99Up8DG3J1VtANMQqLZy.jpg","credit_id":"5b66335d925141406a07f809","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10862274","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hZHWYAAcrf6JE50VYYgAqfdV1Fx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wtfCiiJgNPd795fc3G0yVpjUjCi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1115,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ouo1yKWufJEt7otN8znO41wnPsr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":743},{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8wNfm6N3JODeuQVTUNPWMRTft31.jpg","vote_average":0.958,"vote_count":4,"width":755},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bPKTOIqZszPgpKiRx1jyF0lmYk9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bzHjEcsktjvw7ujavY2iSV6WWzb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1115,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Kpi5B77ZQwVJe66yZlgXrVL8Xu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":743}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Théâtre de poche, Bienne","release_date":"1980-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Biennale de Paris","release_date":"1980-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Centre culturel de l'Abbaye","release_date":"1981-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"London Film Festival","release_date":"2019-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
