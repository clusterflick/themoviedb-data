It’s a cinematic journey into the world of dreams, filled with memories, desires, and the incessant quest for the ever-elusive happiness.  The trains have played an important role in the history of cinema. A lot of interesting phenomena are linked with trains – locomotion, changes, an opportunity to think, dynamics, force, sense of something important… It helps to cross the usual boundaries.","popularity":0.0486,"poster_path":"/kyrWsyQ49yQgnCKtncUc4xClHG0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":214406,"logo_path":null,"name":"Camera Obscura","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2016-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Only Trains Remember That","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1879349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jānis Putniņš","original_name":"Jānis Putniņš","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/hpsGd1dH45EjlSdbXH3pe4vt9Dx.jpg","credit_id":"5b6882c60e0a267ef10d6a89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1879349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jānis Putniņš","original_name":"Jānis Putniņš","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/hpsGd1dH45EjlSdbXH3pe4vt9Dx.jpg","credit_id":"5fc281f5894ed60040fd2204","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1879349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jānis Putniņš","original_name":"Jānis Putniņš","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/hpsGd1dH45EjlSdbXH3pe4vt9Dx.jpg","credit_id":"5fc2820f420228003ec04342","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1879349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jānis Putniņš","original_name":"Jānis Putniņš","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/hpsGd1dH45EjlSdbXH3pe4vt9Dx.jpg","credit_id":"5fc28201894ed60043fd3cc0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2271602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Signe Birkova","original_name":"Signe Birkova","popularity":0.0821,"profile_path":"/wR4S2nubVnMyFyN9jOEiGcanxy7.jpg","credit_id":"5fc282292bcf67003cbf7705","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1699652,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ernests Ansons","original_name":"Ernests Ansons","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fe41a590d417e003d4e9f13","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kyrWsyQ49yQgnCKtncUc4xClHG0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lv","note":"","release_date":"2016-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Filmas \"To atceras tikai vilcieni\" treileris","key":"QVVoYOu3M9c","published_at":"2016-11-30T15:00:05.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5b6882e8c3a368188f0d5a09"}]}}}
