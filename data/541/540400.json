Set in 1960s Soho, the film delves into the world of UK and US organised crime, with gangland figures such as the Krays, boxing, gambling, police corruption and a string of brutal unsolved murders that would become synonymous with the name Freddie Mills. With access to eight hours of previously unseen home movies, this is an intimate portrayal of a man who rose from the humble surroundings of the fairground boxing booth to become world light-heavyweight champion and became a household name appearing on television and in films. But it all ended on 25 July 1965, when he was found shot dead in the back seat of his car.","popularity":0.0482,"poster_path":"/azgqa2bdRrCQFhweL85bJGZtn1z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murder in Soho: Who Killed Freddie Mills?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freddie Mills","original_name":"Freddie Mills","popularity":0.1422,"profile_path":"/sBcuEJ9xup8coJiCBMaiaZcMs4D.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"(Archive Footage)","credit_id":"5c6356799251417aa2f9c991","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1226244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Murray","original_name":"Pete Murray","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fb86240c740d9003be97d4f","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2099675,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Simon Dales","original_name":"Simon Dales","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b65c01fc3a368189408e873","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/azgqa2bdRrCQFhweL85bJGZtn1z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
