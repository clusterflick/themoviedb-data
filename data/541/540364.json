Henry King and Ruth Roland starred in each episode, playing different roles each time, with a variety of supporting players who varied from one episode to another. Each episode told a complete and individual story, but they were all inter-related by a uniform theme. Although there were no cliff-hanger endings, each episode did, in fact, end with a challenge to the audience: Who was responsible for the misfortune of the principal characters? The titles of the twelve episodes were: #1: The Price of Fame; #2: The Pursuit of Pleasure; #3: When Justice Sleeps; #4: The Love Liar; #5: Unto Herself Alone; #6: Houses of Glass; #7: Blue Blood and Yellow; #8: Today and Tomorrow; #9: For the Commonwealth; #10: Pomp of Earth; #11: The Fruit of Folly; #12: Toil and Tyranny.","popularity":0.3588,"poster_path":"/ljhrl8kwhyPZTEO4IpvPTLNKh4P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37907,"logo_path":null,"name":"Balboa Amusement Producing Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":360,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Pays?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37362,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry King","original_name":"Henry King","popularity":0.3557,"profile_path":"/bJpytCyMCSpoM3wlN8ZkeqZlr2b.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Karl Hurd","credit_id":"5b65662cc3a368188806fc8c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Roland","original_name":"Ruth Roland","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/jANjK6xntsIsuAeG2UE44kc7W6k.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Laura Powers","credit_id":"5b656678c3a368189906562f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Brady","original_name":"Ed Brady","popularity":0.147,"profile_path":"/vVep5r5nxvuex9RrYXJ8THR5uuM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b6566c80e0a267ef606e11a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Gilfether","original_name":"Daniel Gilfether","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/qo9E6W2hVJwpvW52IEZ5xyUEcgc.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The \"Lumber King\"","credit_id":"5b6566fb0e0a267ee506b685","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1476427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mollie McConnell","original_name":"Mollie McConnell","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":"/iPVpckFs2DLqG6Q9jaRWGw7qM0v.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b656728c3a3681886084216","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Dudley","original_name":"Charles Dudley","popularity":0.1078,"profile_path":"/yH2HClkgXCTeXAFTttFAs2ywgX9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b656731c3a368189d06c02b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":33951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gypsy Abbott","original_name":"Gypsy Abbott","popularity":0.0553,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5b6567640e0a267ef807337b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2099576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank H.
