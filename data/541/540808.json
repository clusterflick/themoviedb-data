The film’s speed suggests the idea of an impermanent flux, attempting to create a transient, felt experience. Variant “pushes to experiential and formal extremes the deployment of schematic and repetitive structures.” (Federico Windhausen)","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sRtaqFC5KctDB6wH91pzmiQOxzI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1973-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Variant","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451151,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Du Cane","original_name":"John Du Cane","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6862b50e0a267ef80d2995","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7354574","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sRtaqFC5KctDB6wH91pzmiQOxzI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Festival of Independent Avant-Garde Film","release_date":"1973-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
