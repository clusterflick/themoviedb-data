From humble beginnings and overcoming much adversity, they were labelled the Skid Kids and would gain worldwide attention for their reckless, no-holds-barred approach to surfing Shark Island, a wave previously deemed unrideable. Driven by the desire to push the limits in both wave-riding and life, the Skid Kids revolutionised board design, created innovative competitions and became infamous for their wild antics both in and out of the water. A classic Australian coming of age story, Holding On features never-before-seen footage and a killer soundtrack supervised by Parkway Drive’s Winston McCall.","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":"/6ZhM1X5kRWZfXGy87pWNbrtGkoc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Holding On","title":"Holding On","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xLMJA9fN6wWR0YatmqIR9ZAfxTB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6ZhM1X5kRWZfXGy87pWNbrtGkoc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
