Apollo, god of art, beauty and divinations, incites all sorts of rumors, even the craziest ones. The Apollo of Gaza is at once an inquiry and a meditation on history, plunging us into the barely known reality of a territory that is still paying the price of wars and a merciless blockade, but where life also subsists, undefeated. By bringing a little light to the sky of Gaza, the statue and its stupefying story could return some dignity and hope to all people.","popularity":0.1201,"poster_path":"/8PdvKdnZhvgQ3g6tlIASS7an2B2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16277,"logo_path":"/wVZrimZweNIYZ0BDRINDZF9W2TJ.png","name":"Akka
