Danny O'Brien, 22, dedicates one last summer to his family's failing real estate agency, and to his father Joe's seemingly obsolete values: poetry, integrity, and community. The O'Briens are challenged - endangered - by heartless capitalist modernism, as practiced by the liars and cheaters at Superlative Properties, realtors to the Ultra-Wealthy and Fabulous. Danny complicates the game by falling in love with Clare, a beautiful and suspiciously sophisticated Superlative summer intern. All is framed by the mad swirl of \"summer people\" who party, sleep around and generally amuse themselves as they indulge in the excesses of \"The Season.\" And key players chase the grand prize: the open auction, on Labor Day, of Tilden Point - the last great parcel of virgin land on the East Coast.","popularity":1.1122,"poster_path":"/6J2NaicuWvl1LrnG48Fg1FXvAmu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Bones","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Good Bones","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blanchard Ryan","original_name":"Blanchard Ryan","popularity":0.2347,"profile_path":"/7dLq8Yo8ZuxaE34p9XZhQpPXtSJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mrs. Hunsecker","credit_id":"5b72caf50e0a267eeb1c6808","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1377050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodora Miranne","original_name":"Theodora Miranne","popularity":0.1664,"profile_path":"/vEfpT4ADvAQ0w13Iuc7DQs37Cmq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pippa Quayle (as Theodora Woolley)","credit_id":"5b72cb279251414056176535","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":171986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larkin Malloy","original_name":"Larkin Malloy","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/xKmUaVl8eQGhxyovlJEwwEXmkaW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Charles Schuyler","credit_id":"5b72cb369251414056176544","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1689264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Jean Killoren","original_name":"Kelly Jean Killoren","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/k7keEwuMPhAPeByOgRUXPqxKXPm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Incentive Actress","credit_id":"5b72cb4c0e0a267ef81bb7e7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2107099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Botsford","original_name":"Andrew Botsford","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Judge Milkin","credit_id":"5b72cb8192514140681ab64d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2107100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Brandman","original_name":"David Brandman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Cameraman","credit_id":"5b72cb8dc3a36818861ff4c2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1803481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Comfort Clinton","original_name":"Comfort Clinton","popularity":0.2232,"profile_path":"/yCo15nQnetHgh9P1ppsxp16OPwf.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Clare Logan","credit_id":"5b72cb9b925141404f179c62","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Gregory","original_name":"Nick Gregory","popularity":0.2318,"profile_path":"/grDBOwlQvbmJRA6yIOwDLBiXJcv.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Rich Husband One","credit_id":"5b72cbaa0e0a267eeb1c68d4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1226319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Bohn","original_name":"Tim Bohn","popularity":0.1596,"profile_path":"/8bcxxQMaBLjEYOLnLAUje710Iq4.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Walker","credit_id":"5bac913e0e0a2664c90389ee","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1373342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Watson","original_name":"Matthew Watson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Danny O’Brien","credit_id":"620250a48258fc0043fb5518","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikal Evans","original_name":"Mikal Evans","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/xNe8sNwiymWmd0BiPioPEzurM9c.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Seaweed Girl","credit_id":"662fd92ce33f830128222ad1","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Lage","original_name":"Jordan Lage","popularity":0.274,"profile_path":"/ogeyO33wOmV7XXBii1U8A0kkBgC.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Hugh Duckner","credit_id":"662fd9488a88b20124cee3eb","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1377050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theodora Miranne","original_name":"Theodora Miranne","popularity":0.1664,"profile_path":"/vEfpT4ADvAQ0w13Iuc7DQs37Cmq.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Pippa Quayle","credit_id":"662fd9637d5db501263ead08","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3087891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Noble","original_name":"Jack Noble","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Lyle Wilson","credit_id":"662fd9848a88b20124cee3fe","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2694522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Vawer","original_name":"Michelle Vawer","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/2uKDBqrSbLfyuLTVIOnyptX5P0x.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Melissa","credit_id":"662fd9961f0275012a14e173","order":14},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert G.
