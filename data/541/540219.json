Cole’s film is inspired by two separate but intertwined stories; the real lives of desperate women and the babies they gave up to the care of the Foundling Hospital, which are meticulously documented in the Hospital’s archives; and Heathcliff, the foundling antihero in Wuthering Heights. Set in modern day Liverpool, the film shines a light on how the lives of women, celebrated or unknown, were so circumscribed by society in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and considers the extent to which progress has been made.","popularity":0.8042,"poster_path":"/Aj3mLOFMo0hZS9WpO83njHP2bmP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Balls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2118669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tia Bannon","original_name":"Tia Bannon","popularity":0.1398,"profile_path":"/mkWIWjGQfK1E406ZYNyNURQGfHy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Peggy","credit_id":"5b88c13f9251414cf8006efc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1173252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gillian Bevan","original_name":"Gillian Bevan","popularity":0.1031,"profile_path":"/dEsbdPQDL3tuCpWS5EpZ7vxUOe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jean","credit_id":"5b88c14d0e0a2679b9004de4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":190895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Gadon","original_name":"Sarah Gadon","popularity":1.3512,"profile_path":"/r0WjZpOuIjF9BRP8y0MDkZ4j1x9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mary Ann","credit_id":"5b88c1569251414cdd0063b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Sessions","original_name":"John Sessions","popularity":0.4735,"profile_path":"/8bN5H7T9XtOMijCwGndaMVCQ2sI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Brownlow","credit_id":"5b88c162c3a3682e6300596d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015760,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stacey Gregg","original_name":"Stacey Gregg","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6053e3a3fa78cd0027e13d82","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Cole","original_name":"Lily Cole","popularity":0.6361,"profile_path":"/qlElHZNvZapaLxQrz5l3lXzBWXo.jpg","credit_id":"5b6457ebc3a368189904b90d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Cole","original_name":"Lily Cole","popularity":0.6361,"profile_path":"/qlElHZNvZapaLxQrz5l3lXzBWXo.jpg","credit_id":"5b88c1749251414ce3004493","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8789736","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1478,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Aj3mLOFMo0hZS9WpO83njHP2bmP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":984}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
