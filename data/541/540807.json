Du Cane’s rarely shown films are amongst the most pure and radical of their period. Instinctive yet formal, structured and organic, the physical world is turned into a screen-based labyrinth that is both surface and depth, through the retinal rush of incremental superimpositions and delicate cameral control.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tXz4GxY7qjRy6r2XCoK4PXcPLP7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1973-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sign","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451151,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Du Cane","original_name":"John Du Cane","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b68625ec3a368188f0d0aac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7846810","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tXz4GxY7qjRy6r2XCoK4PXcPLP7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"London Film-Makers' Co-operative","release_date":"1973-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
