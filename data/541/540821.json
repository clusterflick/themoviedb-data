Like other films by Judith Noble (formerly Higginbottom), The Red Sea is concerned with the menstrual cycle, and its relationship to lunar cycle. Higginbottom and other feminist artists such as Catherine Elwes, Carolee Schneemann and Judy Clark were trying to reclaim menstruation from its negative image and assert it as a source of creative energy. The Red Sea is made of 16mm film and 35mm still images, re-worked and over-printed.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1DdICRE2JOSZDpEEL9hB1xQ6U9g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1891980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judith Noble","original_name":"Judith Noble","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b686c67c3a36818970c9d69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8090688","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1DdICRE2JOSZDpEEL9hB1xQ6U9g.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1292,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gKbBMwbVxu92FtFHV9Qv8AxmEr6.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":861}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
