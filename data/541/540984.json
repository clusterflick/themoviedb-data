The show celebrated her 20 years in pop music and acted as promotion for the release of her tenth studio album, X. The show featured the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra as well as the Crazy Horse Girls as her backing dancers, flown in from Paris to perform especially for the show. The show also featured memorable sketches: in particular, one in which her ex-boyfriend and former co-star Jason Donovan fails to recognise her; and another where she has a catfight with her sister, Dannii, and winds up punching Simon Cowell in the face. At the conclusion of the program, Minogue turns around in her makeup chair, revealing herself to be Joan Collins.","popularity":1.1184,"poster_path":"/qkBCtfMvXbz1O7LNuPHLXuIsdT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3448,"logo_path":"/dcA8JDfnnQPMaq8lv2CCiYrNe0S.png","name":"ITV","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Kylie's hour-long special to promote the album \"X\".","title":"The Kylie Show","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kylie Minogue","original_name":"Kylie Minogue","popularity":0.7125,"profile_path":"/cThzknnZHlkT5PXiDY8X12Ze2wm.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b695ac70e0a267ef10ee80f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Collins","original_name":"Joan Collins","popularity":1.5519,"profile_path":"/jmXqOnp2xBDl2EMuU5Rj39uHzUQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b695ae50e0a267eed0f8df5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1173226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dannii Minogue","original_name":"Dannii Minogue","popularity":0.1836,"profile_path":"/dZBjr3Rirvu7dYOR9xAbMszeH6t.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b695aed92514140560d1708","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":165899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Cowell","original_name":"Simon Cowell","popularity":1.0631,"profile_path":"/My1ntuj7FdrO1rnJW4FKGesRRp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b695b0492514168b6068c5a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luke Evans","original_name":"Luke Evans","popularity":3.2267,"profile_path":"/qUkYJcrDc4M0LHNYASs30luFvw0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b695b180e0a267ef80f3539","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Donovan","original_name":"Jason Donovan","popularity":0.4743,"profile_path":"/bwQx8cbD9Rq8uPZ0vq1TPkPS4uX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b695b2b0e0a267ee50e604a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1743874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Staffurth","original_name":"Simon Staffurth","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6447beb8397df004944c037c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1485103,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Bert Tyler-Moore","original_name":"Bert Tyler-Moore","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b7e8efe0e0a2615bd013d7e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1485102,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"George Jeffrie","original_name":"George Jeffrie","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c30c5fac3a3682919a92d63","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1485102,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"George Jeffrie","original_name":"George Jeffrie","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c30c5f59251416d946fc4fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1156316","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Im4rrznLOm8fVaqaqcPiZNg3OK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":826,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t0F0PLQnTflKIwZvgLpSuEQcyuN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":583},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":841,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qkBCtfMvXbz1O7LNuPHLXuIsdT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":561}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2992,"name":"diva"},{"id":189160,"name":"music special"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
