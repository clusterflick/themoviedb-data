Darkness invades the view and seems to leave no escape, but unexpectedly beyond the darkness there is something, a new beginning, an elsewhere from which to start again. A world made of millenary rocks and concretions. A cave full of beauty and mystery, where nothing is what it seems.The only guide is a light on the head, whose shadows draw on the wet walls a new story. Exploring the wonders of the subsoil and looking for the way out of the eternal darkness, the viewer will be the protagonist of an allegorical journey in search of life and rebirth.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":"/nRiagrN1zJ2wUTYxhY1a4grlO4H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19917,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transmedia","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2018-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Cave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1547251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maruša Majer","original_name":"Maruša Majer","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":"/t3kjdW7aRdgyy2tpCKVONrEiF7F.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b68276c92514140640bd35c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Serban","original_name":"Bruno Serban","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b6827750e0a267eed0ce70a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Sfetez","original_name":"Claudia Sfetez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5b68277d0e0a267ef60c312e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100697,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Antonio Giacomin","original_name":"Antonio Giacomin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b68274792514140540b4b4d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100698,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Cej","original_name":"David Cej","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b68275c925141404f0ab745","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Gergolet","original_name":"Ivan Gergolet","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b68272392514140640bd2b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1363492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Gergolet","original_name":"Ivan Gergolet","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f018303d0b434003568a1ef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nRiagrN1zJ2wUTYxhY1a4grlO4H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venezia 75 - Venice Virtual Reality","release_date":"2018-09-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
