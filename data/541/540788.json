Itâ€™s a collage film which combines photographic, animated and live-action parts, black and white and colour footage. The voice-over soundtrack is partly a reworking and rewording of individual experiences and also a reflection on perceived actions of women due to historical and contemporary circumstance. It draws on a rich collection of personal and public imagery, re-made and manipulated, layered and textured, while taking a critical look at certain feminist theories.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1klqhWbp0cG1RHBeXo5fXnQhJhp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tracks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1874377,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Stein","original_name":"Susan Stein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b6857d2c3a36853750431a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7m05VZBl4Men5vj0f23Y0kML4AX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1klqhWbp0cG1RHBeXo5fXnQhJhp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
