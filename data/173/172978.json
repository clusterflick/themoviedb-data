Murer wrote and directed this Swiss drama about a family with a missing child. The only explanation seems to be kidnapping, but no ransom note arrives. Police inspector Anatol Wasser (Hanspeter Muller) soon faces an elaborate mystery: a dozen Swiss children vanish with no indication of any pattern -- other than the fact that they all lived near lakes. Is organized crime responsible, or does the answer lie in mystical realms? Shown at the 1998 Montreal Film Festival.","popularity":0.3198,"poster_path":"/Bo5pI8xkYdND5HlBcsIFQuaxSN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1998-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Full Moon","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanspeter Müller","original_name":"Hanspeter Müller","popularity":0.1285,"profile_path":"/xnqyixxYCJI0cPtsdhenqIzmf3T.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Anatol Wasser","credit_id":"52fe4d2ac3a36847f82524a9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilo Baur","original_name":"Lilo Baur","popularity":0.0872,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Irene Escher","credit_id":"52fe4d2ac3a36847f82524ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benedict Freitag","original_name":"Benedict Freitag","popularity":0.2708,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Max Escher","credit_id":"52fe4d2ac3a36847f82524b1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariebelle Kuhn","original_name":"Mariebelle Kuhn","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Emmi Escher","credit_id":"52fe4d2ac3a36847f82524b5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yolande Moreau","original_name":"Yolande Moreau","popularity":0.3758,"profile_path":"/f7lsmnQoml8dwpFtB4pUQbOhqUE.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marie Rochat","credit_id":"52fe4d2ac3a36847f82524b9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angelika Bartsch","original_name":"Angelika Bartsch","popularity":0.2788,"profile_path":"/jAZAWElwgMTVyQeHLb08BhS6Ojz.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Ingeborg Gilardi-Hölzle","credit_id":"5666d914c3a36808f3000fd4","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fredi M.
