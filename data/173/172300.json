He learns about love as he struggles for his last chance to play in a major global tournament. And he desperately wants to earn the respect of his estranged father, a former great West Indies cricketer.  This inspirational and emotional drama, punctuated with excitement, intrigue and love, recounts how Alex Nelson, a talented but inconsistent cricketer, has been sidelined from the West Indies team for scuffling with his coach, Amir Misra of India. Blackballed by the team for three years, he pursues an unlikely quest to get back on the team for a last chance to play in the Global One Day Series â€” an opportunity unfairly denied to his father.","popularity":0.4614,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":197615,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Waters Productions","origin_country":"BB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BB","name":"Barbados"}],"release_date":"2007-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Caribbean story of love, scandal and desire.","title":"Hit for Six","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2301786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Pilgrim","original_name":"Andrew Pilgrim","popularity":0.0497,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Alex Nelson","credit_id":"5cc99eb20e0a263447f32042","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":164904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolph Walker","original_name":"Rudolph Walker","popularity":0.2081,"profile_path":"/b28mC01hzC1S4O7LpvElEbJcNR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Colin Thompson","credit_id":"5cc99ec3c3a36847dd837985","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2301787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tino Best","original_name":"Tino Best","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Cricketer","credit_id":"5cc99ed7c3a3687443815d18","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Cozier","original_name":"Tony Cozier","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Commentator","credit_id":"5cc99eeb0e0a264ef4f30b9d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1250266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Everton Weekes","original_name":"Everton Weekes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Everton Weekes","credit_id":"5cc99f479251416e1ef39377","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2845424,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeanille Bonterre","original_name":"Jeanille Bonterre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Astrid Jones","credit_id":"64358618e6357100f27a1937","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":60042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alison Sealy-Smith","original_name":"Alison Sealy-Smith","popularity":0.2733,"profile_path":"/w4TSJBggA4c1YnXenKIOHYwuLla.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ianthe Nelson","credit_id":"64358621ec8a4302192682b2","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2301785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alison Saunders-Franklyn","original_name":"Alison Saunders-Franklyn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc99e779251416e2bf38d23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2301785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alison Saunders-Franklyn","original_name":"Alison Saunders-Franklyn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc99e91c3a36874258161ad","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1016184","wikidata_id":"Q12124790","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5719,"name":"cricket"},{"id":3692,"name":"scandal"},{"id":9840,"name":"romance"},{"id":9639,"name":"playboy"},{"id":167861,"name":"caribbean sea"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hit for Six!
