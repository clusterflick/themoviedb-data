This experimental satire that examines what happens when a South Korean filmmaker sojourns into communist North Korea to breathe new life into that country's flagging, propaganda-driven movie industry. Believing that cinema can prop up North Korea's Juche Idea of self-reliance, mad dictator Kim Jong-Il pulls out all the stops to help the young émigré produce appropriate films.","popularity":0.1602,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Juche Idea","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jung Yoon Lee","original_name":"Jung Yoon Lee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Yoon Jung","credit_id":"52fe4d20c3a36847f8250037","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniela Kostova","original_name":"Daniela Kostova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Russian Woman","credit_id":"52fe4d20c3a36847f825003b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sung Kim","original_name":"Sung Kim","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"North Korean Man","credit_id":"52fe4d20c3a36847f825003f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleg Mavromatti","original_name":"Олег Мавроматти","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/jRMCF28csWqxp81CvXsJzi9mGez.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Russian Man","credit_id":"52fe4d20c3a36847f8250043","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Finn","original_name":"Jim Finn","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/oDKCbuzJTwqZmkK2cHy6M2cSqVn.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d20c3a36847f825002d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Finn","original_name":"Jim Finn","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/oDKCbuzJTwqZmkK2cHy6M2cSqVn.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d20c3a36847f8250033","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1233599","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
