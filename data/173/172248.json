The phenomenon of an endless, flat, water surface produces a rich and beautiful flora and fauna. The abundance of fish provides food for countless species of birds and the boss of all swamps: alligators - gigantic, primeval reptiles as neighbours of the people that live here. However, the main goal of this journey is to find the Florida manatees.  They are regarded as the most serene and gentle animals in the world. Year for year, they migrate up the rivers from the Gulf of Mexico. It is only here, at the pleasantly warm springs, where one can experience this comparatively unknown and extremely threatened species first hand. They move their stately bodies astonishingly graceful, as if they were dancers in an underwater ballet. Magical light effects of the sun enable a backdrop of turquoise coloured water and roots to shine brilliantly. All in magical 3D.","popularity":0.2884,"poster_path":"/ptctT9QtdMrnV4xBAcIorEhOwmn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90823,"logo_path":null,"name":"Syrinx Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":5373,"logo_path":null,"name":"KSM Film","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adventure Everglades 3D - The Manatees of Crystal River","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Abenteuer Everglades 3D","type":"Alternative"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Steyer","original_name":"Christian Steyer","popularity":0.146,"profile_path":"/mjHNODhlnjheVGrwN2XPGuPay5q.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5928e664c3a368783e042f5e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Solman","original_name":"Colin Solman","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":"/1QGzpM9cwaySHXGPYrgGd9d3UEr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5928e66c9251413b50041764","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1824306,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dirk Lachmann","original_name":"Dirk Lachmann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5928e5ba9251413b45044261","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1122531,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jürgen Klimmeck","original_name":"Jürgen Klimmeck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5928e5fac3a36877df045792","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565738,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Bettina Seifert","original_name":"Bettina Seifert","popularity":0.108,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5928e582c3a36877fd03a8c1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725841,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Burkhard Neesen","original_name":"Burkhard Neesen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5928e5919251413b54040603","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087218,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Benjamin Krause","original_name":"Benjamin Krause","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5928e6129251413b50041711","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1286441,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hans-Joachim Ernst","original_name":"Hans-Joachim Ernst","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5928e5e09251413b410428b0","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12036098","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ptctT9QtdMrnV4xBAcIorEhOwmn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3186,"name":"everglades"},{"id":211142,"name":"manatee"},{"id":214996,"name":"florida everglades"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
