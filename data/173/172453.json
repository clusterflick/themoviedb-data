They're called virtual worlds and are 3D computer generated universes where you sign up, choose a body, build a house and you're ready to live out your Second Life. In online virtual worlds, like Second Life, everyone is beautiful or exotic. You can chat up strangers, slay mythical dragons or create your fantasy business and even make real money. Some claim Second Life will be more influential than eBay or MySpace. 'You Only Live Twice' takes a fascinating, sometimes humorous, look at the heavily marketed promises and potential pitfalls of virtual worlds.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Only Live Twice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
