Suddenly there come running into the place a lot of Turkish men and women preceding some Turkish policemen, who drag along four prisoners in chains. The policemen shut up the four prisoners in the pillory. Their four heads stick up through the huge plank, which is provided with four openings. One of the policemen urges the executioner to decapitate the prisoners. He accordingly seizes a mighty sabre and cuts off by a single stroke the four heads, which roll upon the ground.","popularity":0.3223,"poster_path":"/wWAw3FOvGW8wpqThlp9twVkHxvD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star Film","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":37046,"logo_path":null,"name":"Georges Méliès","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1903-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Terrible Turkish Executioner","video":false,"vote_average":6.096,"vote_count":26,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le terrible bourreau turc","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Lefejezés Törökországban","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Decapitation in Turkey","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El Verdugo Turco","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":0.1982,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Executioner","credit_id":"551a752dc3a368237c001340","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":0.1982,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d1ac3a36847f824ebe5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0222844","wikidata_id":"Q101245229","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uSj7fa2Ax8y8EXetQKHldFxTzXu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/wWAw3FOvGW8wpqThlp9twVkHxvD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1563,"name":"prisoner"},{"id":11181,"name":"decapitation"},{"id":13129,"name":"execution"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1903-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
