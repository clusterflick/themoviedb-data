It examines the evolution of the World of Warcraft from its infancy to its non-existent conclusion and beyond, into the world of obsession.  Through the lives of several key characters, it shows the joys associated with online games, and offers a objective look at some of its inherent trappings.  /afk seeks to create a dialog about gamers in an attempt to bring understanding to the online gaming phenomenon and the millions of gamers behind the World of Warcraft; the most successful MMO of all time.  In doing so, one might assert that gaming can no sooner be understood than that of any other form of addiction: if it's an addiction at all.","popularity":0.2169,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"/afk: Away from Keyboard","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerald Block","original_name":"Jerald Block","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56035ac3c3a3685526003781","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik Bludau","original_name":"Erik Bludau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56035ac39251416f0f00147f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Culbertson","original_name":"Craig Culbertson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56035ac4c3a3685541003316","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Culbertson","original_name":"Scott Culbertson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56035ac49251416f0f001486","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ron Jaffe","original_name":"Ron Jaffe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56035ac4c3a368553a003597","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillip Maurer","original_name":"Phillip Maurer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56035ac492514122ca003123","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Stuetze","original_name":"Brian Stuetze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56035ac5c3a368553a00359c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Stuetze","original_name":"Brigitte Stuetze","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"56035ac592514122c0003483","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1155074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg Stuetze","original_name":"Greg Stuetze","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"56035ac5c3a368554100331a","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ross Stuetze","original_name":"Ross Stuetze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"56035ac69251416f0f00148b","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liz Woolley","original_name":"Liz Woolley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"56035ac69251416f0f001490","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1155074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg Stuetze","original_name":"Greg Stuetze","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d20c3a36847f824fee9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1713945","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":282,"name":"video game"},{"id":10442,"name":"world of warcraft"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
