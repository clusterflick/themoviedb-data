Calling her friend Marceline “the second part of this legend [of Joris Ivens]”, she pays tribute to her as one who, after losing her “beloved and symbiotic partner, has kept her dynamism and liveliness as a person and a filmmaker”. The cinematic portrait illustrates how Loridan was in fact much more than a shadow at Ivens’s side.","popularity":0.1035,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bride of the Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marceline Loridan-Ivens","original_name":"Marceline Loridan-Ivens","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/5FA0CbUo1brlK6qioaDCUrN8uZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d48c3c72d1e405082c18430","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1697856","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1998-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
