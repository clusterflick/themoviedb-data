The every day activities of people done in partial or total absence of light makes it hard to decipher what the viewer sees or yet again makes the viewer see more carefully, a way to glimpse a deeper reality. Sometimes the people seem at ease with darkness its almost as if night is not meant to be lit. Yet we see children playing and struggling to study in darkness and that makes one question the comfort with the dark.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/k3awyNipWd53HkFtgYst8pa4SlP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natasha Mendonca","original_name":"Natasha Mendonca","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d48327bc1e56e001367fa68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":885,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k3awyNipWd53HkFtgYst8pa4SlP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":590}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
