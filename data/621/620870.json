It does this by following a group of actors and students in their attempts to embody everything from animals to colours to strange masks ... at the same time it links the work to certain aspects of human cognition, as well as underlining the importance of ‘play-and-error’ for the creative act.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9fXs19vMFz0CKLy348JGeZJAQl3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sculpting the Body; a Theatre of Physicality","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Meyler","original_name":"Samuel Meyler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4813a5c1e56e63d1672e17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":760,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9fXs19vMFz0CKLy348JGeZJAQl3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":514}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
