From the perspective of the 21st century, it’s hard to imagine what a marvel the 1939-1940 New York World’s Fair would have been to its visitors. Still living in the heavy shadow of the stock market crash of 1929, the many people who flocked to the big exhibition found not only bounteous luxuries such as free Coca-Cola, but the unveiling of unthinkable new technologies that promised that a better world lay ahead. Using sparkling, rare, colour film footage – itself a brand-new technology at the time – the US director Amanda Murray mines the memories of several people who attended the New York World’s Fair in 1939.","popularity":0.0685,"poster_path":"/jH9XxrJAUpXPkxaGQZmOHoKkYDo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102068,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wicked Delicate Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"World Fair","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helene Schlesinger","original_name":"Helene Schlesinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5d47a8aea0be28081ea2610f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Schlesinger","original_name":"Stanley Schlesinger","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5d47a8bc2d1e405db5beee73","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seymour Sorkowitz","original_name":"Seymour Sorkowitz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5d47a8d42d1e405db5beee89","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1260944,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jim Stevenson","original_name":"Jim Stevenson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5d47a8e8c1e56e63d1665505","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ephraim Horowitz","original_name":"Ephraim Horowitz","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5d47a9372d1e405db5beefac","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379287,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amanda Murray","original_name":"Amanda Murray","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d47a5e0c1e56e001766b91c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379287,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amanda Murray","original_name":"Amanda Murray","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d47a7dec1e56e001466add4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Cheney","original_name":"Ian Cheney","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":"/9FAPlcviXcoAG1xPeVrJReDpaIZ.jpg","credit_id":"5d47a7eea0be283483a17fd7","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229459,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Cheney","original_name":"Ian Cheney","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":"/9FAPlcviXcoAG1xPeVrJReDpaIZ.jpg","credit_id":"5d47a803c1e56e001566c097","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2379290,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Frederick Shanahan","original_name":"Frederick Shanahan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d47a816c1e56e001766bc8d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379291,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hays Holladay","original_name":"Hays Holladay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d47a8262d1e400199be3f86","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379292,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ryan Holladay","original_name":"Ryan Holladay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d47a838c1e56e001766bcb8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ephraim Horowitz","original_name":"Ephraim Horowitz","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d47a956a0be280811a266a4","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379297,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian M.
