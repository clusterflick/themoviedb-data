It opens on the same set-up as Ten, in which Akbari and her then ten-year-old son Amin Maher bicker in the car. Cut to the present; both mother and son are in the same position in the car continuing their argument, but with a twist – Akbari is now directing herself as lead, and engaged in a fight against breast cancer that will end with her having a double mastectomy. She is thirty years old.","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"10+4 (Dah be alaveh chahar)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
