At first the camera dives into ordinary gestures, glances and movements of an urban shopping street. This choregraphy condenses more and more to become an interplay of shadows and light. Eventually, we arrive at an interzone - the border between wilderness and civilization. Inner landscapes open up and urban elements (streets, houses, construction buildings, etc.) melt in an image/sound montage into a system of mythical signs.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schattengrenze","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2163382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gunter Deller","original_name":"Gunter Deller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d480f7f2d1e405082bfd261","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
