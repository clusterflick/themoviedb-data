In 1950s Tangier, Larbi Salmi is a young, timid, pre-teen, boy, trying to make sense of the gentle religious upbringing of his father, the secular education offered him in French school, and his budding desires for the forbidden pleasures of the cinema and the women he meets through it.","popularity":0.1091,"poster_path":"/iMZDlBYKh1R34RqYiGvO81f8GJ4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A
