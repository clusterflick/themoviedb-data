The camera pans along frozen squares and zooms into details of the immediate surroundings - innocently reinventing tropes from video-art of the preceding two decades: the unit of “what happens” not an event, but an experience, as it falls oblivion together with the anonymous dreaming collective to which it occurred.","popularity":0.1095,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phenomenon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1400192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Tsyrlina","original_name":"Anna Tsyrlina","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/YEroHvt1WvDSGAnAWiBnaisRG3.jpg","credit_id":"616ca327e004a6005f09523f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2379887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sid Iandovka","original_name":"Sid Iandovka","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/jsOMjncYSqq4I4NFBId0bBE45H2.jpg","credit_id":"5d48bbc8028f140014007831","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
