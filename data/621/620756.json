This is their last chance. And here in Iqaluit, far to the north, they have found solitude, potential redemption, and, most unexpectedly, a place that’s not easy to leave. Claude, Ramy, Patrick, Michel and Chaïd are now taxi drivers, endlessly cruising the ring road, the dozen-kilometre highway that holds all their hopes, dreams and fears. Beautifully photographed by Donat Chabot, this unique film by Sophie Fortier is deeply melancholic and affecting.","popularity":0.1155,"poster_path":"/jHZRxb8xAUqCW1V09kouHib1DBA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107052,"logo_path":"/AoD2U5Mi0sCjZjN72kxS26uT2CH.png","name":"Spira","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":17704,"logo_path":"/wf9blZfYeKwIWs9Im4V9lfgjLNb.png","name":"Peripheria Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exile to the Wild West","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1284649,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Catherine Legault","original_name":"Catherine Legault","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d475a12a0be280454a54599","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2379095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Fortier","original_name":"Sophie Fortier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/3EfcLwOj8ESYKl2IKHj8lzR1E0c.jpg","credit_id":"5d4759caa0be280810a1c9e9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2080362,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philip Kalin-Hajdu","original_name":"Philip Kalin-Hajdu","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d47592bc1e56e63d165a6bc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2379095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Fortier","original_name":"Sophie Fortier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/3EfcLwOj8ESYKl2IKHj8lzR1E0c.jpg","credit_id":"5d4759dbc1e56e0013660bfa","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1761581,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yanick Létourneau","original_name":"Yanick Létourneau","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4759a600fb6b00150ad0b2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2379095,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Fortier","original_name":"Sophie Fortier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/3EfcLwOj8ESYKl2IKHj8lzR1E0c.jpg","credit_id":"5d475915a0be280810a1c8e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379100,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luc Bouchard","original_name":"Luc Bouchard","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d475a632d1e405082be57f4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379099,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christ","original_name":"Christ","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d475a2ac1e56e0013660c8e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1345009,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Aube Foglia","original_name":"Aube Foglia","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d475a072d1e405db5be531a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379098,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Donat Chabot","original_name":"Donat Chabot","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4759f100fb6b00150ad147","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1063926,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrice LeBlanc","original_name":"Patrice LeBlanc","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d475a48c1e56e0013660cea","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5100184","wikidata_id":"Q107094357","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/xSVmLzJRMUtigmZGNmg5i7Ey5L4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zYeGxmXRd4l8a6MOXut5XF1f6hQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qPWGuEJas2krxPDj5fohgD4KVMF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/jHZRxb8xAUqCW1V09kouHib1DBA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
