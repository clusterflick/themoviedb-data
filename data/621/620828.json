He has a lot of enemies and a lot of problems. He is rushing, he is driven... Pavel's mother goes to the hospital, from her he learns that his father is alive. Pavel goes to a distant village and finds his father. Pavel's father has been blind for a long time, but this does not prevent him from living. He is always accompanied by a faithful assistant – a guide dog. Another life opens up to Pavel - the villagers, their simple way of life, the cares of the father. The mother also arrives, pursued by Paul's enemies, to take her son to a quiet place to \"sit out\". But Pavel does not leave the old man like a blind man, having felt a guide in him.","popularity":0.2143,"poster_path":"/zGiSTDHjNihwNyS1MLAxotSXgnf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2007-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guide","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Igor Lifanov","original_name":"Игорь Лифанов","popularity":0.36,"profile_path":"/1TEtrY1XVhhq1HyAKd3uZiW0GMe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d47dd08c1e56e0017671b94","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Golovin","original_name":"Владимир Головин","popularity":0.1837,"profile_path":"/2xq0xIItbUPsC19i2ShsUFex4Vg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d47dd32c1e56e00156728c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larisa Malevannaya","original_name":"Лариса Малеванная","popularity":0.2011,"profile_path":"/8Wa255OWC74jG7G2Q2tKkA2yPAY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d47dd3ac1e56e00156728cf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1388792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oksana Bazilevich","original_name":"Оксана Базилевич","popularity":0.1776,"profile_path":"/ilQdalW38e0uoVHloarFhRDNKGz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5d47dd42c1e56e63d166b87f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1874809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evgeniy Merkurev","original_name":"Евгений Меркурьев","popularity":0.0756,"profile_path":"/wFb0rSk8QN2xmCyyVrTsgAc6lgK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d47dd492d1e405083bf7c8b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Baranov","original_name":"Владимир Баранов","popularity":0.188,"profile_path":"/s522GSAEW4wuiVYMWpFy4OXgXg3.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d47dd51a0be283483a1e724","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1081522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatyana Ryabokon","original_name":"Татьяна Рябоконь","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":"/yyoResFY9AfCTOZtM8Jdyw9WfMg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d47dd5ba0be28081ea2bfa6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergei Dyachkov","original_name":"Sergei Dyachkov","popularity":0.1039,"profile_path":"/yHA1qs3ypaVWPCExM2dBLunuYYI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5d47dd73c1e56e63d166b907","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleksandr Khvan","original_name":"Александр Хван","popularity":0.103,"profile_path":"/4RmytzrwPPvNx7SsyGhJFpqvs2H.jpg","credit_id":"5d47dd8b2d1e405083bf7d51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1304717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dmitriy Svetozarov","original_name":"Dmitriy Svetozarov","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":"/1O2AmX9A4WnduaDZ118KEpZg6CK.jpg","credit_id":"5d47dd9c2d1e405db5bf5602","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582251,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrey Sigle","original_name":"Andrey Sigle","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/nVUR01NK86pw4OcdlVmpaaW3O7l.jpg","credit_id":"5d47ddad2d1e405db5bf5677","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1146802,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arkadiy Krasilshchikov","original_name":"Аркадий Красильщиков","popularity":0.0925,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d47ddce2d1e405082bf6624","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2112635,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ivan Bagaev","original_name":"Ivan Bagaev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ecT5uR4rJ2jPIrTTJwNqsgkVaxb.jpg","credit_id":"5d47dde72d1e405083bf7e19","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2379434,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vitaly Istomin","original_name":"Vitaly Istomin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d47de52c1e56e0017671f02","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7713814","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zGiSTDHjNihwNyS1MLAxotSXgnf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2007-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
