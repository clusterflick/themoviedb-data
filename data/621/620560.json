The film investigates the sometimes ineffable processes that are fundamental to music composition, performance, and the communication of meaning through art. Highlighting the nuanced challenges of private sexual identity projected outward into art, the film examines Del Trediciâ€™s personal transformations through the joys and sorrows of gay life, and his goal of communicating sexuality through music that is influential in modern culture. Through performances of Del Tredici's atonal and neo-Romantic music and interviews with world-renowned musicians and scholars, the film explores what sexuality in music represents creatively and what the implications of identifying an art form as gay, as Del Tredici has done, may be.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/71BFS1I1lLdKljaCnLPu99JtnuD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secret Music","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4295470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Del Tredici","original_name":"David Del Tredici","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"65158668c50ad2012c17ad5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2378286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Beliavsky","original_name":"Daniel Beliavsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6515866ea199a600c49c9362","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2378286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Beliavsky","original_name":"Daniel Beliavsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4677332d1e407086be75b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10665480","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/waMDrejSGHG7ixi1qSMHKr5bza5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/71BFS1I1lLdKljaCnLPu99JtnuD.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":506},{"aspect_ratio":0.647,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fExW0NaQzDJBSUsZO3HmpWpJRVX.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":647}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
