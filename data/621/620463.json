Returning to the scene of filming, this film goes in search of the poetic force that flows from end to end in Lamorisse's film.","popularity":0.1197,"poster_path":"/1m2jsKX6boHJEkd26D9zLZyTE4M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9021,"logo_path":"/uhEdcx6YFWXNKYcSah4ZZCWuDvx.png","name":"Shellac Sud","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":73467,"logo_path":"/2ShpO35d9Sja9UzdEzDtBk7DaQf.png","name":"Andolfi","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrait of Alain Emery: The Child Who Did Not Know How to Smile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"L'enfant qui ne souriait pas","type":"Error in transcription"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Emery","original_name":"Alain Emery","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/vwOD0OoauEUgcjdKjFk5X6Ayb1Q.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d45d76f5ed8e90015fc2b84","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2377893,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arnaud Dommere","original_name":"Arnaud Dommere","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d45d94a5ed8e90016fc2e6e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1522890,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas Ordonneau","original_name":"Thomas Ordonneau","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d45d8eb5ed8e90018fc2fb3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206956,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arnaud Dommerc","original_name":"Arnaud Dommerc","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d45d9c7a0be280455a2174e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2377891,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cyrille De Laleu","original_name":"Cyrille De Laleu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d45d9205545ca00125e29ed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2377890,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicolas Lebras","original_name":"Nicolas Lebras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d45d8f7a0be280455a21613","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2377892,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mélanie Vincent","original_name":"Mélanie Vincent","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d45d9325545ca00165e278a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":776,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1m2jsKX6boHJEkd26D9zLZyTE4M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":582}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
