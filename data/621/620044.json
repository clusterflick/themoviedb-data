A message pops up on the smart screen, thanking unit #30562 for signing in. \"Are you ready for your next shift?\" The mirror asks in a soft female voice. #30562 says yes and the screen loads her itinerary for the evening. It explains that her first guest will be a returning client.\r While the radio plays in the background, items get tossed in as Alex (Adriana Chechik), a 21-year-old college student, hurriedly packs for the weekend. It's her anniversary with Derek (Seth Gamble), her boyfriend of several years. \"Hey, pull over for a moment,\" she coos in his ear. Derek looks down at her hand before a smile crosses his face. Suddenly, he notices a red glowing light in the trees just past their car. \"Do you see that?\" He says, pointing. He looks in the direction of his finger at the ominous crimson glow.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/l3nRmpMuvP6AQYpRgki1uLI7xO9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97187,"logo_path":"/p4SuncmnR1bxoA6GNVEA4tQIn4y.png","name":"Pure Taboo","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Future Darkly 3","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Future Darkly Vol. 3","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Future Darkly Volume 3","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1308031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriana Chechik","original_name":"Adriana Chechik","popularity":45.204,"profile_path":"/dEdOJaLf2AADqQSM9Nc4rnJ3QjU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d440045ea7b0e00158a0345","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2021831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Willis","original_name":"Emily Willis","popularity":38.485,"profile_path":"/4l2exbHVH5m0HwKeXi822kpiAX1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d44004cea7b0e00158a034d","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1102224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Penny Pax","original_name":"Penny Pax","popularity":14.319,"profile_path":"/nSbrOhVWcOhd6QYHAbxi9V9wX9T.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d44006dea7b0e00158a03c8","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":3,"id":1846339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristen Scott","original_name":"Kristen Scott","popularity":12.916,"profile_path":"/ArUepA8bOS5HLOKTuBljnKvxmDI.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5d440073b7abb50015498f40","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":136093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Holmes","original_name":"Steve Holmes","popularity":18.796,"profile_path":"/hj3N1sbk7U1YAhZGsrgoevp2rDw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d44009ca9117f0015efb956","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":132144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seth Gamble","original_name":"Seth Gamble","popularity":12.937,"profile_path":"/2sf8yOXitROq76irW5Avmj5GpKL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d4400a2a9117f0016efbe9e","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":124219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Dera","original_name":"Charles Dera","popularity":9.895,"profile_path":"/58damZDzIN7LjRns3ucUZQ1NYNg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d4400a8ea7b0e00158a0479","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1731005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Craven Moorehead","original_name":"Craven Moorehead","popularity":1.96,"profile_path":"/q7qf2299QpDYYOA5Jwbk5RaNIbH.jpg","credit_id":"5d4400e2a9117f0016efbeec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1647480,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bree Mills","original_name":"Bree Mills","popularity":2.24,"profile_path":"/ql5DBazbVozMqktpcFv7aby2I0F.jpg","credit_id":"5d4400efb7abb50017498c61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l3nRmpMuvP6AQYpRgki1uLI7xO9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC-17","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
