After massacring the villagers, the marines steal the villages gold, much to the objection of their Vietnamese translator and guide. Skip forward past the credits sequence; it's now 15 years later, and members of the unit are getting murdered one by one. This leads to the former head of the group, now a high ranking military officer, announcing that the only person who is up to the job of finding out the identity of the killer is an Aussie, Major Brad Cooper.","popularity":0.8277,"poster_path":"/k5p197lpMypxcX5BPKb8HCFg5z1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180515,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carl-Phil Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":67972,"logo_path":null,"name":"ECM Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Back To Hell...
