It is the life story of the legendary musician, but it is not a biography, it is a fairytale documentary! The director followed Lee Perry for thirteen years and discovered an unbelievable story, a revelation, told about and with one of the major protagonists of contemporary music, the other half of the story that has never been told. The movie can be seen as a guide for how to change the world with music, with a positive attitude, mindset or, as Lee Perry calls it, vibration.","popularity":0.1075,"poster_path":"/7Kh9NaPgU1vLiteCPwI6x9AIatJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schmid
