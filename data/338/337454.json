Having lost his father when he was only ten years old, Theo is strong and emotionally sound. While searching through his mother's belongings, he stumbles upon a piece of film from around the time when he was born. The footage shows his late father, young and seemingly happy. Soon after, Theo sets out on a quest to find more info about his dad. His search leads him to George Walter, a close friend of his father's. George lives high up in the mountains. He was a bit famous once, but since has become a recluse. When Theo meets George something special happens. It turns out that George was once in love with Theo's dad - so what he sees in Theo is more than just his first love's son. And, in return, what Theo sees in George is more than a route to his father. As the two men spend time together on the mountain, they get to know each other, but even more than that, they get to know themselves.","popularity":0.1199,"poster_path":"/ek76SqaBkvGdeGtZrrNaM4KGU4Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Optimist Films Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2012-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hour of Living","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Fordham","original_name":"Sam Fordham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Theo","credit_id":"553cdf6fc3a3683e55005876","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Heinimann","original_name":"Charlotte Heinimann","popularity":0.2255,"profile_path":"/70yPegzGdt4NUvS8gdldgSzHOsF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gabrielle","credit_id":"553cdf9492514138a90085e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Wade","original_name":"David Wade","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Conrad","credit_id":"553cdfaa92514114350013ed","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1459315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Grant","original_name":"Gary Grant","popularity":0.1454,"profile_path":"/tpU7kJIsa6IT4uSgFHIjPigBunY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Harry","credit_id":"553cdfbcc3a3683e14005849","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Schwegier","original_name":"Christoph Schwegier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Werner","credit_id":"553cdfedc3a368066d0012a7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459311,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sebastian Michael","original_name":"Sebastian Michael","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"553cde6192514114350013cc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459319,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Berzsenyl Bellsagh","original_name":"Adam Berzsenyl Bellsagh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"553ce058c3a3683e1400585d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459311,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sebastian Michael","original_name":"Sebastian Michael","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"553ce0c8c3a3683c48004069","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1922747","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kbiO73jUSAoio1XjKrt55k9GK0g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pnl8F3XnXiGevrjlWewBhUPxtOo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1TMLaANtJO4MLs3yjul0uyO5Xmu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ek76SqaBkvGdeGtZrrNaM4KGU4Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bs7UNBLhGQBS2xM4y93kwkTTBrc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1332,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ndkla6qDtdylgbeIkQef9iKL80m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":970,"name":"parent child relationship"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"THE HOUR OF LIVING - TRAILER (\"FOOLISH\")","key":"35230293","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-01-18T01:22:00.000Z","id":"61978e235c071b00920bc917"}]}}}
