With the added bonus of previously unreleased footage from Arthur’s career – ranging from Desk Sergeant in Dixon of Doc Green, to the one time host of Ask The Family – and a rumour of a surprise start guest appearance, the celebration of Arthur’s illustrious career is a show not to miss.  As Arthur himself says, “Wouldn't it be wonderful if you could just turn the telly on after a hard day at the abattoir…or whatever it is you do… and there I was, smiling back at you, in my own programme again, again.”","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":"/8BDvJLDvr43Z5jPwKW8hmyKZxax.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Komedia Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Count Arthur Strong - The Man Behind The Smile","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Delaney","original_name":"Steve Delaney","popularity":0.1529,"profile_path":"/17ITAyOQSfQdIl4CVhqjXNeH00A.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Count Arthur Strong","credit_id":"5dd751e012aabc00138d59fd","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8BDvJLDvr43Z5jPwKW8hmyKZxax.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11800,"name":"mockumentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Count Arthur Strong: The Man Behind the Smile DVD Trailer","key":"hg2FuD4CoKY","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-03-04T12:08:12.000Z","id":"5dd774d428723c001453e04a"}]}}}
