Using the Pantheon as another practical example, this program explores the concepts of central and intercepted angles, arc segments and chords. The Etude du Cinéma de l’Ecole de Barcelona (a short-lived group that appeared in Spain in the 1960s) offers the opportunity to consider the distrust of the avant-gardes with regard to narrative. The lacunar narration whose principle the School of Barcelona adopts goes against the traditional narrative and its quest for coherence and continuity. She invites the viewer to make the disconcerting experience of unbinding and emptiness. Such an approach involves an ethical posture. The Barcelona School follows in the footsteps of a modernity that intends to move away from an alienating authoritarian discourse and claims to make the spectator a partner in creation.","popularity":0.3769,"poster_path":"/bCnn1TMGGGVxJsTrEbymBg8GnNQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52177,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tibidabo Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circles","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":589555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serena Vergano","original_name":"Serena Vergano","popularity":0.1756,"profile_path":"/iDrdVQPLuZqj5jjq882tekF4NZe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"553db612925141585200223d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salvador Clotas","original_name":"Salvador Clotas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"553db60492514137f90028ea","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romy","original_name":"Romy","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"553db60b92514138a9009c2d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Bofill","original_name":"Ricardo Bofill","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":"/fwtMobOjBjpBPJUx2N7upVEDMm8.jpg","credit_id":"553db5f9c3a3683c48005778","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329433,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jordi Sangenís","original_name":"Jordi Sangenís","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645a5e5477d23b01703816b1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1005622,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Juan Amorós","original_name":"Juan Amorós","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645a5e416aa8e00173810b39","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Bofill","original_name":"Ricardo Bofill","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":"/fwtMobOjBjpBPJUx2N7upVEDMm8.jpg","credit_id":"645a5e2c1b70ae0145ee464d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1090544,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Juan Luis Oliver","original_name":"Juan Luis Oliver","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"645a5e4a3fe160015571de04","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0144832","wikidata_id":"Q69362709","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":846,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ktcvnx6734foYKeAREFlr6y5TRU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1504}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bCnn1TMGGGVxJsTrEbymBg8GnNQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.662,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nsFWk4Mi8vqoVYyUkikao1HLD8a.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":763}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12436,"name":"architecture"},{"id":317459,"name":"experimental movie"},{"id":317465,"name":"escuela de barcelona"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
