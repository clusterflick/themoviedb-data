A late-night radio host takes in calls from citizens expressing their concerns, predictions and speculations on what may happen when—or even if—the sun comes up. Simultaneously, a crisis centre dispatcher fields panicked calls from people experiencing real-life traumatic situations in need of immediate attention. The voices of these callers are interwoven with an intimate therapy session and a wandering taxicab to build a profile of a place where citizens want to be heard. Never showing the callers on the other end of the line, the film creates an aural overview of a darkened city. As the night progresses, the calls continue coming in, revealing the various struggles people are experiencing in dealing with conceptual fears and current woes—all in a world that soon may be over.","popularity":0.6338,"poster_path":"/duQEp7xDGfOy1oV86qcGiqK5PEX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52317,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wajda Studio","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":6480,"logo_path":"/qJUUNzFYXNUDaisssBTV3Zdki9R.png","name":"TVP","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2015-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"End of the World","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1460687,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Monika Pawluczuk","original_name":"Monika Pawluczuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55403da09251414af30007ac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1460687,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Monika Pawluczuk","original_name":"Monika Pawluczuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"554042bcc3a3681d9c000971","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1460700,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Radosław Ochnio","original_name":"Radosław Ochnio","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"554042df9251414aee00091a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1460688,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marcin Latanik","original_name":"Marcin Latanik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55403fab9251413d6d0004b9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1460687,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Monika Pawluczuk","original_name":"Monika Pawluczuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55403d979251414ae80007c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1460689,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katarzyna Ślesicka","original_name":"Katarzyna Ślesicka","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55403fd99251413d6d0004c7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4428967,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Agnieszka Glińska","original_name":"Agnieszka Glińska","popularity":0.1502,"profile_path":"/kHAA2X6AlqMixtRDHzG2DnJiDJw.jpg","credit_id":"657a61b9ec8a4300e09b2973","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936917,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mikołaj Trzaska","original_name":"Mikołaj Trzaska","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef1e59d6e3deb0038a7ee5c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1460695,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michał Dymek","original_name":"Michał Dymek","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/aWwNlIEzjCdVBBsPGhXfX4dgfNi.jpg","credit_id":"5ef1e542d11e0e0037ae3fe6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1460697,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Szymon Lenkowski","original_name":"Szymon Lenkowski","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef1e5816e3deb0035a5ea6f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1460696,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jakub Giza","original_name":"Jakub Giza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef1e5679a8a8a0036b01264","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1460698,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Małgorzata Szyłak","original_name":"Małgorzata Szyłak","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef1e552d11e0e0036af229c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4548732","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/duQEp7xDGfOy1oV86qcGiqK5PEX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6256,"name":"truth"},{"id":2135,"name":"radio"},{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":10150,"name":"end of the world"},{"id":13073,"name":"fear"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":206529,"name":"emergency"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
