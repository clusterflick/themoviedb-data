Sullivan regarded this operetta - a hit ever since its first production in New York in 1879 - as the best comedy he composed. He even said of his collaborator, \"The libretto is ingenious, clever, wonderfully fun in parts and sometimes brilliant in dialogue - beautifully written for music, as is all Gilbert does.\" Indeed, audiences will find the music every bit a match for the lyrics, with the genius of the score lying in its parody of grand opera. Filmed in 1985 at the world-famous Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario.","popularity":0.4559,"poster_path":"/9o4zr8B4yeMs6Av9djNdIYMFIzi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":31092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stratford Festival","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1985-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pirates of Penzance","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1233052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Hyslop","original_name":"Jeff Hyslop","popularity":0.1408,"profile_path":"/sewVk898bQBXzJmyjjmAlG75I2x.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Frederic","credit_id":"55390bac925141275e0016ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brent Carver","original_name":"Brent Carver","popularity":0.1052,"profile_path":"/pUgg4fwYkI8cl7Rf4QXeJf6MLAu.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"The Pirate King","credit_id":"5539189792514140810021c9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caralyn Tomlin","original_name":"Caralyn Tomlin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mabel","credit_id":"55390bd0c3a3687845006aac","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1458211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Chamberlain","original_name":"Douglas Chamberlain","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Maj.
