Set to lines from the Hindu Bhagavad Gita, Satyagraha depicts scenes from the life of Gandhi as he developed his philosophy of non-violent resistance in South Africa between 1896 and 1913. The opera became the second installment of Glass’s Portrait Trilogy, focused on innovators from across history. Satyagraha arrived at the Met during the 2007–08 season, when director Phelim McDermott made his debut with a production that employed everyday materials like newspaper and corrugated tin to create towering puppets and striking tableaus. In 2011, his staging returned, this time recorded live in HD. In this performance, tenor Richard Croft gives a moving performance as Gandhi, leading a remarkable ensemble cast conducted by Dante Anzolini.","popularity":0.508,"poster_path":"/kGER1ColHYsstqIagibkyksTCVd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":184,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Sanskrit","iso_639_1":"sa","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Philip Glass: Satyagraha","video":true,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Great Performances at the Met: Satyagraha","type":"TV title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Croft","original_name":"Richard Croft","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/dh9ujc5SqJrLPJG68cYhb8Apaav.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"M.
