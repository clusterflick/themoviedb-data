She is discovered and taken home to their cave by brothers Dagban and Eric, who vie for her affection in an allegory about “brain vs. brawn.” When “Dagban threatens to do her bodily harm unless she accedes to his intentions” Eric beats up his brother to protect Chloe, and then subsequently leaves the cave he calls home to avoid further conflict. By this point, he has won Chloe’s affection with his kindness and love, and she decides to follow him and “together they continue their journey, seeking happiness in the land beyond the horizon, which joins earth with heaven.”","popularity":0.2873,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cave Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Cave Man; or, Before a Book Was Written","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Ince","original_name":"Ralph Ince","popularity":0.1863,"profile_path":"/73Dd6TNh5Ji2JQsj63JoxJ53sbo.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Eric","credit_id":"553b8a9c9251413f5a005be9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1187868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Storey","original_name":"Edith Storey","popularity":0.1884,"profile_path":"/r8iO5KZFDf3V7o13KWlB67iuWZK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Chloe","credit_id":"553b8aa0925141275e00528c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Northrup","original_name":"Harry Northrup","popularity":0.1244,"profile_path":"/zTH4PU8BGipYly6JuV0BnYz3YX5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dagban","credit_id":"553b8aa992514135c8002025","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose Tapley","original_name":"Rose Tapley","popularity":0.1289,"profile_path":"/rwX3kI8L08zijmf8huOTzeW5QFt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Else","credit_id":"553b8ab0c3a36820ec001afe","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tefft Johnson","original_name":"Tefft Johnson","popularity":0.1436,"profile_path":"/ioAvdqZHSTOSwZcVeNamE0BBAfl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Aleric","credit_id":"553b8ac0925141687400348a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":562261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles L.
