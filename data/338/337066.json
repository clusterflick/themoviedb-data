It is 1943 in Nazi-occupied Denmark. Anett and her parents are hiding a Jewish woman and her son, Carl, in their cellar until a fishing boat can take them across the sound to neutral Sweden.

Worried about their safety, Anett devises a clever and unusual plan for their safe passage to the harbor.","popularity":0.0454,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":47134,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dreamscape Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Whispering Town","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1445719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Cottle","original_name":"Elizabeth Cottle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"55392eefc3a3684c5b00346c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1445696,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eric Martucci","original_name":"Eric Martucci","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55392f20925141275e001a17","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
