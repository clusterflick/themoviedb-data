When Eli's new love interest (Ginger Alden) meets with the disapproval of his unscrupulous and manipulative manager (William T. Hicks), tragedy results, and Eli realizes what he must do to not only save his new relationship but also his life; and he does so in a most dramatic way.  Living Legend features a dynamic original soundtrack performed by the Legendary Roy Orbison.","popularity":0.2746,"poster_path":"/7LHx71sJL4mILsbI1QlSu5kpTxZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living Legend: The King of Rock and Roll","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earl Owensby","original_name":"Earl Owensby","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Eli Canfield","credit_id":"5cdb05ad9251416b5bcf2067","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1058250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William T.
