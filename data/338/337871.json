The scene is the villa apartment almost finished, where the tourist guide mother, father who also works for the second economy and the lonely big girl preparing for her maturity examination turn up alternatively. It is only the teen-ager boy who really \"lives\" in this place: instead of attending school he stays home all day and observes the life of the surrounding by a self-made periscope. Internal communication of the family is accomplished in writing, on the pin-up board in the kitchen.","popularity":0.092,"poster_path":"/w3jv3ECgFWFvk6UR5ofSxdWWo7j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8100,"logo_path":"/1HuVRo0SYPSzYvduxVf4baaWqOI.png","name":"Mafilm","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1986-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love, Mother","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125361,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Róbert Koltai","original_name":"Róbert Koltai","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/kICjJBJpA5JFUMDyWjaLnMyAWXD.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Kalmár Géza","credit_id":"554102b5c3a3681da0001c5e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":123943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorottya Udvaros","original_name":"Dorottya Udvaros","popularity":0.1714,"profile_path":"/xL5wyYlENb4UeXGZy4QjBhC23EF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Kalmár Joli","credit_id":"554102bf9251414ae6001d12","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1460888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katalin Lajtai","original_name":"Katalin Lajtai","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Kalmár Mari","credit_id":"554102cec3a3681da5001d50","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1460889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Gévai","original_name":"Simon Gévai","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Peti Kalmár (as Gévai G.
