The film conceived, but never realized, by Rossellini took shape in his notes after a trip to Chile conducted in May of 1971, a trip made to conduct an interview-portrait of Salvador Allende, then actually carried out by the director of \"Rome, Open City\". October 28, 1971: Rossellini, back from Santiago, Chile, reads a newspaper reports of a beached whale on the Pacific coast near a poor village inhabited by fishermen. From this simple news comes a film script for a fable about wealth and poverty. A film whose shooting Rossellini would have been entrusted to the young student Claudio Bondì, just graduated from the Experimental Center of Cinematography.","popularity":0.0718,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":29202,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2010-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La balena di Rossellini","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"A Baleia, de Roberto Rosselini","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roberto Rossellini","original_name":"Roberto Rossellini","popularity":0.6127,"profile_path":"/dEfCuU0CoIqhgoEDtHZpIoNWNVj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"553d4995c3a368784500d01a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543794,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Renzo Rossellini","original_name":"Renzo Rossellini","popularity":0.171,"profile_path":"/fkSLQkLH0hu9ygN7IUeeuobcFNL.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"57a0de75c3a3684a0f00205c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emidio Greco","original_name":"Emidio Greco","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"553d49b09251413f5a008354","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriano Aprà","original_name":"Adriano Aprà","popularity":0.1408,"profile_path":"/pQHVez81yQSeZaHGSfvufjyI3kk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"553d49bc92514135c80047d2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1283898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enrico Ghezzi","original_name":"Enrico Ghezzi","popularity":0.1199,"profile_path":"/9xeV2Q1z0TtDOVGxG8Mwnc601ka.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"553d49cac3a3685cf8007f63","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Herlitzka","original_name":"Roberto Herlitzka","popularity":0.1771,"profile_path":"/x1rSUKBPPSObnK7GVMHSG3LkQ1u.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"553d49d4c3a36820ec003ffa","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudio Bondi","original_name":"Claudio Bondi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"553d49689251411435001d9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5920260","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
