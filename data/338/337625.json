The DVD recorded in February in Wyspiański Theater (Katowice, Poland), is enriched by a number of additional features, such as interviews with Clive Nolan, Agnieszka Świta, David Clifford, Scott Higham, and Mark Westwood, as also “The Making of Alchemy” material.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alchemy Live","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4344,"name":"musical"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
