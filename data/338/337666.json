Finally, a climbing film without any climbing or narrative in this hysterical analysis of the modern climbing ethic. The onslaught of comedic sketches mirrors the achievements of our heroes. Features a battle scene, super-heroes, villains, insane caricatures, short animations and film parodies. Visually stunning, very funny, and slightly risque.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is a place where heroes wouldn't dare.
