It is May, 2005 in Central Arnhem Land: 'We are making a movie. The story is their story, those that live on this land, in their language, and set a long time before the coming of the Balanda, as we white people are known. For the people of the Arafura Swamp, this film is an opportunity, maybe a last chance to hold on to the old ways. For all of us, the challenges are unexpected, the task beyond anything imagined. For me, it is the most difficult film I have made, in the most foreign land I've been to...and it is Australia.' - Rolf de Heer","popularity":0.0809,"poster_path":"/vE3Ux3XmCU9bdULYLwDH1yLRV39.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2006-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Balanda and the Bark Canoes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rolf de Heer","original_name":"Rolf de Heer","popularity":0.1187,"profile_path":"/uYuZHvUvMkQAySlP0sTuglWqvAX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self - Narrator","credit_id":"64065cb10816c700811878a6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rolf de Heer","original_name":"Rolf de Heer","popularity":0.1187,"profile_path":"/uYuZHvUvMkQAySlP0sTuglWqvAX.jpg","credit_id":"553c4bc4c3a3683e55004971","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":112683,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tania Nehme","original_name":"Tania Nehme","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"553c4bd19251412c2700214d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1362262,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Molly Reynolds","original_name":"Molly Reynolds","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/6ifMchnTCnZT6IOlO84SpR5nFfQ.jpg","credit_id":"553c4be492514137f9000497","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rolf de Heer","original_name":"Rolf de Heer","popularity":0.1187,"profile_path":"/uYuZHvUvMkQAySlP0sTuglWqvAX.jpg","credit_id":"64065c9a160e7300b804199a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rolf de Heer","original_name":"Rolf de Heer","popularity":0.1187,"profile_path":"/uYuZHvUvMkQAySlP0sTuglWqvAX.jpg","credit_id":"64065ca9160e730093d5446b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0823172","wikidata_id":"Q123288914","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1407,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vE3Ux3XmCU9bdULYLwDH1yLRV39.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
