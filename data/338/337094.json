To make sure that \"those out there don´t think two nuns no longer make a convent\", they try to keep up a full range of activities. The women´s headstrong character and their stubborn insistence on autonomy and self-dependency creates situations that are both touching and funny, and entirely unexpected in a place like this.","popularity":0.0696,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":51885,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carmen Tartarotti Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Cannot Dream a Bright Blue Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458301,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmen Tartarotti","original_name":"Carmen Tartarotti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"553951d6c3a3685cf8001e40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":"Q20978675","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
