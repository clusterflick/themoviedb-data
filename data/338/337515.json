When a mysterious stranger, Jerome, shows up claiming to have been his best friend in the Air Force Police, Bob's peaceful existence begins to unravel from the outside in. Bob's entire family is caught in the storm -- but none more than Bob's eight year-old daughter, Charlotte, who discovers that she might hold the key to conjuring Bob's forgotten past. As Charlotte comes to learn, \"every time something happens that knocks us out of balance, we try doing something that will knock us back in...\" That universal theme of balance is the soul of REPARATION.","popularity":1.3663,"poster_path":"/7nCpLB5BItpot7QvmU0s3JPYcyV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reparation Films LLC","origin_country":""},{"id":81455,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Dirt Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Duty and friendship collide","title":"Reparation","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Huertas","original_name":"Jon Huertas","popularity":0.7679,"profile_path":"/fNNJu1SJLQlpD8LVFFGJw1JlQSn.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Jerome","credit_id":"57dcc7659251410d8c00035a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Menchaca","original_name":"Marc Menchaca","popularity":0.901,"profile_path":"/fL0LmdBwau30M4AFPVJrpLRXXsU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bob","credit_id":"57dcc771c3a368625800037f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":804206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Newcomb","original_name":"Virginia Newcomb","popularity":0.1368,"profile_path":"/xdin5aWu7H3SI46fFeC9lCNpwUO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lucy","credit_id":"57dcc77dc3a36862290002ca","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Szarabajka","original_name":"Keith Szarabajka","popularity":0.7357,"profile_path":"/z45Goe7lfBvs3cBP5igsCE8ISWG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Col.
