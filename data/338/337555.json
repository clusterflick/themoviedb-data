It's a secret history of transport cafes, transit vans, B&Bs, sleepless roadies and of loved ones left at home or, on one occasion, by the roadside. Also audiences both good and bad, and the gigs themselves - from the early variety package to the head clubs, the stadiums, and the pubs.","popularity":0.371,"poster_path":"/uEHxoQJF5dPHodqmN5d5ta6xwJj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tales from the Tour Bus: Rock 'n' Roll on the Road","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Wakeman","original_name":"Rick Wakeman","popularity":0.207,"profile_path":"/mv3YhykDvvbDZLnREKfmSJ4EpHJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Presenter","credit_id":"60e303aa880551005d41a90d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3146729,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laura Hartley","original_name":"Laura Hartley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60e3033b1e922500462ae60c","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Rodley","original_name":"Chris Rodley","popularity":0.1354,"profile_path":"/68s5Da7VJ8vcoUG3b4WWyq1jRDP.jpg","credit_id":"60e302dddb154f005e4a60d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":202417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Cooper","original_name":"Mark Cooper","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/l5xmotx7X1JVUQgwmgU60pnIOPB.jpg","credit_id":"64fa3e584ccc501869d6d1e3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4638152","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oeGJvPHCtZyNbeBF49uWfieNEtw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uEHxoQJF5dPHodqmN5d5ta6xwJj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11700,"name":"rock music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BBC4","release_date":"2015-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
