Porter, the film starred Gladys Hulette as Alice. Being a silent film, naturally all of Lewis Carroll's nonsensical prose could not be used, and, being only a one-reel picture, most of Carroll's memorable characters in his original 1865 novel similarly could not be included. What was used in the film was faithful in spirit to Carroll, and in design to the original John Tenniel illustrations. Variety complimented the picture by comparing it favorably to the \"foreign\" film fantasies then flooding American cinemas.","popularity":0.3451,"poster_path":"/f1qshRxJygp7zhjPwaFU6QDAgcf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1910-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Hulette","original_name":"Gladys Hulette","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/uvsTd2w1s52CRePbptkMzBBNsm3.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Alice","credit_id":"553a42ce9251413f5a003bdc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yale Boss","original_name":"Yale Boss","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/zpjGvSXtYKejqylKaFp5w6zD5Gk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mad Hatter","credit_id":"62f5e596498bc20084f9ee3b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44866,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edwin S.
