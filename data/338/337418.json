Called back from Moscow on a search for a missing person, this is a story of a man forced to plunge into the past, reminded at every turn of the previous life he led in Saint Petersburg. He must come to terms with the present to move forward - and on top of it all, he's not even sure he's awake. The over-arching presence of St Petersburg, sometimes benign, sometimes threatening, bears witness to his journey.","popularity":0.1192,"poster_path":"/n9FepU1cgmPOseFtjwjRivghe9k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2014-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A White White Night","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Belaya belaya noch","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3317688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Artyom Tsypin","original_name":"Артём Цыпин","popularity":0.0988,"profile_path":"/vzdUW692r6V9WWFBrZPR4pz6ABU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64955d6ad236e600c7793ff2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Barkovsky","original_name":"Сергей Барковский","popularity":0.2044,"profile_path":"/jojs842Z8tj53Dm0yV4SPXULOM0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64955d788805510125987825","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2979308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irina Obrezkova","original_name":"Ирина Обрезкова","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64955d7ed236e6011e09f0ad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1687746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dmitriy Vorobyov","original_name":"Дмитрий Воробьев","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":"/2A1AHfMUAe4Sfl5hzVwtJYDWlnq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64955d8597eab40127ffcb97","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2128036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alla Emintseva","original_name":"Алла Еминцева","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/klpTLFlMEvXXZUyjDq5hwqcPaO3.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64955d8e88055100e7445df9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1118329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuriy Orlov","original_name":"Юрий Орлов","popularity":0.174,"profile_path":"/t5HAOSqCm9dkYT0VrZg5H3jvNSf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"64955d9697eab40127ffcba9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2106153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatyana Tarasova","original_name":"Tatyana Tarasova","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/40XHiXzehmiW88PFrmOlW9d35fP.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"64955d9e391b9c0126135778","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1773703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyubov Tishchenko","original_name":"Любовь Тищенко","popularity":0.0754,"profile_path":"/7ORuy2DgI1CDkby2NiVXkwDijeb.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"64955da897eab40108534fdf","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2936069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Svetlana Obidina","original_name":"Светлана Обидина","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/zRTaYy650wSJnmOHguAvxzT9SJo.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"64955db1a284eb00e2b6fb3e","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1134933,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elena Dolgopyat","original_name":"Elena Dolgopyat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64955c2e97eab40108534eef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1424255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ramil Salakhutdinov","original_name":"Ramil Salakhutdinov","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64955be7a284eb00c5bd484a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1424255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ramil Salakhutdinov","original_name":"Ramil Salakhutdinov","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64955c26d236e6013bc51beb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4312900","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n9FepU1cgmPOseFtjwjRivghe9k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
