The name is that of the village in Northern Mozambique where in 1960 it took place. The Portuguese colonial regime did the killing. In independent Mozambique, those inhabitants of Mueda who survived regularly re-enact the massacre in situ. They themselves play the roles of victims, assassins, and spectators. Ruy Guerra, now a Brazilian but born in Lourenço Marques (now Maputo, the capital of Mozambique), filmed this extraordinary creation of liberated popular culture, intercutting it with first-hand interviews on the massacre. The mix is compelling, and the grave yet joyous spectacle unique.","popularity":0.4001,"poster_path":"/a8HylDQ70aaG6xdOJpfdu3ApqL8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178289,"logo_path":null,"name":"Instituto Nacional de Cinema de Moçambique","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MZ","name":"Mozambique"}],"release_date":"1982-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mueda, Memory and Massacre","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romao Canapoquele","original_name":"Romao Canapoquele","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"553acacd9251411256008639","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Filipe Gunoguacala","original_name":"Filipe Gunoguacala","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"553acad9925141125600863e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mauricio Machimbuco","original_name":"Mauricio Machimbuco","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"553acae7c3a3683e550021c2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baltazar Nchilema","original_name":"Baltazar Nchilema","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"553acaf592514135c8000ceb","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612531,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacques Schwarztein","original_name":"Jacques Schwarztein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c43b764e4dff004dfcd7c1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2710335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camilo De Sousa","original_name":"Camilo De Sousa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c43b36544c411449fb3776","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458748,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Calisto Dos Lagos","original_name":"Calisto Dos Lagos","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"553aca91925141651800bf05","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20548,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruy Guerra","original_name":"Ruy Guerra","popularity":0.1239,"profile_path":"/2LquH5BGqnkge6axUGK1IRKEpfF.jpg","credit_id":"553aca7f9251411256008633","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20548,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruy Guerra","original_name":"Ruy Guerra","popularity":0.1239,"profile_path":"/2LquH5BGqnkge6axUGK1IRKEpfF.jpg","credit_id":"58bda992c3a3680df8003fcd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20548,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruy Guerra","original_name":"Ruy Guerra","popularity":0.1239,"profile_path":"/2LquH5BGqnkge6axUGK1IRKEpfF.jpg","credit_id":"58bda96fc3a368668604826f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0081194","wikidata_id":"Q16665483","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/a8HylDQ70aaG6xdOJpfdu3ApqL8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/eSe1Jh5K7Z7TV9FMfuOoUAS5Zi8.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":409,"name":"africa"},{"id":1583,"name":"mass murder"},{"id":197165,"name":"mozambique"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Tashkent)","release_date":"1980-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
