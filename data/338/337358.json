When Alfa (French rapper Stomy Bugsy) kills his drug-dealer boss in retaliation for a friend’s death, his brother cryptically suggests he leave Paris and “go toward the river.” Accompanied by sassy Senegalese cousin Marie (Auriele Coulibay), he embarks on a road trip back to his disdained African roots. Pic possesses a picaresque charm, plus feisty persona of Marie. But Bugsy is so unflaggingly morose, it’s hard to understand what Marie sees in him. Pic, yet to find a distrib in France, stands little chance in the U.S.","popularity":0.1309,"poster_path":"/1SmTev3kyUecxSqvu9f4S6SGnyQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GN","name":"Guinea"},{"iso_3166_1":"SN","name":"Senegal"}],"release_date":"2003-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The River","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stomy Bugsy","original_name":"Stomy Bugsy","popularity":0.1918,"profile_path":"/rZ7SlC2vXs08vUEd5XOqfnqrRjg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Alfa","credit_id":"553bcb86c3a3683e55003d1d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Byrd Le Sage","original_name":"Vincent Byrd Le Sage","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":"/q9FWT39B7XpuN3iYaHsNi2JqK6L.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Michel","credit_id":"553bcba49251416874003a43","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1459014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aurélie Coulibaly","original_name":"Aurélie Coulibaly","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"553bcbcc9251411256009ed5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1459015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doc Gynéco","original_name":"Doc Gynéco","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":"/nbNIXFMrYDiOTEK7ZLRZPxR9I1P.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Zeka","credit_id":"553bcbe4c3a3683e14003b44","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4030741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Capucine Ackermann","original_name":"Capucine Ackermann","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":"/xmSGYpQMkKrFLEcvlM8ergs9lLb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64498b1d2fdec60514a124c3","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1126638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mama Keïta","original_name":"Mama Keïta","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"553bcb48c3a36820ec001fd6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0361626","wikidata_id":"Q116256662","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1SmTev3kyUecxSqvu9f4S6SGnyQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
