Over the course of three years--and three tours--he interviews the groups he performs with and questions why they are following the same frustrating path. Struggling with the reality of working a nine-to-five job and the desire to be a full-time musician, he examines why he chose such an unpopular genre of music. As he tours with more successful bands he begins to uncover the true meaning of success and why these bands take such big risks. Includes interviews with Lamb of God, Gojira, Richard Christy and many more.","popularity":0.1622,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why You Do This","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":112235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy Blythe","original_name":"Randy Blythe","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":"/ftPjIGH3dA9qcvBwIfXwbbTsoTs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself -
