Performances made without rehearsal, under the blaring Iraqi sun, with a destroyed city, the distraction of gunfire and bursting mortar shells forming a frightening backdrop. American culture came into Iraq, wired into its tanks and helicopters - a live soundtrack to war, with lyrics such as Let The Bodies Hit The Floor, Round Out, The Tank and Bombs over Baghdad, being memorised by every soldier and forever linked to the violent events they accompanied. As the war extended into a second year, many started writing and performing their own songs. It was rock, rap &amp; roll.","popularity":0.2826,"poster_path":"/xme4c9tVLbUZjhFzeL51FhspQSm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51365,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gittoes & Dalton Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2005-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soundtrack to War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Gittoes","original_name":"George Gittoes","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc95c01c3a368744380e71c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0470161","wikidata_id":"Q7564994","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xme4c9tVLbUZjhFzeL51FhspQSm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15087,"name":"iraq war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
