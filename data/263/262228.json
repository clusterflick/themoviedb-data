When Amelia is teased because her family is taking the missionary discussions, she learns from Alma – as he defends Abinadi against King Noah – to have the faith to stand up for what is right. In this story, Alma (Dallyn Vail Bayles) is faced with the decision of approaching King Noah (Frank Gerrish) and his wicked priests, or risking his live by standing up for the prophet Abinadi (Ken Eklof).  Also starring Michael Birkeland and Brad Warwood, Alma and King Noah’s Court is the fourth episode in the Liken series.","popularity":0.1297,"poster_path":"/6Ns6MGlAm3DEyPNYHDFyx45kxlM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13539,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lightstone Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alma & King Noah's Court","video":true,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Alma and King Noah's Court","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1134358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Eklof","original_name":"Ken Eklof","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Abinidi","credit_id":"5fd27c6122931a003f6d48ba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2734021,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dallyn Vail Bayles","original_name":"Dallyn Vail Bayles","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Alma","credit_id":"5fd27c831fd36f004097cb8e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Gerrish","original_name":"Frank Gerrish","popularity":0.0889,"profile_path":"/ysDvZs98wjiVUZh9rnyvasz0ukH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"King Noah","credit_id":"5fd27ca5363909003cc0e4a0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1829619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Faber","original_name":"Lauren Faber","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Amelia","credit_id":"5fd27cfbd7cd06003e7f0c95","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2888911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brad Warwood","original_name":"Brad Warwood","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"McKay Anderson","credit_id":"5fd27d334df291003cd0cdd9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garrett Summers","original_name":"Garrett Summers","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Spencer","credit_id":"5fd27d48325a51003d7475ff","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dennis Agle Jr.","original_name":"Dennis Agle Jr.","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/tRC86l3al8Q1IimU5RXY3YOaJty.jpg","credit_id":"5fd27c446c84d6003f35dcce","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1137547,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron Edson","original_name":"Aaron Edson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fd27c314b0c630042da39d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137546,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dennis Agle Jr.","original_name":"Dennis Agle Jr.","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/tRC86l3al8Q1IimU5RXY3YOaJty.jpg","credit_id":"5fd27c20d18fb9003ff9f87c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0473437","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Ns6MGlAm3DEyPNYHDFyx45kxlM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
