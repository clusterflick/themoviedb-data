Again hard places played against drifting sounds from unseen sites beyond the image; the images and sounds, repeated, become inflections of each other. But this time there are historical inflections; Rousseau's film, like Straub's, takes place in a sort of meta-history as characters and ancient sites each become products of outside light and shadow.","popularity":0.155,"poster_path":"/go0KBp3XGcwLwC1HL7PozTKNNYZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15261,"logo_path":"/wgKSrQW5yw07bT1TR0iTRO6FD2d.png","name":"Capricci Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1989-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Antiquities of Rome","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Claude Rousseau","original_name":"Jean-Claude Rousseau","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/rA7KgE9IrUnUK7HFaoA9cKeg5Xn.jpg","credit_id":"533a2d5fc3a3680e6900720a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0256604","wikidata_id":"Q3830809","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/go0KBp3XGcwLwC1HL7PozTKNNYZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/n3hivaKPC8fRMXuaNvZQPMmyWDZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":588,"name":"rome, italy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Scratch projection","release_date":"1989-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
