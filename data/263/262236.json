During the war, Field Photo made at least 87 documentaries, many with Ford's signature attention to heroism and loss, and many from the point of view of the fighting soldier and sailor. Talking heads discuss Ford's life and personality, the ways that the war gave him fulfillment, and the ways that his war films embodied the same values and conflicts that his Hollywood films did. Among the films profiled are \"Battle of Midway,\" \"Torpedo Squadron,\" \"Sexual Hygiene,\" and \"December 7.\"","popularity":1.8158,"poster_path":"/xzzNdvgmtukVyCdKZwCGKX8G3dr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4414,"logo_path":null,"name":"FBN Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Ford Goes to War","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kris Kristofferson","original_name":"Kris Kristofferson","popularity":0.9154,"profile_path":"/fWZCpnXT7sLOdc96Bm66QTOjnXZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"62e2877bafe2240067044038","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Bogdanovich","original_name":"Peter Bogdanovich","popularity":0.8766,"profile_path":"/m3aMMYzzEbqKEwGOyEPq7Rt1gAj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"62e287adafe224004ca73c22","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Stone","original_name":"Oliver Stone","popularity":1.2011,"profile_path":"/nPFtjueZHmU56boVKXEvAoQOTWf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"62e290b7e18e3f027943209b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Sarris","original_name":"Andrew Sarris","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"62e290e45ca7042d0a2222b3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonard Maltin","original_name":"Leonard Maltin","popularity":0.1889,"profile_path":"/5jQo1L8Vv10nZQQeMgSaCjLxJlB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self - Interviewee","credit_id":"62e29142e9da692ced939ce3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"F.
