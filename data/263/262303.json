Today, it is the fastest growing segment of the food industry attracting all of the major food corporations. THE NEW GREEN GIANTS looks at a number of these new and old organic corporations and shows how they are managing, or in some cases, failing to live up to the idealistic dreams first espoused by the back-to-the land folk of the late sixties and early seventies.\r The documentary also looks at some of the bigger questions surrounding organic food. Is it really healthier? Is it truly organic? Is it possible to grow from a mom-and-pop operation to become a huge supplier of major grocery chains? Is it actually sustainable? Is it realistic to think the world can be fed organically?","popularity":0.6569,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Examining the complex and controversial world of today's exploding organic food industry.","title":"The New Green Giants","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305966,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Kines","original_name":"Andrew Kines","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"533978b8c3a3680e8f006156","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":220954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ted Remerowski","original_name":"Ted Remerowski","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"533978acc3a3680e96005e4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305967,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Neville Ottey","original_name":"Neville Ottey","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"533978d8c3a3680e96005e4f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10637,"name":"food"},{"id":18380,"name":"organic"},{"id":40842,"name":"organic food"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The New Green Giants - Doc Zone | CBC","key":"78C4SFX-U7U","published_at":"2012-09-06T19:23:35.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"533ec730c3a368544800c08f"}]}}}
