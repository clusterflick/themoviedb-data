But Ines suffers from her childlessness. Then she is confronted with a chapter of her life that has displaced her for many years: In a new student she recognizes her daughter, who she had released after adoption for adoption. Since Boris knows nothing about it, Ines can only trust her best friend Simone. Against her advice, she also seeks in private the proximity to the unsuspecting student. In doing so, she finds herself in a conflict between her responsibility as a teacher and her growing motherly feelings.","popularity":0.4006,"poster_path":"/ayVRLpwbAhqdOITC2yzETkOFtKk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alles für meine Tochter","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann-Kathrin Kramer","original_name":"Ann-Kathrin Kramer","popularity":0.2808,"profile_path":"/kcZNmkiD3J7CP792iNvelRE33av.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ines Erdmann","credit_id":"533c717a92514175fd0002b4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":572648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alicia von Rittberg","original_name":"Alicia von Rittberg","popularity":0.4382,"profile_path":"/3cSEvGUxRm2O1xkIuXoebegDVoF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Clara Liebner","credit_id":"533c7193925141760b00034f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Gastdorf","original_name":"Johanna Gastdorf","popularity":0.3667,"profile_path":"/bIUOlSi3YDLFY5Xncdhl9tqPQGk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kathrin Liebner","credit_id":"533c71c692514176060002f0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elena Uhlig","original_name":"Elena Uhlig","popularity":0.2691,"profile_path":"/pVHCH8pWlCrxtBP17jINFdArWvZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Simone","credit_id":"533c71ed92514176000002e8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans-Jochen Wagner","original_name":"Hans-Jochen Wagner","popularity":0.2991,"profile_path":"/8Rb0EeRXhqzpY5E6XyC5fcHQyQn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Boris Erdmann","credit_id":"533c720792514175fa0002cc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernhard Schütz","original_name":"Bernhard Schütz","popularity":0.2127,"profile_path":"/h3sRpqPmAHkcG5ifYfiRvArEV46.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Erik Liebner","credit_id":"533c724392514175f4000301","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felix Eitner","original_name":"Felix Eitner","popularity":0.1608,"profile_path":"/bioM6ihJ21mkKTzX33VIAFNu9Rf.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Rudi","credit_id":"533c725d925141760b000363","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dieter Brandecker","original_name":"Dieter Brandecker","popularity":0.2038,"profile_path":"/sUiHul8O8Sqqci8KNRem4IGILdV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Rektor","credit_id":"533c727a925141760b000365","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":929967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Beerhold","original_name":"Julia Beerhold","popularity":0.1857,"profile_path":"/lfIMmfgRncwCZoRs5O2GTvUy71i.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Frau Jülich","credit_id":"533c72af92514176000002f8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1796103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martina Servatius","original_name":"Martina Servatius","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/3WmxBuMT5UERkIYVHLCPgSv0lq0.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Ärztin","credit_id":"59164185c3a368423c0259bd","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Heisig","original_name":"René Heisig","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"533c7165925141760b00034a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2854996","wikidata_id":"Q15263369","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yWegMxUDGlgLV1WcsgOf1wM6KiI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ayVRLpwbAhqdOITC2yzETkOFtKk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
