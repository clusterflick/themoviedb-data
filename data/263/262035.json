A short docu-fiction in the enigmatic, associative narrative style typical for this award winning South Indian director. This film by Tiger Award winner (in the category short film) contemplates in a very exciting visual manner on one of the taboo subjects in India - female menstruation and its connection with Hindu rites and beliefs. While in Brahmin Orthodox culture the period of menstruation is considered to be impure and women are not supposed to cook or touch any food prepared for other family members, the main character in this film evokes old menstrual rituals and places them in ancient Indian culture.","popularity":0.1206,"poster_path":"/97rimty09222NkVjpWPymhFx5bI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Flowering Tree","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Poomaram","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1399177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kani Kusruti","original_name":"Kani Kusruti","popularity":0.3501,"profile_path":"/8WCuR3HcPYBeS2tQusFTEl596hM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67e4462b7b7313b5aef0c536","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1296937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vipin Vijay","original_name":"Vipin Vijay","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/osQPtZJv1KHH7EX6oPfLTJSylRU.jpg","credit_id":"53376e569251417daa001a5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3153264","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":972,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4whALqE7cni7ZvWkgBfBCUGaMDz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/97rimty09222NkVjpWPymhFx5bI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
