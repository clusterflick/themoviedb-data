All the other Jews have left a long time ago. Isaac and Zabulon live alone in the abandoned synagogue. The older of the two, the ruddy-faced Isaac, is Kabul’s sorcerer-healer. He makes cabalistic amulets, which he sells to Muslims to drive out demons from women, or from soldiers exhausted by the war. The other Jew, Zabulon, has the same Afghan customers, but sells them the wine, which he produces illegally.","popularity":0.1205,"poster_path":"/cP9LprF3WDuy6RoGXrkKW7AbKfV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30547,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Factory","origin_country":""},{"id":30549,"logo_path":"/rkCemV1ETyTrYoifKX9fS6bi5XL.png","name":"Luna Blue Film","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cabal in Kabul","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Kabala w Kabulu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305965,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dan Alexe","original_name":"Dan Alexe","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"533977a39251417dad004739","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1165571,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Frédéric Fichefet","original_name":"Frédéric Fichefet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b1710fba6250504d5766b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1738866,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dominique Vieillard","original_name":"Dominique Vieillard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bLo14hwncoPzVjfPQElBC8z3eIX.jpg","credit_id":"644b1746336e010541731131","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1848048,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hortense Quitard","original_name":"Hortense Quitard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b1783fea0d702fb14450a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355026,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Serge Kestemont","original_name":"Serge Kestemont","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b176e596a91057957835e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355027,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank Eskenazi","original_name":"Frank Eskenazi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"644b1776fba625052ed5782e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0970925","wikidata_id":"Q29580990","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aVPZqNBEuAKX54LcAmuD96XzQHS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/78PfSzBKofs9LCyAGs0wMSR1sXJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/rrfH2KdffAHPOLbcq7YHJVXLZVg.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":504},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/cP9LprF3WDuy6RoGXrkKW7AbKfV.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
