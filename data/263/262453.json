His findings suggested that the collective hordes of emotive Dianaphiles sobbing in the streets were not only encouraged but emulated by the media. In the aftermath of Diana's death a three-line whip was enforced on newspapers and on TV, selling the sainthood line wholesale. The suspicion was that journalists, like the public, greeted the death as a chance to wax emotional in print, as a change from the customary knowing cynicism, to wheel out all those portentous phrases they'd been saving up for the big occasion. Sadly, they just seemed to be showboating; the eulogies, laments and tear-soaked platitudes ringing risibly hollow.","popularity":1.4911,"poster_path":"/voaSFWLJt8jfRKMwcJF5s8J8tV3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1998-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A complete suspension of reality by the British people.","title":"Princess Diana: The Mourning After","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99401,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Hitchens","original_name":"Christopher Hitchens","popularity":0.1508,"profile_path":"/ntK4rpy6Y0I6bicILVC6ZkIa7d5.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5339e9b99251417dad004dc0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1482404,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Soldinger","original_name":"Mark Soldinger","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5ace745690b55651fe5588","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1954382","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/voaSFWLJt8jfRKMwcJF5s8J8tV3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":917,"name":"journalism"},{"id":161292,"name":"mass hysteria"},{"id":179428,"name":"censorship"},{"id":199781,"name":"uncritical royalists"},{"id":199783,"name":"cult of celebrity"},{"id":300091,"name":"princess diana"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
