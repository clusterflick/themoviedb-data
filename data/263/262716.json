Pop songs tumble out of the jukebox, there is football on the TV, and the eight men lark around, pint glasses in hand. But their blokish fun is balanced on a knife-edge of tension, for beneath the mateyness lurks a disturbing undercurrent of paranoia and insecurity, where weakness is brutally exploited and violence covers up vulnerability.","popularity":0.4097,"poster_path":"/lADQRwxCrBO9h9oKmRnciHGowDv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38242,"logo_path":null,"name":"RM
