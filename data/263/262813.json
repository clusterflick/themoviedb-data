They may have lost their virginity, refused an arranged marriage or left an abusive husband. Even if a woman is raped or merely the victim of gossip, she must pay the price.  Crimes of Honour documents the terrible reality of femicide – the belief that a girl’s body is the property of the family, and any suggestion of sexual impropriety must be cleansed with her blood.  We meet women in hiding from their families, a brother who describes his reasons for killing the sister he loved, and a handful of women who have committed themselves to the protection of young women in danger of losing their lives.","popularity":0.7606,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":80438,"logo_path":null,"name":"BISHARI Film Productions Inc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crimes of Honour","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olympia Dukakis","original_name":"Olympia Dukakis","popularity":0.6492,"profile_path":"/pwoIzB9QSjKkWORQ7SpetnxFizf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"57b319999251412726000323","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olympia Dukakis","original_name":"Olympia Dukakis","popularity":0.6492,"profile_path":"/pwoIzB9QSjKkWORQ7SpetnxFizf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"57b319b5925141182f002701","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1666982,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shelley Saywell","original_name":"Shelley Saywell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b3190ec3a368353400a607","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0220376","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187,"name":"islam"},{"id":18339,"name":"human rights"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":191365,"name":"honor killing"},{"id":199844,"name":"femicide"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Crimes of Honour","key":"b0c0XVI1BpM","published_at":"2007-07-06T19:20:07.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec730c3a368544800c0bd"}]}}}
