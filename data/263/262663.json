Here he brings timepieces of all kinds to run, while his own life is at a standstill. This changes with the visit of his brother Klaus, who demands the beneficial part of the business. In order to prevent the imminent sale of the old-established shop, Rudolf resorts to the white lie. He spends his colleague Karina as his pregnant bride. Because a newly founded family can not escape the economic basis!  In this comedy, Katja Weitzenböck and Johannes Herrschmann fall so in love with each other that time stands
