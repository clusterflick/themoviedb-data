What happens when we set aside our individuality to act collectively? This documentary observes the passions that draw thousands of people close in order to join in a choral character. It discovers the crowd while it transgresses and experiences catharsis, while it seeks miracles and hopes; in continuous movement it splits and rejoins... until they dissipate and individuals re-emerge in their own solitude.","popularity":0.3721,"poster_path":"/3QkknByjM9RyrHeK7CB4GxJ2ANx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2016-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crowds","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Riera","original_name":"Pablo Riera","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Director","credit_id":"533759d3c3a3680e76001d98","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Riera","original_name":"Pablo Riera","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53375a39c3a3680e9f001c79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vasco Elola","original_name":"Vasco Elola","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53375a789251417d9e001634","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305582,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Micaela Solé","original_name":"Micaela Solé","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53375a919251417da1001719","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Horacio Gómez","original_name":"Horacio Gómez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53375aa49251417da70016b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ferrucco Musitelli","original_name":"Ferrucco Musitelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53375aba9251417da70016c0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305585,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eulalie Korenfeld","original_name":"Eulalie Korenfeld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53375ae09251417da1001728","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2235653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Ramos","original_name":"Pablo Ramos","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660caa65c8a5ac017c7a3cef","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2235653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Ramos","original_name":"Pablo Ramos","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660caab115dea0014932c600","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2235653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pablo Ramos","original_name":"Pablo Ramos","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660cc33fe039f10162e5863a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1582456,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Emiliano Mazza De Luca","original_name":"Emiliano Mazza De Luca","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/mnnHe28YpWDeAkVcJ7FwU0f6LGL.jpg","credit_id":"66a3e98cba2628ba16ad4a8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3203476,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Mónica Talamas","original_name":"Mónica Talamas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a3e9b28c1887ade4482ffe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2400401","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3QkknByjM9RyrHeK7CB4GxJ2ANx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":679}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13042,"name":"football (soccer)"},{"id":40905,"name":"cheering crowd"},{"id":164290,"name":"crowd"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
