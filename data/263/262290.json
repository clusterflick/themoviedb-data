Indians attack Morrowbie's caravan and he becomes separated from his wife. He walks alone through the open frontier, searching for her, when he wanders into a remote colony in the forest for the mentally ill. Once in the colony, no one can leave; a mysterious and fearsome army soldier guards the boundary between the colony and freedom. With the fate of his wife looming, Morrowbie must attempt the impossible: escape.","popularity":0.4445,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"On
