The 2500-year-old drama of the woman who defied the state to bury her brother is transformed through stark, ceaseless movement, haunting sounds and music (including themes from Glen Branca, David Van Tieghem, Elliot Sharp and Diamanda Galas) and words of outcry against our own world's injustice.","popularity":0.424,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":212149,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eclipse Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antigone/Rites of Passion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Howard","original_name":"Alan Howard","popularity":0.3426,"profile_path":"/jYHkGkFzRGrVRoX568Omr3ipmde.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Haemon & Polynices (voice)","credit_id":"5eb9184f0cb3350021ce549d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1095415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bertram Ross","original_name":"Bertram Ross","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Oedipus","credit_id":"67d589bf9165f371180120b3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":151409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janet Eilber","original_name":"Janet Eilber","popularity":0.1941,"profile_path":"/2ocyX7elE2JP8k4ijWKNXlF7Bcb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ismene","credit_id":"67d589ea790d78633a013508","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1531461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amy Greenfield","original_name":"Amy Greenfield","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Antigone","credit_id":"67d58a2b24b7ebc3767baab5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5306111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Montes","original_name":"Henry Montes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Polynices","credit_id":"67d58b5925f01d54167bad37","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5306112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvio Facchin","original_name":"Silvio Facchin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Eteocles","credit_id":"67d58b6e5963ebffde7bbca4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris McGiver","original_name":"Boris McGiver","popularity":0.5051,"profile_path":"/mwVp5Pt7gMhEHPsijU8niPRljiW.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Guard","credit_id":"67d58bb025f01d54167bad55","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5306116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Villani","original_name":"Eric Villani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Guard","credit_id":"67d58bc4577665ace5f16df3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5306118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lochren","original_name":"Robert Lochren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Guard","credit_id":"67d58bf4790d78633a01364c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2926742,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rick Gioia","original_name":"Rick Gioia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Guard","credit_id":"67d58c4824b7ebc3767bab33","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5306121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Maudlin","original_name":"Kenneth Maudlin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Guard","credit_id":"67d58c6031538de608f17238","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1237102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maeve Kinkead","original_name":"Maeve Kinkead","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Ismene (voice)","credit_id":"67d58c9b790d78633a013678","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1531461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amy Greenfield","original_name":"Amy Greenfield","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576f0e4092514119b700043d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1206475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diamanda Galás","original_name":"Diamanda Galás","popularity":0.0803,"profile_path":"/jeI7QjZlhaq3oxwkkI08TDgwmK0.jpg","credit_id":"666f4dc4409c3a294debfff1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0331423","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
