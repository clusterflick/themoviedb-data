Although 40% of the province's population spoke French, they had been unable to make their voices heard. The movement started with students-sit-ins, demonstrations against Parliament, run-ins with the police - and soon spread to a majority of Acadians. The film captures the behind-the-scenes action and the students' determination to bring about change. An invaluable document of the rebirth of a people.","popularity":0.3714,"poster_path":"/duXi8LCXZXUNpcIxkPuja7PD93i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1971-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Acadia Acadia?!?","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"L'Acadie, l'Acadie","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1662174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Blanchard","original_name":"Michel Blanchard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Student","credit_id":"57a5540c9251410eb1000e3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1662176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Régis Brown","original_name":"Régis Brown","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self - Student","credit_id":"57a5541e9251411b760086b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1662178,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean Cormier","original_name":"Jean Cormier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self - Student","credit_id":"57a55435c3a3682e70000ef8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1662179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irène Doiron","original_name":"Irène Doiron","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self - Student","credit_id":"57a554489251410f03000f4f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1662180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Gauvin","original_name":"Bernard Gauvin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self - Student","credit_id":"57a55458925141100200376f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1662181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blondine Maurice","original_name":"Blondine Maurice","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self - Student","credit_id":"57a554679251411b760086db","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1194592,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"André-Luc Dupont","original_name":"André-Luc Dupont","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605b5ffca6c104003dc6ab3c","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38521,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Guy Dufaux","original_name":"Guy Dufaux","popularity":0.0935,"profile_path":"/17n6oMyeNoFdtkitjjByScupc86.jpg","credit_id":"605b5fec70b444005455a70b","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575535,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Serge Beauchemin","original_name":"Serge Beauchemin","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605b5f93d5ffcb00764c007d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1594953,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guy L.
