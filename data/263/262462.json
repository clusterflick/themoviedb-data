We've been here before, but without the hindsight: a camera cruise along a hustler's meat-rack, kitchen-talk over cold canned spaghetti, Taylor Mead grimacing in a spastic dance, the silent stud a sullenly passive observer. Mitchell's ear for campy native wit and eye for figures in a loft-scape happily keep at bay the otherwise contagious NY ennui.","popularity":0.7891,"poster_path":"/9vljw6Ok3CrK2jwrh1a8W1Eb3Fh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12,"logo_path":"/2ycs64eqV5rqKYHyQK0GVoKGvfX.png","name":"New Line Cinema","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The end of a superstar.","title":"Underground U.S.A.","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patti Astor","original_name":"Patti Astor","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/Ava3mV28ZghQI93UEyg6omIABtb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Vickie","credit_id":"5519298d925141731c002d2a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1447661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rene Ricard","original_name":"Rene Ricard","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":"/czXEnsjc2zVPMgR4D4Q3tqIzjkL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kenneth","credit_id":"551929a1c3a36862f6006f9a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Wright","original_name":"Tom Wright","popularity":0.6986,"profile_path":"/lJ4L5fdXBeNr528gBB4eMTdvfd4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Frank","credit_id":"551929cfc3a3682aa8000ec9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1163062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Mitchell","original_name":"Eric Mitchell","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":"/fhRZwRTI2lwl1x7qlFzG5IZyPkU.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Victor","credit_id":"551929e2c3a36862f6006fab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":234296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Curtis","original_name":"Jackie Curtis","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/fgBQvktgF6sNq9MHyV2jnATbC56.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Room-mate","credit_id":"551929f692514115000046e6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cookie Mueller","original_name":"Cookie Mueller","popularity":0.1293,"profile_path":"/5FWYccAKeEGFBKOoQtBvukS8vii.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"The Barmaid","credit_id":"55192a15c3a36862ef007686","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Mead","original_name":"Taylor Mead","popularity":0.3096,"profile_path":"/5UHc1T7cTParS6sfYKD3WBht2rW.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"The Uncle","credit_id":"55192a24c3a3681f84002dfb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lurie","original_name":"John Lurie","popularity":0.3216,"profile_path":"/ocxaaEEcdtKgQTIkkN55L7K1YGh.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Jack Smith","credit_id":"58279b00c3a368361401e789","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1163062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Mitchell","original_name":"Eric Mitchell","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":"/fhRZwRTI2lwl1x7qlFzG5IZyPkU.jpg","credit_id":"5339f780c3a3680e69006b84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom DiCillo","original_name":"Tom DiCillo","popularity":0.1464,"profile_path":"/z8XD6BdliptWiaGP49yYNR2OTTR.jpg","credit_id":"5d4a707f3e01ea0014cbb061","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1163062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Mitchell","original_name":"Eric Mitchell","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":"/fhRZwRTI2lwl1x7qlFzG5IZyPkU.jpg","credit_id":"5d4a702a3e01ea0011cbae11","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1163062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Mitchell","original_name":"Eric Mitchell","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":"/fhRZwRTI2lwl1x7qlFzG5IZyPkU.jpg","credit_id":"5d4a70231b72940018a9b923","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1319313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Steding","original_name":"Walter Steding","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4a72933e01ea0014cbb481","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0081682","wikidata_id":"Q17027504","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9vljw6Ok3CrK2jwrh1a8W1Eb3Fh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
