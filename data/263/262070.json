Inspired by the diary of Gianikian’s father, People, Years, Life uses rare footage depicting the region’s major historic events: the end of Tsarist Russia, violence in the Caucasus during World War I, the 1918 Armenian exodus from Azerbaijan. Gianikian and Ricci Lucchi’s treatment of the material manipulates the speed of the images, adds color and music, and magnifies various parts of the image, so that the movement of bodies across the frame begins to carry the weight of exile, mourning, dispossession.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/zrGkgkXCiJfklQxqWEjedJxB970.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"People, Years, Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1175632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yervant Gianikian","original_name":"Yervant Gianikian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5337c02dc3a3680e96002b19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1175632,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yervant Gianikian","original_name":"Yervant Gianikian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5337c034c3a3680e69002c52","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1175633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angela Ricci Lucchi","original_name":"Angela Ricci Lucchi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5337c041c3a3680e69002c56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1175633,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angela Ricci Lucchi","original_name":"Angela Ricci Lucchi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5337c04ac3a3680e76002c28","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0183951","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A7i9YDzKJbVwghs1F3DrPx6R1gd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zrGkgkXCiJfklQxqWEjedJxB970.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
