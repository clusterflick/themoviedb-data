The victim is the only inhabitant of the home who was not on stage, but a reporter of a gossip magazine. The two investigating police inspectors soon find out that the deceased lady blackmailed most of the inhabitants with little secrets she found out in her time as a reporter - nasty, but harmless things like a little shoplifting, alcoholism, a corrected date of birth, a success one never had... but are these little old secrets reason enough to kill someone? Or is there someone with a more important dark spot in the past?
