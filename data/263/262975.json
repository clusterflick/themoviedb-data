The only moment in his drab life that's out of the ordinary each year seems to be opening the birthday card and gift from his mother. Usually it's a tie, but one year it's an accordion. It goes into the closet with his many ties. A year or two later, he discovers what happens to the papers he processes every day. His discovery sends him first to the building's top floor, then to his closet.","popularity":0.129,"poster_path":"/x9MRBnLZQ0rnTxCKMZstYBguiZx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Necktie","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Necktie","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Nudo en la corbata","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1072277,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean-François Lévesque","original_name":"Jean-François Lévesque","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609a9f10d6590b003d216330","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3086946,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Valérie Dupras","original_name":"Valérie Dupras","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609a9f3925a5360040f7124f","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379361,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Natacha Dufaux","original_name":"Natacha Dufaux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609a9f4593db92003b18b7b6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189606,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marie-Claude Gagné","original_name":"Marie-Claude Gagné","popularity":0.1352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609a9f5125a536003ff6dd98","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3086947,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hugo Fleury","original_name":"Hugo Fleury","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609a9f5b0f1e58003c3778f4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3085067,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Diane Régimbald","original_name":"Diane Régimbald","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609a9f6ef2cf25003bb36420","department":"Production","job":"Administration"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3086948,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"René Chénier","original_name":"René Chénier","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609a9f7a72a2c9003c352738","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588802,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michèle Bélanger","original_name":"Michèle Bélanger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609a9f85efd3c2003c9802df","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1072277,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean-François Lévesque","original_name":"Jean-François Lévesque","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"533ecabdc3a3687067000002","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1072277,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jean-François Lévesque","original_name":"Jean-François Lévesque","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"533ecac3c3a3687067000005","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luc Chamberland","original_name":"Luc Chamberland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676fbc2f62ba310fc012edc9","department":"Visual Effects","job":"2D Artist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1285285","wikidata_id":"Q61068538","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sEsQKVPn7Ivx3X4vvnToKvvdsm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x9MRBnLZQ0rnTxCKMZstYBguiZx.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
