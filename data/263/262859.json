Russian film collective Gogol’s Wives follow each step of the feminist punk band’s battle against Putin including their first disruptive performances on a trolley bus, shooting a video about transparent elections, a controversial performance in a Red Square cathedral, and footage shot in a jail cell. Support comes from many corners including Madonna who painted the words \"Pussy Riot\" on her back and wore a balaclava during her Moscow show. The documentary portrays the grim state of present-day Russia, a country starkly divided between conservatism and anarchy. Pussy Riot believes that art has to be free and they're willing to take it to extremes. \"Pussycat made a mess in the house,\" they say, and the house is Russia. The filmmakers do not seek to moralize, they simply edit events and leave viewers to draw their own conclusions.","popularity":0.6138,"poster_path":"/vLWn0RHzOQy94bPfwSWD9zYlICb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21453,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gogol's Wives","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2013-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Shocking and visceral profile of Pussy Riot and their protests.","title":"Pussy Versus Putin","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Putin versus Pussy","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1172317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariya Alyokhina","original_name":"Mariya Alyokhina","popularity":0.0767,"profile_path":"/tfMYnetrPdE6BS3j8jHqpSbL4MA.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Mariya Alyokhina","credit_id":"533dc9180e0a26449c0000c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1172319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadezhda Tolokonnikova","original_name":"Nadezhda Tolokonnikova","popularity":0.1506,"profile_path":"/pLJb87JawrWYJfm2D34VvZYuKv2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nadezhda Tolokonnikova","credit_id":"533dc9280e0a2644960000dc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1172318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yekaterina Samutsevich","original_name":"Yekaterina Samutsevich","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/vn2yQjpwYSTY0z1Qb3IcCVvdcuB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b9fc9070e0a26637202a125","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3251084,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taisiya Krugovykh","original_name":"Taisiya Krugovykh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6445c277fba6250976705ca3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2541400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vasily Bogatov","original_name":"Vasily Bogatov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6445c2541941860555eb8a02","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2751334","wikidata_id":"Q20149835","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vLWn0RHzOQy94bPfwSWD9zYlICb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10583,"name":"performance art"},{"id":165259,"name":"political unrest"},{"id":173919,"name":"punk band"},{"id":196034,"name":"vladimir putin"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
