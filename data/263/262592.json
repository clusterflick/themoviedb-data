This 90-minute documentary traces the ebb and flow of British festival culture over the past 50 years and explores the central tension between people's desire to come together, dance to the music and build temporary communities; and the desire of the state, councils and locals to police these often unruly gatherings. At the heart of the documentary is an ongoing argument about British freedoms set to a wonderful soundtrack of 50 years of great popular music.","popularity":0.0687,"poster_path":"/sJnJmCp6zYih0ZslhKqpi4oCMld.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Festivals Britannia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2254787,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Williams","original_name":"John Williams","popularity":0.0943,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6193d121223a8b0087a786e5","department":"Production","job":"Producer's Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2254787,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Williams","original_name":"John Williams","popularity":0.0943,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6193d144223a8b00298a1d2c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365592,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sam Bridger","original_name":"Sam Bridger","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55a8385b9251411e06002421","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2190265","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sJnJmCp6zYih0ZslhKqpi4oCMld.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
