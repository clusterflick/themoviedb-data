She suffers from a lingering illness. He helps her find her peace. Left alone, he escapes reality and starts to wander. DRIFT explores his quest for salvation on a mythical journey through a barren Romanian wasteland. Fighting his memories, the drifting man chooses not to speak and to loose himself in an animal-like and primitive existence. His simple but painful rituals echo an ancient culture long forgotten. As the past reveals itself, insanity sets in. Slowly, he disappears as well.","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2014-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drift","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1306811,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Benny Vandendriessche","original_name":"Benny Vandendriessche","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"533dd1c40e0a26449c00011e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1306811,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Benny Vandendriessche","original_name":"Benny Vandendriessche","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"533dd1d90e0a26449c000122","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3153668","wikidata_id":"Q18170005","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
