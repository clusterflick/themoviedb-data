At once \"a comic baroque play, a bourgeois drama, a chansonnier's number, a social satire, a farce and a very pretty love story\" according to Marcel Bluwal, it can also be summed up, according to Beaumarchais, as \"the most bantering of intrigues\".","popularity":0.7033,"poster_path":"/Ak3mlUaGs3muiS9YaLUYXraQ1DN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1293,"logo_path":"/4r2EdENtYK1Ddxmciod3XvmfA9k.png","name":"Office de Radiodiffusion
