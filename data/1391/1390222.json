How a false narrative has managed to keep the whole foundation of our being in its grip by shifting reality into myths.  A story of how oppression and fear have kept us from developing our primal forces for thousands of years, which are now being reclaimed worldwide. Because it's just in our human DNA and it's easier to reclaim than once thought.  A mind-boggling experimental quest by documentarian Marijn Poels into our distant past to win back our primal code again","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zeAhtGZtntFftqAWdnIBJqOnAVF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Primordial Code","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29477790","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2828,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zeAhtGZtntFftqAWdnIBJqOnAVF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
