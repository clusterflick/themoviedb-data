Through the intersecting journeys of this extended and extensive family, the filmmaker explores themes of home, belonging and identity in a life defined by the fragmentary nature of a migratory Caribbean culture. This experimental documentary combines a lyrical first person voice with a family archive of home made audio visual artifacts, interviews and events. As the documentary explores the fragmentary nature of Caribbean identity, it simultaneously celebrates the fragments of domestic memorializing found in home movies, videos and photographs. Stone Street uses these various forms to evoke the experience of a complex and diverse Caribbean and Caribbean diaspora identity.","popularity":0.482,"poster_path":"/iHuWKmZJeOBhJTGlLwkvBvfpbZM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stone Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2954512,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elspeth Kydd","original_name":"Elspeth Kydd","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673e01d88e357a2ded959865","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":853,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iHuWKmZJeOBhJTGlLwkvBvfpbZM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":570},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":853,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jIYvBhynP6mAbFreiMmefgN4til.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":602}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1526,"name":"home"},{"id":3371,"name":"family history"},{"id":202647,"name":"humanity"},{"id":208176,"name":"immigrant experience"},{"id":225219,"name":"reflective"},{"id":227069,"name":"family portrait"},{"id":227083,"name":"trinidad and tobago"},{"id":239660,"name":"home movies"},{"id":242209,"name":"reverie of memory"},{"id":269808,"name":"introspective"},{"id":276564,"name":"black identity"},{"id":308401,"name":"collective memory"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"No official release date - first published online in 2012.","release_date":"2012-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
