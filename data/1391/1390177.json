Sakura and Tamaki, looking forward to Koichi’s return, spend time together as a family, but they end up arguing as they discuss their future plans. In contrast, Koichi wants to respect his daughter’s wishes. Tamaki tries to one-sidedly express her own feelings and finally kicks Koichi out of the house. Just at the awkward mother-daughter relationship, Sakura receives a call that Tamaki has collapsed at work! Sakura anonymously posts her feelings that she can’t tell anyone on social media and seeks solace in a stray cat she meets by chance.","popularity":0.28,"poster_path":"/10RIacfY2Lae9RiFDrPrdaT8GKS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2024-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cat, Me and Another Cat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1146836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yo Hitoto","original_name":"一青窈","popularity":0.1316,"profile_path":"/6ll5Pc2XqC56iZ8pUBuqB8JfVWw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"673c927178f0cd4891739f19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2456656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riru Yoshina","original_name":"吉名莉瑠","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":"/rEnF8rL5TZY5fdAohxtiNwfoKs1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"673c929360b7b3bc94a0c0ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kanji Tsuda","original_name":"津田寛治","popularity":0.6705,"profile_path":"/eG4eAvW6rN7aoF098WDnEWVl0DY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"673c92af2485b85b3ca8db73","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4594423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daisuke Iwai","original_name":"祝大輔","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673f3f9346541bbcd379ea46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1520350,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tomoaki Akune","original_name":"Tomoaki Akune","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b75e087434200c28221e40","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"eiga_neko333"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2a2BJPwN9ZoykAko89H2WFRhM2L.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":2184,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/10RIacfY2Lae9RiFDrPrdaT8GKS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1536},{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":910,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6efPMtcRJbqN0dAlqtW90UjnaNt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
