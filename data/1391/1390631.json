Dopamine, inner peace, or simply being unreachable are all understandable reasons why someone seeks the summit.  With personal stories and individual connections to the mountains, \"Sariri\" brings together five protagonists from Switzerland, Austria, Bolivia, and Peru. Descending steep walls on skis in the Andes at over 6,000 meters pushes the group to their limits. With a first descent of the 6074-meter high \"Chachacomani\" in Bolivia, the mountaineers consciously take certain risks. The invisible power of altitude presents a significant obstacle to overcome.  The film explores the question of why mountains play such an important role in some lives and why these cloud-catchers made of stone, snow, and ice are the closest place to heaven. The willingness to undertake long journeys and the mountain itself are what shapes \"Sariri.\"","popularity":0.3949,"poster_path":"/dxzje69T6wVhok3LzI6OEws1gDP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":245254,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mountain Tribe","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"BO","name":"Bolivia"},{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2024-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Seeking beyond peaks","title":"Sariri","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5070603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andri Bieger","original_name":"Andri Bieger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Andri Bieger","credit_id":"673dd30a890efff9f669753b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5070607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javier Christian Huaman Diaz","original_name":"Javier Christian Huaman Diaz","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Javier Christian Huaman Diaz","credit_id":"673dd31eb23054898da38e37","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5070609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Kogler","original_name":"Martin Kogler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Martin Kogler","credit_id":"673dd32a4ee72b272fef69f3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5070611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Condori Vallejo","original_name":"Sergio Condori Vallejo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Sergio Condori Vallejo","credit_id":"673dd336890efff9f6697559","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5070599,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vali Werner-Tutschku","original_name":"Vali Werner-Tutschku","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Vali Werner-Tutschku","credit_id":"673dd3438e357a2ded958eb6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4052801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Schweller","original_name":"Paul Schweller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673dd2ad890efff9f6697509","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5070599,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vali Werner-Tutschku","original_name":"Vali Werner-Tutschku","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673dd2ca8e357a2ded958e6c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4052801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Schweller","original_name":"Paul Schweller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673dd6f2757b2842d9d8ae6e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/45F6BytrD1t09WNcJisakN91xWw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1919},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y2aK0qOcACiunInPKvkglLqvZuR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1919},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/om4jw6Jc7yDneuP8DMBsbGYx3tP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dxzje69T6wVhok3LzI6OEws1gDP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":193125,"name":"outdoor"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":248915,"name":"skiing"},{"id":330339,"name":"mountains"},{"id":342632,"name":"skitour"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Sariri | Official Trailer","key":"we71_lh4Y5I","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-09-23T11:10:33.000Z","id":"673dd35d8e357a2ded958ebc"}]}}}
