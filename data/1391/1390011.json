The strong man, Max, is her guardian and lends her to an interested artist, James Blackthorne, who promises to educate her for three years, then return her to Max. Nita is in love with one of the performers, Pierre. After three years Max calls for her at the convent, but Nita is afraid of him and runs away. Blackthorne asks his fiancé to give her a home, but Nita overhears a conversation about herself and fears she is not wanted. When Pierre calls to take her back to the circus, she goes. Blackthorne misses her and starts out on a search. Max treats them both brutally, and is so jealous of Pierre that he lets him fall during an acrobatic feat. Pierre is injured, but recovers with Nita at his side. Blackthorne finds her and offers her a home again, but she says she will never leave Pierre.  —Moving Picture World, November 25, 1922","popularity":0.3507,"poster_path":"/gMu6jlON9z7gJWzyyAkPsdhcdU1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shirley of the Circus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1361345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shirley Mason","original_name":"Shirley Mason","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/mtz8dvcq9n2f72hsgZWDCLyExpZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Nita","credit_id":"673bfd45867524e92836e362","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George O'Hara","original_name":"George O'Hara","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/dKvf6F0e946pbtO3pL1YuE1YOvN.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Pierre","credit_id":"673bfd5160b7b3bc94a0afe8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crauford Kent","original_name":"Crauford Kent","popularity":0.1471,"profile_path":"/zYq9Z283YTCX5FYaG59nVs598TD.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"James Blackthorne","credit_id":"673bfd603b480481cdddc503","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Hale","original_name":"Alan Hale","popularity":0.4132,"profile_path":"/e90MwAMkxjDqr3wOnOhDAjvylW5.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Max","credit_id":"673bfd6e3555417913b13bba","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1449341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lule Warrenton","original_name":"Lule Warrenton","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/cKT15bHW6ysYEHryH2gqrhRWbRW.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Blanquette","credit_id":"673bfd7e3555417913b13bd2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1365705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maude Wayne","original_name":"Maude Wayne","popularity":0.0498,"profile_path":"/wNOI4BlKO2WFJQDX2UjQgx1FIXQ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Susan Van Der Pyle","credit_id":"673bfd8c60b7b3bc94a0b002","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathilde Brundage","original_name":"Mathilde Brundage","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/8abMY5gVWjuJosGpdsMrdgWW3kS.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mrs. Van Der Pyle","credit_id":"673bfd9b2485b85b3ca8c3c2","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rowland V.
