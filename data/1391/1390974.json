DESYNCHRONIZED focuses on Pope Canyon Queens, a beekeeping and queen breeding company in Northern California. Pope Canyon Queens is currently trying to rebuild after the 2020 LNU Lightning Complex fires destroyed their farm, shop, and half of their hives. Their crucial work to breed honey bee queens with stronger genes fortifies beekeepers' hives across the country while they face the effects of climate change and unregulated industries. Dr. Nicholas Teets, PhD Entomology, explains how shifts in phenology are predicted to cause bigger issues. Howard Goldstein, Senior Forest Ecologist at the Prospect Park Alliance explores how community gardens and green spaces in large metropolitan areas may help insect populations recover from loss of habitat and food scarcity.","popularity":0.5303,"poster_path":"/vex1MOXMdaTQlfGPmVHjoAcGqQs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":245141,"logo_path":null,"name":"Epiphyte Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desynchronized","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2774345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivia Leyva","original_name":"Olivia Leyva","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673eb3864dec1f98b29bdc4e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5067890,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George K.
