Dickason and presented by William Pizor; these consisted of short films featuring foreign countries and exotic places. This film focuses on life and customs of Egyptians living in Kerdasa, Egypt which is less than a mile away from the Sahara Desert and close to the Pyramids of Giza. It was filmed in 1934, when Egypt was occupied by the British, and thus the film reflects colonialist views and stereotypes present at that time.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children of the Nile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1471912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deane H.
