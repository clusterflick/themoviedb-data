As if perhaps representing distance the scenery begins to expand with great force. Thunderous sounds are heard and electrical poles, broadcast towers and houses fly past. The girl tries to make a phone call because her eyes hurt but on the other end of the line she is connected to Mr. Sakurai at the ferris wheel ticket booth. The mostly backlit shots create a world that seems to be made of silhouettes and is filled with fantastic images and illusions.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/AeYlczA7gLpOvEFfjt9iSAM6Rxh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2010-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mr. Sakurai at the Ticket Counter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Chiketto Uriba no Sakurai-san","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"티켓 발매대의 사쿠라이씨","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Mr. Sakurai at a Ticket Counter","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5070309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Donghoon","original_name":"Kim Donghoon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673d81377b7c4a4955335761","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AeYlczA7gLpOvEFfjt9iSAM6Rxh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"60th Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"2010-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"34th Hong Kong International Film Festival","release_date":"2010-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"39th International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2010-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
