Piacere (Pleasure) tries to cheer her up, promising her eternal beauty if she remains only faithful to pleasure. Bellezza promises never to leave her, or else to accept severe punishment. Piacere warns of the destructive power of useless worry, but now Tempo (Time) and Disinganno (Disillusion) get involved in the conversation. Together they seek to explain the ephemeral nature of beauty, which quickly wilts like a blossom.","popularity":0.0615,"poster_path":"/2pZxmgfDPdzB4NYr5nsDy4zR8XL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":175,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Opera,
