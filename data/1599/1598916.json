Unheard, he perceives the house gradually changing, as if everyone were still in the same place, but separated. When his parents finally announce their separation, there is no confrontation—only an emptiness that remains, now inevitable. \"Empty Place\" portrays this silent rupture, showing how the end can arrive without noise, yet occupy everything around it.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sJ3ZUteOm71g5jy6WXCZr4zC59s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2025-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Empty Place","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5879672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chico Perpetuo","original_name":"Chico Perpetuo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Pai","credit_id":"69408ee4ad6272a9160ef0b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5879673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariana Silveira","original_name":"Mariana Silveira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mãe","credit_id":"69408ef7fb69ed48c2fdae15","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5879676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guilherme Zomer","original_name":"Guilherme Zomer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Filho mais novo","credit_id":"69408f0a977d805407fdadfd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5879677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theo Roese","original_name":"Theo Roese","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Filho mais velho","credit_id":"69408f1fa19ba2616a0ef091","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5879678,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dâniel Nicolas","original_name":"Dâniel Nicolas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69408f33ccd2d3a051816b2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5879681,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ariéli Teixeira","original_name":"Ariéli Teixeira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69408f82ccd2d3a051816b36","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5879673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariana Silveira","original_name":"Mariana Silveira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69408fa8f820565d87fdae34","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5879684,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Luisa Piccoli","original_name":"Luisa Piccoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69408fbf8763bf146b0ef0b5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1600,"iso_3166_1":"BR","iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/sJ3ZUteOm71g5jy6WXCZr4zC59s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1131}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
