Cushing falls seriously ill and, believing he is about to die, asks Benny to deliver a package to his daughter Ruby, who left home to pursue an acting career. Benny soon learns that the package contains $50,000, but resolves to earn the old man's trust, despite his poverty. After arriving in the city, Benny rescues Beatrice Burnett from an attacker, and the two become friends. Later, Beatrice takes Benny to visit her ailing friend, who identifies herself as Cushing's long-lost daughter. Benny gives the money to Ruby and accompanies her back to the farm, where they receive a warm greeting from Cushing, who has recovered from his illness. The army finally accepts Benny, and Ruby promises to marry him when he returns from active duty.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Honest Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1256044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Desmond","original_name":"William Desmond","popularity":0.1134,"profile_path":"/4ZrHPcaKiybXcApPdG7bF29xvwO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Benny Boggs","credit_id":"693f244e46a22c88c699f0b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1351510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Warren","original_name":"Mary Warren","popularity":0.1666,"profile_path":"/zsujqK0DLQ48y3T1L96Ett76gQ2.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Beatrice Burnett","credit_id":"693f245ee5dfdbb8685e035b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1388114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Forrest","original_name":"Ann Forrest","popularity":0.1886,"profile_path":"/oEVwPLi98orL1mbDUR6w1fHFv6R.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ruby Cushing","credit_id":"693f247eae003ff1ac78115b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1795627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Pettie","original_name":"Graham Pettie","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Old Man Cushing","credit_id":"693f2493673d0a74f0781170","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Borzage","original_name":"Frank Borzage","popularity":0.3756,"profile_path":"/ban01OL4OFBDHsWkq4lEPWEtzbi.jpg","credit_id":"693f23eed8b040e0ca781375","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148789,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Henry Payson Dowst","original_name":"Henry Payson Dowst","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f23fcc4a60033f4aecf1e","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689726,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"George Elwood Jenks","original_name":"George Elwood Jenks","popularity":0.1027,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f240e4ece02eee083eb53","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1857888,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pliny Horne","original_name":"Pliny Horne","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f24233362531e79226f67","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93905,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allan Dwan","original_name":"Allan Dwan","popularity":0.4153,"profile_path":"/kAvLKEkjOpOzQSEpvFrjF0b5Nq9.jpg","credit_id":"693f24357567f14c0199ee97","department":"Production","job":"Supervising Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0009194","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1918-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
