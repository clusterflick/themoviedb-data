The film features academics, activists and practitioners, and contains case studies of institutions that are deploying critical, self-reflective forms of curatorial practice. The Museum of London Docklands exhibition on slavery and the sugar industry is examined as an example of how an institution can decolonise the curatorial process, utilise the work of artists in a museum context, and critically examine East London's imperial history. The Pitt Rivers museum in Oxford, who are working with Maasai activists from Kenya and Tanzania on a project centred on repatriating the museum's collection of sacred Maasai artefacts, also features in the film.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/sKdKVJaenRvXT4iUjTjd9Iiw5jG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Decolonising the Curatorial Process","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5877425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Nova","original_name":"Orson Nova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f158722a089d676999622","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5877425,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Orson Nova","original_name":"Orson Nova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f15b48ac8cc0aea226d46","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36725204","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1027,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sKdKVJaenRvXT4iUjTjd9Iiw5jG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":770}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3664,"name":"research"},{"id":2598,"name":"museum"},{"id":162710,"name":"culture"},{"id":192940,"name":"geography"},{"id":204233,"name":"ethnographical"},{"id":277177,"name":"decolonization"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":282633,"name":"history"},{"id":345353,"name":"social sciences"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
