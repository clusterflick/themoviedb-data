Born and bred of the west, he is broad-mined and easy going. In direct contrast to him is Frances, a girl of the east, who comes to the west with Gilman's daughter. Frances has been born and brought up in wealth and culture and does not understand the cowboy who refuses to cater to her whim but who tries to dominate her. Later, when he proposes to her, she accepts him. She leaves for the east, promising to marry him when her course at school is finished. Jack sets about to build a cabin for their home. While at her home in the east, Frances is constantly being urged by Raymond Welton, a club man, to forget the rough cowboy, and to marry him.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52058,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jack","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Borzage","original_name":"Frank Borzage","popularity":0.3756,"profile_path":"/ban01OL4OFBDHsWkq4lEPWEtzbi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jack","credit_id":"693f1385dc5ccab27b781011","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1223502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Little","original_name":"Ann Little","popularity":0.1793,"profile_path":"/mrqXVaieOerBohYDdEPwZYJkl98.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Frances","credit_id":"693f139aae003ff1ac78110f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1273780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick La Reno","original_name":"Dick La Reno","popularity":0.2515,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Gilman","credit_id":"693f13b29a1110571d781159","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite Nichols","original_name":"Marguerite Nichols","popularity":0.0761,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Eva Gilman","credit_id":"693f13d5701ecb0058f789a0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":171030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Richardson","original_name":"Jack Richardson","popularity":0.1236,"profile_path":"/VS5D9sFzk4KTeFjsL1Y15Ck4yb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Raymond Welton","credit_id":"693f13f252d414fffd61ab5d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Borzage","original_name":"Frank Borzage","popularity":0.3756,"profile_path":"/ban01OL4OFBDHsWkq4lEPWEtzbi.jpg","credit_id":"693f1402dc5ccab27b781017","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1400020,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Karl R.
