But many don't know the story of André Dupont, a Savoyard raised in tough conditions, forced into violence in the navy to rise to power and into resourcefulness in civilian life to survive. Antibes, 1952, the transformation: Aguigui Mouna is born. Laughter, solidarity, non-violence, humanism—Mouna has found the meaning of his existence. He will try to share them with all the robots of this \"poop-pee-capitalist\" society. A comic book character who, through his adventures, reveals the absurdities of his century.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wbQ4eLd8qzOcTqBqIRW9ekxkV8X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":283157,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions Bernard Baissat","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1989-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Écoutez Mouna","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1606765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mouna","original_name":"Aguigui Mouna","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/sT1IRL1beKO80nz1YPReeenWrgx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"693e1e1d4a348d31fa5dfe50","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5876286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Baissat","original_name":"Bernard Baissat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wN0qOCSmd0ObXyMv9mttt0hf3gP.jpg","credit_id":"693e1de71aba140c8083e758","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5876286,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Baissat","original_name":"Bernard Baissat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wN0qOCSmd0ObXyMv9mttt0hf3gP.jpg","credit_id":"693e1ded1101b204f499938b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5876438,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marie-Claude Rajon-Coleman","original_name":"Marie-Claude Rajon-Coleman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693e2d27930b1d609d780e07","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4064674","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uC68JWDqhGzMwbC1s0clRkZ1Y4F.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vTNEeALPEf960NrfZMll2Hg62vS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4HKgEynWYHWdikByqlDa0kNYEg6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":853,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wbQ4eLd8qzOcTqBqIRW9ekxkV8X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":569}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2821,"name":"pacifism"},{"id":41388,"name":"portrait"},{"id":210449,"name":"libertarian"},{"id":231729,"name":"humanism"},{"id":257456,"name":"anti-racism"},{"id":297921,"name":"militantism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
