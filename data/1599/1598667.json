Marquise de Merteuil is a master in the art of survival. Alongside the magnetic Vicomte de Valmont, they turn seduction into strategy and weaponise desire. But when their alliance collapses into rivalry, the battle between them threatens to destroy everyone in their path.  Filmed live on stage at the National Theatre, Marianne Elliott (Angels in America) directs this thrilling game of love, lies, and social warfare.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/6pTekPCjhNu9W3obHJGV4d9f0MM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16355,"logo_path":"/tWuPpLrD2urqKPXIit4VLTHWvgK.png","name":"National
