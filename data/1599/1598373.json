After learning that Arnold is married, Tessa rushes out into the rain and runs headlong into Carey Larned, a young millionaire. Carey takes her to his apartment, where a fellow clubman, Olin Humphreys, tries to attack her. In defending her, Carey suffers a lung hemorrhage and is ordered West by his physician to recuperate. In his absence, Tessa is cared for by Madeline Carson, who, although deeply in love with Carey, has inspired only his friendship in return. Under Madeline's watchful eye, Tessa grows into a beautiful and cultured woman. Several years later, Madeline is killed in an accident, and when Carey returns to visit Tessa, he realizes his love for her and proposes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":108194,"logo_path":null,"name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Innocent's Progress","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1307853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Starke","original_name":"Pauline Starke","popularity":0.1505,"profile_path":"/hK0fvkKgcmtiZya4vTf6Bx9z56P.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tessa Fayne","credit_id":"693f223f3dbf84abd483eb89","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian West","original_name":"Lillian West","popularity":0.2584,"profile_path":"/A3ntTVkN6oCH6D173hlAhULMtQZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Madeline Carson","credit_id":"693f22555095af08a8f788b1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1208231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Knowland","original_name":"Alice Knowland","popularity":0.1231,"profile_path":"/c9cttIozUASDkLddBoVyOCm55xT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Aunt Lottie","credit_id":"693f227450f881f97e61a525","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Livingston","original_name":"Jack Livingston","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/3WJWVpo6x4fAHHzQSxrxSXXoAVI.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Carey Larned","credit_id":"693f22856ea2ffb297f78828","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1345843,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Dorian","original_name":"Charles Dorian","popularity":0.1811,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Olin Humphreys","credit_id":"693f22b41b00084c6983ebba","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1795627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Pettie","original_name":"Graham Pettie","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Masters","credit_id":"693f22cf1339bca35a226e31","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Borzage","original_name":"Frank Borzage","popularity":0.3756,"profile_path":"/ban01OL4OFBDHsWkq4lEPWEtzbi.jpg","credit_id":"693f2185d8b040e0ca781364","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1690005,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank S.
