Through him she meets Mrs. Vanessa Yates, a patroness of the arts, and Dr. Emlen Claveloux, who is completely absorbed in science. Connor Lee, a fake spiritualist, persuades her that she has a God-given power to cure ill people, and profits financially by her success in this work. This brings her into conflict with the physician, whom she loves, but her faith in the power of will and her beauty of character finally teach him that faith is at least an important adjunct to medicine.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jRrrtxi9BEKkyfGdWv0yWsbIwHM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82109,"logo_path":null,"name":"Samuel Zierler Photoplay Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hands of Nara","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"愛に生きて","type":"Japanese title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1023476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Kimball Young","original_name":"Clara Kimball Young","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/zMsyHsgLM1XuZyQlYPVeepATc5o.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Nara Alexieff","credit_id":"69409271ea766eb1d70ef087","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5879699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Count John Orloff","original_name":"Count John Orloff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Boris Alexieff","credit_id":"6940928787f63a2b6deecb89","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elliott Dexter","original_name":"Elliott Dexter","popularity":0.2046,"profile_path":"/A4PeHk6k2qeVN4DjI0VmcxdvDW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Emlen Claveloux","credit_id":"69409290ccd2d3a051816b39","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1363171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin Stevens","original_name":"Edwin Stevens","popularity":0.1248,"profile_path":"/4nEaInDqXPLmZB0ofe4VUJc56h1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Connor Lee","credit_id":"6940929bbfa22cfa55bfc925","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vernon Steele","original_name":"Vernon Steele","popularity":0.2077,"profile_path":"/AnlR0BKtAzcQWqSdglDhkUBcHUo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Adam Pine","credit_id":"694092a46b05cd3106816baa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1110702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Miltern","original_name":"John Miltern","popularity":0.2091,"profile_path":"/yoWikg0hgUdxMcSis2JEtMl1rS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dr. Haith Clavelous","credit_id":"694092b0ee717a92b9fdae7f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1304455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Loomis","original_name":"Margaret Loomis","popularity":0.1297,"profile_path":"/zbOKSFO5nobakcoMmDhFhutVMj4.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Emma Gammell","credit_id":"694092bdf820565d87fdae4b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":589729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Mattox","original_name":"Martha Mattox","popularity":0.2593,"profile_path":"/42D4sj76ZMCrWAiPMmU3PWUvCjc.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Miller","credit_id":"694092caea766eb1d70ef08b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2134456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dulcie Cooper","original_name":"Dulcie Cooper","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Carrie Miller","credit_id":"694093250fa3edff8dbfc900","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1186117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Cooper","original_name":"Edward Cooper","popularity":0.1191,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Gus Miller","credit_id":"694093321a350e0da25487bd","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myrtle Stedman","original_name":"Myrtle Stedman","popularity":0.1509,"profile_path":"/stvYIiwLEzDgdd1OBHZT1yUVe16.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Vanessa Yates","credit_id":"6940934bfd2ceb9a9b816b72","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugenie Besserer","original_name":"Eugenie Besserer","popularity":0.2207,"profile_path":"/fcej4GbVD6SSlwbmDotLlv68Nbt.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mrs. Claveloux","credit_id":"69409357d0a17eb5b4bfc94d","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1130762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Garson","original_name":"Harry Garson","popularity":0.2569,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69409390ef0d4d69e48c7a89","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1690005,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank S.
