The \"EP\" is divided into four chapters, with each section representing a different \"track\" of an EP, running less than 15 minutes in total. The tracks can be experienced separately on their own, or watched in succession to explore the connecting threads and overall concept of the EP.  Originally a loose collection of ideas, the images started to engage with one another and laid the foundation for an interesting path to follow. The abrasive sound design by artist D.L.E.I.I. additionally began to mold and shape the visuals (in tandem with the visuals molding and shaping the sound).  Observing light and motion brought to stagnant objects, alternating between natural occurrence and forced application. Bright and dark, active and inert- eventually the object will break.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wog3FQHO2HnIQZsMUqI6kjz4T5q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":189162,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Apothetae Society","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Atrophy to Entropy EP","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958852,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Elizabeth James","original_name":"Elizabeth James","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"69407bff1e29a41bb5eecae1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Eubanks","original_name":"Lee Eubanks","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/2glcdkPrScCrtSK6027OD26UiHe.jpg","credit_id":"69407c10e4d176f11dfdadf2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Eubanks","original_name":"Lee Eubanks","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/2glcdkPrScCrtSK6027OD26UiHe.jpg","credit_id":"69407c1a0da61a0ff6548770","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958845,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"D.L.E.I.I.","original_name":"D.L.E.I.I.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69407c2bed4c6f88f0eeca8a","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wog3FQHO2HnIQZsMUqI6kjz4T5q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Official Selection and Honorable Mention, Portland Film Festival 2024","release_date":"2024-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
