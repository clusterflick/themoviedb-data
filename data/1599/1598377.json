Grant marries Marion Craig, but when she departs for California to visit her sick mother, he becomes enamored of Tonia Marsh, a vamp. Marion discovers them together and leaves Grant, whereupon Taro resolves to help his kind employer out of his difficulties. Persuading Tonia that he is a member of the imperial family of Japan, Taro pays court to the adventuress, and when Grant finds them in each other's arms, he immediately fires Taro. Grant and Marion are reconciled, while Taro sadly returns to Japan.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Is to Blame?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yutaka Abe","original_name":"阿部豊","popularity":0.6837,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Taro San","credit_id":"693f2617d55c0245a25e02c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Livingston","original_name":"Jack Livingston","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/3WJWVpo6x4fAHHzQSxrxSXXoAVI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Grant Barton","credit_id":"693f26246f837005cf99ef2e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1365705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maude Wayne","original_name":"Maude Wayne","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":"/wNOI4BlKO2WFJQDX2UjQgx1FIXQ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marion Craig","credit_id":"693f263803e5caeb735e019c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian West","original_name":"Lillian West","popularity":0.2584,"profile_path":"/A3ntTVkN6oCH6D173hlAhULMtQZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tonia Marsh","credit_id":"693f26463c443514eb61a563","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Langdon","original_name":"Lillian Langdon","popularity":0.1572,"profile_path":"/kOtKzUcdm9SChzXxyj29DfxGMQY.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Craig","credit_id":"693f2655efa9a3fee499f118","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Borzage","original_name":"Frank Borzage","popularity":0.3756,"profile_path":"/ban01OL4OFBDHsWkq4lEPWEtzbi.jpg","credit_id":"693f25972dd462c6aaaecf49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1857888,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pliny Horne","original_name":"Pliny Horne","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f25a34349fb3663f7892f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1489994,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eugenie Magnus Ingleton","original_name":"Eugenie Magnus Ingleton","popularity":0.1388,"profile_path":"/evrnwDDR7uEghNdWJAE14reu8bj.jpg","credit_id":"693f25c8eb8f62e343226efc","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0009799","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1918-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
