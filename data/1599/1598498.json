Namely, chronically unemployed Black men who they refer to as \"the hardcore.\" And predominantly, employing them on the line in auto assembly plants. But in the words of Lloyd Love, a young Detroiter interviewed in the film, this PBS documentary poses the question, \"Do you think a job is the answer?\" The film explores this question in 1968, by speaking with workers, unemployed people, union activists, students, people who implement city-run employment programs, members of DRUM (Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement), and the Detroit Industrial Mission.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7uOKtR5xMd7MlNMI3T63mr1FKyp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do You Think A Job Is the Answer?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5878006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gary Gilson","original_name":"Gary Gilson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Host","credit_id":"693f89332dd462c6aaaed066","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qIUrC8lPU7QKlGNqWzyPb5acYOJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/19GVlHpUpypUIh4smoRT8S7xPOa.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7uOKtR5xMd7MlNMI3T63mr1FKyp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18021,"name":"detroit, michigan"},{"id":33585,"name":"labor"},{"id":164400,"name":"labor union"},{"id":181579,"name":"auto industry"},{"id":278327,"name":"black power"},{"id":353335,"name":"1968"},{"id":359308,"name":"pbs"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1969-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
