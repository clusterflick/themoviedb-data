It is now difficult to remember a time before. When I created this film, it was a time of great confusion, my boyfriend had died two years earlier, and I was not dealing with my precarious position. This film responds to those days of confusion, fear, and acceptance. Hyacinth Fire is a response film to Brose's 1986 film An Individual Desires Solution.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hyacinth Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2021556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lawrence F.
