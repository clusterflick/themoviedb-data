Though they have a helper who visits during the day, Tasuku still has to take care of cooking and housework, as well as helping her mother use the toilet. Because of this, he's had to quit the basketball team. Tasuku hasn't been focusing on his future plans, since he feels like it wouldn't matter in the first place.
