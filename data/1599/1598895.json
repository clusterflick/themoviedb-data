Guanacos, Andean wolves, tuco-tucos condors, crested caracaras, parrots, great crested grebes and herons are presented with their interactions. The ecology was already changed when Tierra del Fuego was settled by Europeans. But when beavers were introduced to create a fur industry, the balance was disturbed even more.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/A5vihBePvhngTgbqDbNp14DtC0M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clash of the Conquerors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/moNcwdhto8jKQiAraDxIhNYaE9Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/A5vihBePvhngTgbqDbNp14DtC0M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
