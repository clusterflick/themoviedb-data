And I believe it will come true one day.\" That's what \"May the Rebel,\" a union activist, anti-militarist, and anarchist, always ready to denounce oppression and defend victims, affirms at 85. Born in Brittany, she earned her living at age 10 delivering butter. In Paris, at 20, she became involved with the Anarchist Union. Sébastien Faure became her mentor. She used a grenade to trigger the Sacco-Vanzetti affair. A union delegate in Moscow in 1922, she sang \"Hymn to Anarchy\" before Trotsky. Children during the Spanish Civil War, Jews during the Second World War, conscientious objectors alongside Louis Lecoin during the Algerian War, and later, through her newspaper Le Réfractaire, the Larzac, Plogoff, and Creys-Malville protests—all these were battlegrounds for May Picqueray. To the very end, she remained true to her commitment to defending peace and individual liberties.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eWEQrLoY6cyUpkv6qxL4VLZ1Od.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":283157,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions Bernard Baissat","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Écoutez May Picqueray","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2821,"name":"pacifism"},{"id":41388,"name":"portrait"},{"id":221038,"name":"syndicalism"},{"id":231729,"name":"humanism"},{"id":262858,"name":"anti-colonialism"},{"id":298891,"name":"women resistance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
