Inside the prison cell, the security officer is openly arguing and expressing himself to the prisoner, who is most likely a detained protester. As the protestor is handcuffed and beaten, the officer defends himself against all arguments that are directed towards the security apparatus. The film puts forth an argument that looks at the human side of the perpetrator, who acknowledges that he might be wrong but at the same time continues to do his job. The officer is seen taking off the scarf that he often wears when he participates in dispersing demonstrations and assaulting protesters, which was commonly worn by officers during the Sudanese revolution to topple Islamist President Om  ar Al-Bashir","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lR0J4xodrzsWxmg7jO6b844OJ1l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":283225,"logo_path":null,"name":"kordofani films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SD","name":"Sudan"}],"release_date":"2019-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kejer's prison","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5877402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"wad elbahar","original_name":"wad elbahar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"693f13864af121c948aeceed","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5877403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"hatim mamon","original_name":"hatim mamon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"693f13a1d02b947ecc83eb3c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1745962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed Kordofani","original_name":"Mohamed Kordofani","popularity":0.1046,"profile_path":"/uINyXqRNpUL0gxq40HftrAGYwuD.jpg","credit_id":"693f127e900da6de7883ea42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2397362,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ibrahim Dessoky","original_name":"Ibrahim Dessoky","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f12ca3e922c371483eb5c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1745962,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed Kordofani","original_name":"Mohamed Kordofani","popularity":0.1046,"profile_path":"/uINyXqRNpUL0gxq40HftrAGYwuD.jpg","credit_id":"693f12eb42c2ceb6782270df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2989546,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Khalid Awad","original_name":"Khalid Awad","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f13305f1e19196883ea10","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1200,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cWh8DjISvrexiclK21sNrMaxjuR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":810},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_3166_1":"SA","iso_639_1":"ar","file_path":"/lR0J4xodrzsWxmg7jO6b844OJ1l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SD","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
