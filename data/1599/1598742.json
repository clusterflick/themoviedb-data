This narrative is rooted in the migration of the artist’s family from Bouira, Algeria - a region known for its textile craftsmanship and pottery, where manual labor was accompanied by collective songs and poetry — to Roubaix, France, the former industrial capital of textiles. This displacement profoundly transformed their relationship to work, to others, and to belonging. It is part of a broader history: that of the rural exodus driven by the promise of urban life, where the pursuit of emancipation often intertwines with experiences of loss and uprooting. A symbolic resonance emerges as well, since Roubaix is an anagram of Bouira, differing by only one letter.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tiɣrist – Threads of Exile","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4045839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samia Dzaïr","original_name":"Samia Dzaïr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69402bfdfdce4618e061a864","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
