His name is well justified, as he has a mania for matching coins. Not far from the ranch lives Ellings, an old placer miner. He has a daughter, Phyllis, whose sole delight in life seems to be in caring for a puny rose bush that she has planted at the side of her father's cabin. By diligent nursing she has managed to bring it to such a stage that it produces a single blossom. As Matchin' Jim is wandering near the cabin one day, hunting, a wild shot from his gun narrowly misses Phyllis and cuts from the rose bush its one lone flower. She calls to Jim, and when he comes to her she points out the damage that he has done. But Jim only grins and tells her that he'll match her to see whether she is going to be mad at him or not.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52058,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Matchin' Jim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Borzage","original_name":"Frank Borzage","popularity":0.3756,"profile_path":"/ban01OL4OFBDHsWkq4lEPWEtzbi.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Matchin' Jim","credit_id":"693f1fa06f837005cf99ef12","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1678978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chick Morrison","original_name":"Chick Morrison","popularity":0.1104,"profile_path":"/iNvwLe8ZA7icLQyj3WxdncpELyi.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Murphy","credit_id":"693f1fbadd2b7cce7a999a06","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1223502,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Little","original_name":"Ann Little","popularity":0.1793,"profile_path":"/mrqXVaieOerBohYDdEPwZYJkl98.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Phyllis Ellings","credit_id":"693f1fc99ac9a1d51361a569","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1273780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick La Reno","original_name":"Dick La Reno","popularity":0.2515,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Old Ellings","credit_id":"693f1fd6e2bbb7e33b99f14a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harvey Clark","original_name":"Harvey Clark","popularity":0.2851,"profile_path":"/mRxpnLg6ybAnFCoEOu3sK6b8hMV.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Hawkins","credit_id":"693f1fea070d5895d1226e44","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5485177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Queenie Rosson","original_name":"Queenie Rosson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Marg","credit_id":"693f20004ece02eee083eb3f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Borzage","original_name":"Frank Borzage","popularity":0.3756,"profile_path":"/ban01OL4OFBDHsWkq4lEPWEtzbi.jpg","credit_id":"693f1f5539298a43de61a521","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Borzage","original_name":"Frank Borzage","popularity":0.3756,"profile_path":"/ban01OL4OFBDHsWkq4lEPWEtzbi.jpg","credit_id":"693f1f6522a089d67699962d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1304454,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"L.
