From church basements to labor struggles, from popular education circles to feminist mobilizations, this film traces the journey of a movement that gave voice to a generation often marginalized by the clerical, political, and business elite.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"See – Judge – Act: The History of the JOC in Quebec","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2349194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annie Deniel","original_name":"Annie Deniel","popularity":0.0537,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f525a673d0a74f078126e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2349194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annie Deniel","original_name":"Annie Deniel","popularity":0.0537,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f527cf1898672da83eaac","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5877744,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"André Vanasse","original_name":"André Vanasse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f52a894464bd09af7898f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5877746,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mario Jean","original_name":"Mario Jean","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f52cc6ea2ffb297f78935","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1740986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Patry","original_name":"Steve Patry","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/nlNoIhZIZDg5FD6PQ0dkrqdT62O.jpg","credit_id":"693f52dfa061899182f789f9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3224060,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Petranko","original_name":"Luis Petranko","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f53003e922c371483ec86","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551516,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Pucella","original_name":"Bruno Pucella","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f53204af121c948aecf90","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5877750,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carl Aksynczak","original_name":"Carl Aksynczak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f533d709b561573aecfb6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551516,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Pucella","original_name":"Bruno Pucella","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f536acc9581fe575e0196","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5877750,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carl Aksynczak","original_name":"Carl Aksynczak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f537e98ee32e1b45e02f5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2349194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annie Deniel","original_name":"Annie Deniel","popularity":0.0537,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f5392e2bbb7e33b99f1e3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5877744,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"André Vanasse","original_name":"André Vanasse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693f53a13dbf84abd483ec05","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2026-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
