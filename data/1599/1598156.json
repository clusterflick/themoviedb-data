The normalisation of misogyny and the pervasive harm to women are central themes, reflecting the anger and frustration born from centuries of oppression. The fury of regressing, particularly during disturbing political regimes, and the profound sense of loss fuel its message. It aims to highlight the urgent need for change and the relentless courage required to speak out against patriarchy and entrenched power structures.  Produced, written and directed by Nikki Teeuw.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A short film by Nikki Teeuw","title":"The Tsunami","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5876847,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Helen Masterman Smith","original_name":"Helen Masterman Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"693e9916e6ff552842f78584","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5927,"name":"violence against women"},{"id":11718,"name":"feminist"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":281523,"name":"gender violence"},{"id":293336,"name":"experimental film"},{"id":298721,"name":"women"},{"id":329577,"name":"arthousefilm"},{"id":357988,"name":"low budget film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Tsunami - A Short Film by Nikki Teeuw","key":"oOpDwNBezWk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2025-07-07T13:55:31.000Z","id":"693e9ad75340d31628999497"}]}}}
