Featuring the voice of Academy Award nominee Naomie Harris (Moonlight) as Mami Wata, part deity and part ancestral memory, the film flows across generations: from a young girl diving into joy, to Great Britain’s first and only Black female Olympic swimmer breaking historic barriers, to a woman learning to swim at 54, defying a legacy of inherited fear.  It is a celebration of connection, resilience and hope, told through the lens of the rising tide of Black women reclaiming their place in the water, and in history.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5oFBTkzaIPQdC13QOUfOnaeY5bL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":283288,"logo_path":null,"name":"Born In Me
