He was imprisoned for a short while in 1973. Disillusioned after the failure of the demonstrations and the death of the only woman he had loved, his life seems to have changed from a period of hope and activism to one of bottomless despair. His friend, Romain Goupil wrote and directed this biographical documentary. Death at 30 received the 1982 Cannes Film Festival's Golden Camera Award for \"Best First Feature-Length Film.\"","popularity":0.1941,"poster_path":"/24cNufb9iRXqNuDy9uEbCHrceow.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1982-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Half a Life","video":false,"vote_average":6.05,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Mourir à 30 Ans","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Mourir à trente ans","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Death at Thirty","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Death at 30","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romain Goupil","original_name":"Romain Goupil","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":"/9JVpIlhTH8HeINK3pwI16XivW7z.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64df6f02aaec7103fbeac2f0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romain Goupil","original_name":"Romain Goupil","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":"/9JVpIlhTH8HeINK3pwI16XivW7z.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bcdc3a36847f821476b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1148304,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Franssou Prenant","original_name":"Franssou Prenant","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0ac251c3a3684b2500c861","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192569,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jean-César Chiabaut","original_name":"Jean-César Chiabaut","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0ac214c3a3684b28005d84","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1435259,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sophie Goupil","original_name":"Sophie Goupil","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0ac2279251411e5400830c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156927,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Renan Pollès","original_name":"Renan Pollès","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b0ac23c0e0a260e150089aa","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Romain Goupil","original_name":"Romain Goupil","popularity":0.072,"profile_path":"/9JVpIlhTH8HeINK3pwI16XivW7z.jpg","credit_id":"5b0ac26d0e0a260df2008b9f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0084361","wikidata_id":"Q3326144","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":899,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e2xM6QK3VWqBKDSPkZlejGxvY3q.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1599},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":899,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fG80ARLX2GD5syZsXQTAvFAgbM6.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1599},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7WHrNMaazu7YTs5569zlbH6YZBs.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/24cNufb9iRXqNuDy9uEbCHrceow.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":236,"name":"suicide"},{"id":2339,"name":"political activism"},{"id":12192,"name":"counter-culture"},{"id":232462,"name":"leftist radicalism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
