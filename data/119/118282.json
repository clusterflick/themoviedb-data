In 1986, the right won the legislative elections and he became Prime Minister. After two years of tough cohabitation, François Mitterrand was re-elected in 1988. After a moment of despondency, the Chirac machine started up again. During the referendum on Maastricht, he took a position for the \"yes\", against the vast majority of his party. In March 1993, the opposition led by Chirac won a crushing victory. Edouard Balladur became Prime Minister. In 1995, Jacques Chirac was elected President of the Republic: thirty years of political life found their fulfillment.","popularity":0.1394,"poster_path":"/wneKHFvti3o5DNcQ4kgt62zlbS6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55216,"logo_path":"/pyDDOSzQdVQU5F69qBOgtCn8q9J.png","name":"Kuiv Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":220,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chirac","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Chirac","original_name":"Jacques Chirac","popularity":0.2219,"profile_path":"/c0ckSdaB4IurFscsfF1VUzLOEvI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4bd2c3a36847f8215343","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1070724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michèle Alliot-Marie","original_name":"Michèle Alliot-Marie","popularity":0.064,"profile_path":"/54lOOlfdzq9UIwpeRuYcziRdL7X.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4bd2c3a36847f821534d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1070725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Allègre","original_name":"Claude Allègre","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4bd2c3a36847f8215351","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1070726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martine Aubry","original_name":"Martine Aubry","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4bd2c3a36847f8215355","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81572,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick Rotman","original_name":"Patrick Rotman","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":"/hT3hhjpaEsbIe2n8iOTNOAASTuZ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bd2c3a36847f8215349","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0872316","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/wneKHFvti3o5DNcQ4kgt62zlbS6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
