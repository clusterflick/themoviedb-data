Mograbi offers a powerful, at times chilling, lament of the continuing cycles of violence rooted in the past and threatening to engulf everyone's future. With the roots of so much real-world conflict left unexamined by today's restless media, this film reminds us just how vital filmmakers like Avi Mograbi are.  Documentary today is rarely immersed in questions of this magnitude - or tackles them with the level of eloquence shown here by Mograbi. An exceptional and challenging film.","popularity":0.0795,"poster_path":"/nhZSQUFVVpamW6eMsfdIyuAKEEs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avenge But One of My Two Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Avi Mograbi","original_name":"Avi Mograbi","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/iQNxH2kKDrcFZJeTHfsd9Nrq6b9.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bddc3a36847f82171af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0459934","wikidata_id":"Q790439","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/lUqABe5pqw8Pfh3xhmNgZK7YYao.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":2061,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cIEEtKNDvZ3YSlN69b4WnoltR65.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1475},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/bdrEwU0Rltuf9F9DMWak6vvcfiZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nhZSQUFVVpamW6eMsfdIyuAKEEs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5hRzsFKrfor7Ja0KOQybsSHEeTD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
