In the staid and stifling environment of a post-World War II army post in France, Callan's deeply repressed attraction to other men surfaces when he encounters handsome Private Swanson. Maintaining the rugged \"man's man\" image of a war hero, Callan barks orders to his underlings. Later, lonely in his solitude, he recalls the frightening experiences of war and the events that led to this crossroads. Filled with self-loathing and unable to act on the natural attraction he feels for Swanson, Callan's affection festers into antagonism. He pushes Swanson constantly with verbal assaults and undeserved punishments.","popularity":0.7181,"poster_path":"/ebaYATxKUFkac6yU5dKdVXPt5Is.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4051,"logo_path":"/cr7fvW3IZ1xQmlHTk0CHqoa038b.png","name":"Warner Bros.-Seven Arts","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Just one weakness....
