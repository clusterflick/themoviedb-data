It is close to functional, but something isn't right. His wife, Mary Anne, is running out of patience. She loathes the woods in which they live and yearns for a return to the city. Problems arise when their already tense situation is exasperated by the appearance of shadow beings, which torment them during the night. Sylvain slowly comes to realize that this is not a localized event and some greater scheme might be at work. From the meth producing hillbillies on the mountain top to the corrupt lawman, Sheriff Donnelly, no one can escape the reach of the shadow people. Sylvain starts to suspect his device has something to do with it, but cannot bring himself to destroy the machine he has worked so hard to create.","popularity":0.4636,"poster_path":"/7M1U6z5nidro9g9zDSV3ELoggnG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadow People","video":false,"vote_average":3.9,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Grizzly Flats","type":"IMDb display title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judd Nelson","original_name":"Judd Nelson","popularity":1.2519,"profile_path":"/7kRf8vE0ZjMuunh8BaD50B3EhS5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sheriff Donnelly","credit_id":"52fe4bd2c3a36847f821541f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":105783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle De Luca","original_name":"Danielle De Luca","popularity":0.2034,"profile_path":"/fjSLIWBPP1dZCKd8oXVGfbMaVfS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Renee","credit_id":"52fe4bd2c3a36847f8215423","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1067271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Maurice Gantt","original_name":"Christian Maurice Gantt","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Pastor Ron","credit_id":"52fe4bd2c3a36847f8215427","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1067272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Karloff","original_name":"Ryan Karloff","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sylvain","credit_id":"52fe4bd2c3a36847f821542b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1574203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maggie VandenBerghe","original_name":"Maggie VandenBerghe","popularity":0.2395,"profile_path":"/oeCWntM1HJyvy15DPeWHIO4NU5l.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mary Anne","credit_id":"56b78cb99251410755002144","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1067270,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joe Benkis","original_name":"Joe Benkis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bd2c3a36847f821541b","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228801,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Fankhauser","original_name":"Anthony Fankhauser","popularity":0.242,"profile_path":"/d88sL3akL6iaOkr47DbXBcpEEkF.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bd2c3a36847f8215415","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228801,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anthony Fankhauser","original_name":"Anthony Fankhauser","popularity":0.242,"profile_path":"/d88sL3akL6iaOkr47DbXBcpEEkF.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bd2c3a36847f821540f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1732160","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1483,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7M1U6z5nidro9g9zDSV3ELoggnG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Grizzly Flats (2011)  Trailer","key":"s4wQ2kOmJ54","published_at":"2012-06-28T20:46:38.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6e7c3a3685448008bc8"}]}}}
