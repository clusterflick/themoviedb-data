Proving this to be the case is difficult, however, as it is generally accepted that as those who are 'profoundly retarded' cannot communicate, therefore they cannot think.  In the case of Annie O'Farrell (Tina Arhondis), finding a way for her to 'talk', other than speaking or writing, finally shows that she is not only able to think, but is highly intelligent. The battle against the hospital to acknowledge this in a legal sense goes to court, as the psychiatrists try to hide their misdiagnosis.","popularity":0.4124,"poster_path":"/2ZCsC1j2M6TwqXFDmh0uR1sRv8a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Annie's Coming Out","video":false,"vote_average":5.792,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"A Test of Love","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Punch McGregor","original_name":"Angela Punch McGregor","popularity":0.3623,"profile_path":"/voNajIPvfuxa6qZhz549Om21A3h.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jessica Hathaway","credit_id":"537bb1c9c3a3684b56000196","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Forsythe","original_name":"Drew Forsythe","popularity":0.1529,"profile_path":"/z8295bQqwwOwA6fI3uf8PWYSlCy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"David","credit_id":"537bb1d3c3a3684b4e00018b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":110493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liddy Clark","original_name":"Liddy Clark","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":"/pvWdqTMUMb2wJtztiRjJ0owpaY6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sally Clements","credit_id":"537bb1dec3a3684b5d00019f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":75956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monica Maughan","original_name":"Monica Maughan","popularity":0.1257,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Vera Peters","credit_id":"537bb1e7c3a3684b54000173","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1233689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippa Baker","original_name":"Philippa Baker","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sister Waterman","credit_id":"537bb1f1c3a3684b56000199","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Arhondis","original_name":"Tina Arhondis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Annie O'Farrell","credit_id":"537bb1fbc3a3684b4b0001a5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1220988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Frawley","original_name":"John Frawley","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Harding","credit_id":"537bb212c3a3684b5a0001ab","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1321905,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gil Brealey","original_name":"Gil Brealey","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/emOPThiVzmTBOHrC7Ew4xXnIWQb.jpg","credit_id":"537bb1b1c3a3684b5a00019e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0088250","wikidata_id":"Q4769203","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2ZCsC1j2M6TwqXFDmh0uR1sRv8a.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pvzDfiZWSJxlVUl2Inl7YaBr8VC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
