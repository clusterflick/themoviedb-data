Young and attractive Mandy (Yo Yo Mung) flees the hustle of Hong Kong proper and a failed relationship for the bucolic quiet of Peng Chau, one of several dozen communities located on the former colony's outlying islands. There she stays in a rooming house with the mute and slightly slow Kam Shui (Louis Koo). In spite of herself, she falls for the misfit, much to the consternation of Angel (Siu Au), Kam Shui's tomboyish best friend who also harbors feelings for him. Chiu masterfully brings out the nuances of life on the island in this simple tale, simply told.","popularity":0.828,"poster_path":"/x9MWE60O1PDnHk412U065d8MljN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5632,"logo_path":null,"name":"Milkyway Image","origin_country":"HK"},{"id":41465,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mei Ah Films Production","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1999-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sealed with a Kiss","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Tim Yin Mat Yue","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Koo","original_name":"古天樂","popularity":1.7191,"profile_path":"/yQuDBTzm7xWlJICNvl20OmcJP80.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kam Sui","credit_id":"52fe4bd8c3a36847f8216521","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoyo Mung Ka-Wai","original_name":"蒙嘉慧","popularity":1.1014,"profile_path":"/1651iRvA6LEYQZDFzEyPafHGN70.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mandy","credit_id":"52fe4bd8c3a36847f8216525","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Ho-Yin Wong","original_name":"黃浩然","popularity":1.0721,"profile_path":"/wrs7gHK5Ykyae2okZbrQU9bgIKN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"59463a3e9251413fc2022622","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sue Au","original_name":"Sue Au","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Angel","credit_id":"59463b22c3a36816e4022c35","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1418535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Four Tse Liu-Shut","original_name":"Four Tse Liu-Shut","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/n1VeK7KLiIpJ5m8tm4XErmIyeSA.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Officer Pang","credit_id":"59463b37c3a36816f60242a9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Chan Kwok-Kwan","original_name":"陳國坤","popularity":1.1972,"profile_path":"/hkHu1Z4EtN47bPwh6PlBIE3Jz76.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Yellow Hair Thug","credit_id":"59463b429251413fbb022ff0","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":949034,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Derek Chiu","original_name":"Derek Chiu","popularity":0.1136,"profile_path":"/ymt1Z4CYOODC6ItxFYENGAPnb9q.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4bd8c3a36847f8216519","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3054460,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Maggie Choy Yin-Ching","original_name":"蔡彥菁","popularity":0.0987,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6343f752a61de1007ddb51da","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johnnie To","original_name":"杜琪峯","popularity":0.9177,"profile_path":"/kc5Bs54FyXdjwZ0igPbW9X9aqS7.jpg","credit_id":"59463b619251413fb602317c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835109,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Hui Hon","original_name":"Hui Hon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59463b57c3a36816e4022c81","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25241,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chan Chi Wai","original_name":"Chan Chi Wai","popularity":0.1264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f18c6e9a6d93100357d1cb1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cub Chin Kong-Hon","original_name":"Cub Chin Kong-Hon","popularity":0.1831,"profile_path":"/pzax1NjtIxZPXhMmlN9cYOksppX.jpg","credit_id":"6785eadbc81acaa63dbc1e96","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0266947","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ead27tRlTEi1ZRGSVK7xLKhHRmh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x9MWE60O1PDnHk412U065d8MljN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
