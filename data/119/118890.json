The wood many Kenyans use to boil this water to make it safe is increasingly valuable. Women and girls, who bear the responsibility for finding water and fuel, often miss school or work while seeking both fuel and water. Some even encounter sexual violence. Yet waterborne illness remains a daily--and life-threatening--reality for them and their families. Carbon For Water introduces audiences to the inspiring people who face these hardships, and explores one company's innovative solution for improving the health of millions of Kenyans and the environment in which they live.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carbon for Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1068830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmen Elsa López","original_name":"Carmen Elsa López","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4beac3a36847f821900b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1068829,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evan Abramson","original_name":"Evan Abramson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4beac3a36847f8219005","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2112921","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"PFF 2012: Carbon for Water (USA, 2011)","key":"0hI983pkgrU","published_at":"2012-01-29T08:14:37.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6e7c3a3685448008c1d"}]}}}
