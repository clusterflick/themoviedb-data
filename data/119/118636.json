Super-scientist Larry Martin, inventor of the first stratospheric-flight spaceship as well as a jet-powered personal flying suit with helmet, is called upon by the government to investigate ramped-up UFO reports occasioned by the Martians' spaceships.  The Martians, meanwhile, led by Marex, engage a renegade earth scientist and a gaggle of gangsters to help them steal supplies, operate a menacing robot, and build their bomb.  This movie serial in 12 chapters was originally planned as a sequel to \"Radar Men From The Moon\" with Commando Cody as the hero but at the last moment the main characters' names were changed and all other references to that serial removed from the script.","popularity":1.5484,"poster_path":"/iGppZUjWuQwa47q3kW8Vv2px1HO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":167,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"YOU'LL SAY...AMAZING!...STARTLING!...UNBELIEVEABLE!...YET HOW FAR IS IT FROM THE TRUTH","title":"Zombies of the Stratosphere","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Des Satans Satellit","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Φαντάσματα της Στρατόσφαιρας","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1234560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judd Holdren","original_name":"Judd Holdren","popularity":0.0734,"profile_path":"/gjpzszVLXNdUZxpCptZdkO4lKF3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Larry Martin","credit_id":"58b75968c3a368454f0004d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aline Towne","original_name":"Aline Towne","popularity":0.1744,"profile_path":"/kxVzIsrEAGX5zUWhGKWwkBOtTx0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sue Davis","credit_id":"58b759729251414ed0000545","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":160930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lane Bradford","original_name":"Lane Bradford","popularity":0.4625,"profile_path":"/mRn7rr4JK2AuLeQrau6vVmjYJcN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marex","credit_id":"58b75980c3a368456f00053f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Waxman","original_name":"Stanley Waxman","popularity":0.1402,"profile_path":"/r3wH00LrdwgHeN2TLZmnBjHqFiR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Harding","credit_id":"58b7598cc3a368457b00053d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilson Wood","original_name":"Wilson Wood","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Bob Wilson","credit_id":"58b759949251414ebf0005a4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Crawford","original_name":"John Crawford","popularity":0.5954,"profile_path":"/82pqVVILPiC6GpjenmepSTjnOMB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Roth","credit_id":"58b759f29251414ebb0005e4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":200573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Boyle","original_name":"Ray Boyle","popularity":0.1846,"profile_path":"/l7jz0l8fBeA81RDzlzJVpr2kQAh.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Shane","credit_id":"58b759fe9251414eee000572","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonard Nimoy","original_name":"Leonard Nimoy","popularity":1.3407,"profile_path":"/eKhw3oK8ak5LDB29X9zQDLIqRhw.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narab","credit_id":"57b31ff0c3a368730800066a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1768173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Kelly","original_name":"Craig Kelly","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mr. Henderson","credit_id":"58b75a16c3a368459300058f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gayle Kellogg","original_name":"Gayle Kellogg","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"58b75a2fc3a368458b0005cc","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Garabedian","original_name":"Robert Garabedian","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Elah","credit_id":"58b75a23c3a3684532000560","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33955,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred C.
