The manner of their deaths, the radicalness of their slogans (they were the first overtly anti-American statements to be heard in public since the conclusion of the Korean War) deeply shocked Korean society at the time. Twenty years have since passed. The world has changed.","popularity":0.2292,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Past is a Strange Country","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Past is a Foreign Country","type":"alternative translation"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1066939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Eung-soo","original_name":"Kim Eung-soo","popularity":0.2132,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Interviewer/Interviewee","credit_id":"57eb3e3cc3a3683941000f99","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1685163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeon Ho-sik","original_name":"Jeon Ho-sik","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Interviewer/Interviewee","credit_id":"57eb3e49c3a36868ba002613","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1066939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Eung-soo","original_name":"Kim Eung-soo","popularity":0.2132,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4bcfc3a36847f8214aab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1685163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeon Ho-sik","original_name":"Jeon Ho-sik","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57eb3840c3a368397e000ddc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1685161,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Park Ki-woong","original_name":"Park Ki-woong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57eb3882c3a3683941000d29","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":4108,"name":"protest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2008-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
