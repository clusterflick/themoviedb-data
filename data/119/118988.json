Sixty years later, six college students armed with cameras and recording equipment venture into the asylum to prove the existence of the paranormal. Thrills turn into nightmares as members of the group go missing without a sound, cell phones mysteriously vanish, corridors turn into mazes, walls appear where doors once stood, flashlights fail and something or someone begins toying with the group. Days later, when five of the six friends turn up missing, the lone survivor must go through the recovered footage in order to clear his name and find out what happened to his friends","popularity":0.5409,"poster_path":"/5HwVKoYP75qF5Q6sft3X1vocMWb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Somethings don't want to be found","title":"Paranormal Incident","video":false,"vote_average":3.9,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Paranormal Investigations 4","type":"DVD Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Barton","original_name":"Amanda Barton","popularity":0.0842,"profile_path":"/ieHrvR0R0yRe8pcqJnh84hzsJK0.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Rebecca","credit_id":"52fe4befc3a36847f8219d77","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Downey","original_name":"Thomas Downey","popularity":0.161,"profile_path":"/u6crnQsLAxZ4o7LlDjcMuxTA8XZ.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Agent Watts","credit_id":"52fe4befc3a36847f8219d7f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1070280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katrina Kemp","original_name":"Katrina Kemp","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Female Mental Patient","credit_id":"52fe4befc3a36847f8219d87","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1070281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Rayon","original_name":"Oliver Rayon","popularity":0.1795,"profile_path":"/wiL9HFzT2zLLTAiPFtSjXDB3rjt.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"John","credit_id":"52fe4befc3a36847f8219d8b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1070285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Seivwright","original_name":"Ashley Seivwright","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"kayden","credit_id":"52fe4befc3a36847f8219d93","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1070286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadia Underwood","original_name":"Nadia Underwood","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Blake","credit_id":"52fe4befc3a36847f8219d97","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derrick Scott","original_name":"Derrick Scott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Daniel","credit_id":"57dd3ea39251410db5003087","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1530555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brett Edwards","original_name":"Brett Edwards","popularity":0.2196,"profile_path":"/6ukrSteMkLkMvwzu5dmPH2LBK82.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Brennan","credit_id":"62c44ce49672ed23d095ae95","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1070263,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matthew Bolton","original_name":"Matthew Bolton","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4befc3a36847f8219d49","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1013324,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matthew Bolton","original_name":"Matthew Bolton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4befc3a36847f8219d4f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1013324,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matthew Bolton","original_name":"Matthew Bolton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4befc3a36847f8219d55","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1070273,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Haley O'Neil","original_name":"Haley O'Neil","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4befc3a36847f8219d73","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1070261,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matthew Bolton","original_name":"Matthew Bolton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4befc3a36847f8219d3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1070262,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chris W.
