The film was inspired by encounters with the filmmaker and told through taped interviews, reconstructions of meetings with Vláčil, visits to actual film locations (of Marketa Lazarova, The Valley of the Bees and Adelheid) and Vláčil-inspired film sequences. The result is one of the most unique and personal portraits of any artist – a collage of voices, sounds and images that evoke and celebrate Vláčil’s life and work.","popularity":0.1752,"poster_path":"/fvhNOBwaO2LO9pXMiYiaZnPqPdV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121283,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filio","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":34256,"logo_path":"/wBec7lBwbscan3pcBdZUS4i5wcf.png","name":"Bionaut","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká
