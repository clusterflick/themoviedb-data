Although it's short, it was billed as a main attraction. This government funded propaganda film features the classic folklore character Momotaro and his animal friends as they attack Pearl Harbor which is defended by characters strikingly similar to Bluto and Olive Oil from the Popeye cartoons. The animation is mixed with real video footage from the attack on Pearl Harbor supplied by the military.","popularity":0.079,"poster_path":"/4eXmjmYBHInHjHaijObMz2Qfwl8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87104,"logo_path":null,"name":"Geijutsu Eiga-sha","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1943-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Momotaro's Sea Eagles","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Momotaro no umiwashi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mitsuyo Seo","original_name":"瀬尾光世","popularity":0.1009,"profile_path":"/ck6WIURJO9QOxjk6DelWLnpuYyq.jpg","credit_id":"593fee00c3a36803c100ef50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1068376,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arishige Kurihara","original_name":"Arishige Kurihara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf7d949c3a3686375085a55","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1530003,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Noboru Itō","original_name":"伊藤昇","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf7d96b9251415ccc0e1332","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mitsuyo Seo","original_name":"瀬尾光世","popularity":0.1009,"profile_path":"/ck6WIURJO9QOxjk6DelWLnpuYyq.jpg","credit_id":"5bf7d97d0e0a264f6e087ed0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0420783","wikidata_id":"Q1967083","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4eXmjmYBHInHjHaijObMz2Qfwl8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1943-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
