Echoing Dziga Vertov’s concepts and Eadweard Muybridge’s techniques (shooting only one or two frames per second), Andersen masterfully brings forward what makes Souto de Moura an original: the incorporation of the passing of time into architectural designs, positing them within a history fraught with class struggle and societal changes, in a continuum with ruins—from which they may originate, and to which they will return—and with nature—which they frame, and by which they are framed.","popularity":0.106,"poster_path":"/SizrmE2RugMfpF6LjUfGWRfVi3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2012-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reconversion","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thom Andersen","original_name":"Thom Andersen","popularity":0.0921,"profile_path":"/AgqAplydKlWWIpQgJd8lZSvV2u3.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b469251416c910d5417","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130244,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Peter Bo Rappmund","original_name":"Peter Bo Rappmund","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55346555c3a36852de002aa6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2878684,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Raquel da Silva","original_name":"Raquel da Silva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc7ad3613a388003c059d55","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2614316","wikidata_id":"Q23806761","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2QwL0BA5ljxKShSa65nQBa2uVjW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/SizrmE2RugMfpF6LjUfGWRfVi3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/x87S7IpcsQcRVdNOKGH0YCUqDwC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul International Architecture Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
