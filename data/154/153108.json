Unbeknownst to them, Lauren, overworked and overstressed, is getting a little extra help from a new prescription medication. The meds come on strong, twisting Lauren's appearance and causing an icy change in her demeanor, but the powerful medication also helps her get all of her duties done in a quick and efficient manner. Everything seems normal until Mr. and Mrs. Allen return home to discover the horrifying result of Lauren's brutal efficiency. Side Effect is a blood-curdling tale of science gone wrong in a pill-popping culture where the cure is more deadly than the disease.","popularity":0.3799,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What if Evil came in a pill?","title":"Side Effect","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":945392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzy Cote","original_name":"Suzy Cote","popularity":0.0792,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Allen","credit_id":"52fe4b399251416c910d3b63","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1097185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mat Lageman","original_name":"Mat Lageman","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Zach","credit_id":"52fe4b399251416c910d3b67","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":157885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Nail","original_name":"Jonathan Nail","popularity":0.1194,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mr. Allen","credit_id":"52fe4b399251416c910d3b6b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":804206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Newcomb","original_name":"Virginia Newcomb","popularity":0.1368,"profile_path":"/xdin5aWu7H3SI46fFeC9lCNpwUO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lauren","credit_id":"52fe4b399251416c910d3b6f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1133678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Zykov","original_name":"Daniel Zykov","popularity":0.0756,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bailey","credit_id":"52fe4b399251416c910d3b73","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":928858,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Liz Adams","original_name":"Liz Adams","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b399251416c910d3b59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":928858,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Liz Adams","original_name":"Liz Adams","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b399251416c910d3b5f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1215917","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
