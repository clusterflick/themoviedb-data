Captured at the pinnacle of their power and popularity, Paul Desmond (alto sax), Joe Morello (drums), Eugene Wright (bass) and Dave Brubeck (piano) explore the trails they blazed into the realm of odd time signatures with \"Forty Days\" and two versions of their groundbreaking hit \"Take Five\", as well as forays into world music with two unique interpretations of \"Koto Song\".
