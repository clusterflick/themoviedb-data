Ghazali became known as the Proof of Islam and his path of love and spiritual excellence overcame the pitfalls of the organised religion of his day. His path was largely abandoned by early 20th century Muslim reformers for the more strident and less tolerant school of Ibn Taymiyya. Combining drama with documentary, this film argues that Ghazali's Islam is the antidote for today's terror.","popularity":0.4542,"poster_path":"/eqFykIbzOMjSLjln5bLFcKDGjfS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":188100,"logo_path":null,"name":"Matmedia Productions Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Al-Ghazali: The Alchemist of Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148663,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon van der Borgh","original_name":"Simon van der Borgh","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6395e0a18a88b2007d93048e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2008752,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abdul Latif Salazar","original_name":"Abdul Latif Salazar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5aba13699251414d2e010dc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0439430","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1aZSNnt1I8FdJaF7aHYmvGaB4xP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eqFykIbzOMjSLjln5bLFcKDGjfS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4fmWkcuCgUjqFuKfbynwjGXSbu0.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":490,"name":"philosophy"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":154705,"name":"islamic"},{"id":161218,"name":"theology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
