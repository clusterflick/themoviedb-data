A totalitarian regime has forbidden time: time watches have been confiscated, photo cameras are illegal as they freeze a point in time. A typical Servais theme: a power is oppressed by a constraint that denies what is best in the individual, and therefore has to be twisted in various ways, to establish an entirely artificial world, that has rules that may question some of the rules of our world at this side of the mirror.","popularity":0.5493,"poster_path":"/gU0eypUcxcoFaqoZwMrFuXVylb0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7005,"logo_path":null,"name":"Iblis
