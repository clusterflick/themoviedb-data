Machinery assists the bulb manufacture. A virtuoso glassblower begins a more complex tube used in radio broadcasting; it is then turned, fired, and sculpted. Conveyors carry partially completed units. Workers perform their various specific assembly-line tasks. Cases are manufactured and machined, wire harnesses are assembled, loudspeakers are produced. As radios near completion, they are run through a series of tests. Engineers and draughtsmen define future developments. In a closing stop-motion sequence, in a style reminiscent of Norman McLaren, a group of loudspeakers performs a playful dance. The film overall is a poetic depiction of an industrial process.","popularity":0.1184,"poster_path":"/4mNVqZeOWV0VcRlqCxXQlows3fL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51322,"logo_path":null,"name":"Capi-Holland","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":251272,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nederlandse Philips, Eindhoven","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1931-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Philips-Radio","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joris Ivens","original_name":"Joris Ivens","popularity":0.2496,"profile_path":"/fNUOfmwxX37zV05kkbK4EFSrAfY.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b3c9251416c910d40eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joris Ivens","original_name":"Joris Ivens","popularity":0.2496,"profile_path":"/fNUOfmwxX37zV05kkbK4EFSrAfY.jpg","credit_id":"57c80e049251410f37002dbb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1062568,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Helen van Dongen","original_name":"Helen van Dongen","popularity":0.0907,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c80e11c3a36845fe003044","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1672941,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lou Lichtveld","original_name":"Lou Lichtveld","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c80e31c3a36845f4003152","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1672942,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lou Lichtveld","original_name":"Lou Lichtveld","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c80e349251410f22002e17","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1089217,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Fernhout","original_name":"John Fernhout","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/eGhcV5sQKwqPkcO6mxnt4JJ1wNy.jpg","credit_id":"6793db2dc5081346f148414a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0164134","wikidata_id":"Q96573412","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":757,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4mNVqZeOWV0VcRlqCxXQlows3fL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":516}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1931-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
