The film examines evidence that ancient civilizations may have known of this celestial cycle and that our Sun may indeed display the characteristics of binary motion.  Just as the Earth’s spin on its axis causes day and night and our planet’s annual orbit around the Sun is responsible for the ongoing cycle of the seasons, what if there is some greater celestial cycle, lasting thousands of years, slowly influencing the rise and fall of civilization across the globe? Where is the evidence? What could be the cause?","popularity":2.4829,"poster_path":"/6e13bM1kpvqAzBI7hRh3y4T2BDt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How much did the ancients really know?","title":"The Great Year","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Earl Jones","original_name":"James Earl Jones","popularity":4.0266,"profile_path":"/oqMPIsXrl9SZkRfIKN08eFROmH6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4b389251416c910d39cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Cruttenden","original_name":"Walter Cruttenden","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b389251416c910d39d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1028353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Anthony West","original_name":"John Anthony West","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/8U2CnfWKG5VaJceL3OS4gJBhsZ4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b389251416c910d39d5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uwe Homann","original_name":"Uwe Homann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b389251416c910d39d9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Däppen","original_name":"Werner Däppen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b389251416c910d39dd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brother Achalananda","original_name":"Brother Achalananda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4b389251416c910d39e1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronald J.
