To prove it he's looking for a greenhorn that can be turned into a candidate. A call is put out for would-be participants, and hundreds apply. A small group is selected and under go training. Polish master Marcel Lozinksi followed Tymochowicz and this project for three years, and this beautifully shot and edited work paints a compelling portrait of cynical (and quite familiar) demagogy and populism in action.","popularity":0.0711,"poster_path":"/iXjGIVS6eWoXBDPEBoLxWyvp4I5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42841,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Filmowe Kalejdoskop","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":6480,"logo_path":"/qJUUNzFYXNUDaisssBTV3Zdki9R.png","name":"TVP","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2006-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How It's Done","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1590186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piotr Tymochowicz","original_name":"Piotr Tymochowicz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"56e4ea1dc3a3685aa80054a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1590187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacek Hugo-Bader","original_name":"Jacek Hugo-Bader","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"56e4ea2892514165250014ba","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":46260,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zbigniew Domagalski","original_name":"Zbigniew Domagalski","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56e4ea01c3a3685a90005e07","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Łoziński","original_name":"Marcel Łoziński","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56e4e9b6c3a3685a9e00592c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1590185,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Agnieszka Bak","original_name":"Agnieszka Bak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56e4e9f19251416d4600557d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1378,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacek Petrycki","original_name":"Jacek Petrycki","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bff9f370e0a262cfb05360d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2179079,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrzej Adamczak","original_name":"Andrzej Adamczak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bff9f48c3a368647606a4a8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":566112,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Radek Ładczuk","original_name":"Radek Ładczuk","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/Id9yoModmqkGK2ZIAwOj0vymMA.jpg","credit_id":"5bff9f63c3a368647606a4d1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1408555,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Katarzyna Maciejko-Kowalczyk","original_name":"Katarzyna Maciejko-Kowalczyk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bffa0619251410b92055ece","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198887,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Łoziński","original_name":"Marcel Łoziński","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bff9f200e0a262cfb0535f6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2185225,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lesław Skuza","original_name":"Lesław Skuza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bffa051925141165405b663","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0926302","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/iXjGIVS6eWoXBDPEBoLxWyvp4I5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
