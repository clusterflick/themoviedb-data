Sawdust cascades from above, catching shafts of light. In this room, an apparition fades into existence: the ghostly figure of El’s mother, beckoning her into the light.  Through visions of El’s past – memories that seep in from dreams, coalescing into a violent storm of anger and heartache – Pulp asks whether it’s possible to ask for forgiveness, and whether El can at last overcome the grief that she carries with her.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pulp","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
