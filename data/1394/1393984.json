Tens of thousands were killed and many more were left homeless. Through the voices of common people, Homecoming tells a story about the raise of a small, invisible Balkan country with enormous natural and human beauty from the ashes of terror; the country which still bears the scars, both physical and psychological, of the conflict during the War of Independence. It reflects upon a part of history that, although can never be changed, has molded and influenced a generation in a positive way.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/s9oYaXMlaayhgvbxqzsgC01iSnQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":245808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yellow","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homecoming","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3200862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andi Reiss","original_name":"Andi Reiss","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67461cce474aa26f872d2f6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1454746,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tina Galović","original_name":"Tina Galović","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67461cdf9c5df08c3f124cb1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316962,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ivan Pavličić","original_name":"Ivan Pavličić","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67461cec9c5df08c3f124cb5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3200862,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andi Reiss","original_name":"Andi Reiss","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67461cf8474aa26f872d2f76","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2325645","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s9oYaXMlaayhgvbxqzsgC01iSnQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
