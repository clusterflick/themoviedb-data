It’s the story of a country forging its identity through music and an ethos of bands that toured longer, drove further and played harder to be heard. When bands would play live seven nights a week, sometimes playing three gigs in one day – sometimes even playing three gigs, in three different states, in the one day!","popularity":0.1329,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2025-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Sweat It Out!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Hartley","original_name":"Mark Hartley","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":"/xMNNzUQji2LJbQMIFJm6MLXVkIG.jpg","credit_id":"67451348cc1d69986bd9f351","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2523504,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cathy Rodda","original_name":"Cathy Rodda","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674513599f40a7aaf6ea72fb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18001,"name":"rock band"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
