There are many voices, many layers. From the inside of caves on a rainy night to the words of the Pajé. From the cave paintings of Serra da Capivara to the dirt roads of Minas Gerais. The power of so many voices went beyond photography and the photographer and documentarian became a painter, to continue giving voice and investigating layers and layers of Deep Brazil.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imersões Noturnas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5081939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustavo Mazzola","original_name":"Gustavo Mazzola","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6744db71cfd24c3a7aaba198","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2024-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
