Slovenly Mr Sinclair is shown how to get his garage fit for purpose by Ford publicity guru Mr Harding. Soon the untidy pile of out of date brochures are replaced by a bespoke Ford display cabinet, prospects are safely organised in a card index system and there are\"fine photographs of Dagenham\" on the walls. This is a fascinating insight into branding and sales, 1930s style.","popularity":0.0894,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":245636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sound-Services","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1937-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Dealers Only","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Butcher","original_name":"Ernest Butcher","popularity":0.138,"profile_path":"/i5cgHklQglRsZ57zFKNAGgZnXMc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6743ee3ec24765fa2f2dd5b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Longden","original_name":"John Longden","popularity":0.2634,"profile_path":"/g6flKUPBYtUDZjzDcsz86pD9nH4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6743ee489f40a7aaf6ea4ee3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Street","original_name":"George Street","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6743ee55c24765fa2f2dd5d2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Francis","original_name":"Dick Francis","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6743ee659f40a7aaf6ea4ef1","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115372,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ralph Smart","original_name":"Ralph Smart","popularity":0.1952,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6743ee119f40a7aaf6ea4ebf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31151646","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1937-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
