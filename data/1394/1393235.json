The mapping took place under the auspices of the department of geography from Kansas University in Lawrence, Kansas in collaboration with the Foreign Military Studies Office (FMSO) at Fort Leavenworth, in Leavenworth, Kansas. The FMSO senior analyst Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey B. Demarest declares in several essays and texts that communal ownership of property, leads to crime and insurgency. The film irrefutably exposes an ongoing military strategy to criminalize indigenous land tenure and identity in order to secure political and economic interests in the region.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":245691,"logo_path":null,"name":"Manovuelta Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Demarest Factor: The Ethics of U.S. Department of Defense Funding for Academic Research in Mexico","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5081361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Sedillo","original_name":"Simon Sedillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67449549df1f2ec7bc0bb4ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"El Factor Demarest / The Demarest Factor (Bilingue English/Español)","key":"GIb3cJJdVYQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2013-08-23T02:11:13.000Z","id":"674494e446260e14fbeb4104"}]}}}
