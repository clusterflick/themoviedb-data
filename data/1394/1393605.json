While Juvenile maintains a thriving career, the other two faced tragic outcomes: Soulja Slim was murdered in 2003 just as his career was taking off, and B.G. was sentenced to 14 years in federal prison in 2012. Their sons-Young Juve, T.Y., and Lil' Soulja Slim-met as teenagers and, inspired by their shared legacies, formed the group Ghetto Children, named after a Juvenile song. This documentary is an intimate portrait of Black boyhood transforming into manhood, shaped by their fathers' legacies. The film explores how these young men strive to carve out their own identities in the music world, navigating the weight of generational expectations, the families they build, and the culture that surrounds them.","popularity":0.0551,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghetto Children","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bloodthicker","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1773381,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Zac Manuel","original_name":"Zac Manuel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67452871100e4f4524fbd68b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1758981,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Justin Zweifach","original_name":"Justin Zweifach","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674528a308052b960c04025d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1122391,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robin Schwartz","original_name":"Robin Schwartz","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"674528b29f40a7aaf6ea76c4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1773381,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Zac Manuel","original_name":"Zac Manuel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"675dfb275d7034db5a490d08","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34261278","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New Orleans Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
