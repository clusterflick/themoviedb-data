Male and female troops and groups march past; Hitler grins. A band of young men in uniform march along in a slow and low goosestep; Mussolini makes some kind of signal with his hands that commentator jokes means \"If he doesn't do it right, chop his head off\". Tanks move along past the Colosseum. Hitler and Mussolini go through a rather comical \"After you Claude - No, after you Cecil\" bit of business. It look like each is modestly acknowledging the roar of the crowds, while intimating that the glory belongs to the other.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":244642,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathe Gazette","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1938-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Italians Goose Step for Hitler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30207704","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1938-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
