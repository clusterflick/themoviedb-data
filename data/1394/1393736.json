When Virginia is sixteen, her mother receives a letter from a wealthy aunt in Paris, who offers to make Virginia her heir and give her a good education, providing Virginia will, in the future, make her aunt's home her own. Virginia goes leaving Paul brokenhearted at her departure. Virginia tries to be a dutiful niece, but when her aunt insists that Virginia marry a rich nobleman she refuses, and her aunt disowns her sending her back to her island home. Virginia's ship arrives during a hurricane, and despite being only a cable's length from shore, it sinks before help can reach it. Paul almost loses his own life in a vain attempt to save her, but Virginia is lost.","popularity":0.1072,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":176030,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thanhouser Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1910-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paul and Virginia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Hall Crane","original_name":"Frank Hall Crane","popularity":0.0818,"profile_path":"/2zd8LQQjBcb01YyJm3EqdxTm4SU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"67459647d4014c2db770c363","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1070708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Violet Heming","original_name":"Violet Heming","popularity":0.1146,"profile_path":"/f2rHacf64rzyV6QRemr1JHupa58.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Virginia","credit_id":"674596529f40a7aaf6ea8489","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2630302,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre","original_name":"Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6745966fcfd24c3a7aabb37d","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5083008,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernardine Saint-Pierre","original_name":"Bernardine Saint-Pierre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6745969808052b960c040e29","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0409139","wikidata_id":"Q19866130","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1910-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
