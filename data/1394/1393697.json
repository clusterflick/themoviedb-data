Also known as Lemberg and home to an old, well-established Jewish community, this city nestled in a valley projects an aura of prosperity. Parks and pavilions punctuate its public spaces as trucks, pushcarts and bicycles ply its busy streets. Among the Jewish community landmarks shown are the Yad Haruzim Trade Union Building, the Old Ghetto, the softly curving exterior of the Modern Temple, the orthodox school, the Moorish-looking Lazarus Hospital and the grave of the \"Golden Rose\"-filmed in warm, dappled light-and the Nowosci Theater.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":245769,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinor","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1939-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lwów","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Jewish Life in Lwow","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asher Lerner","original_name":"Asher Lerner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"67457e0093f2cdebcc2e2624","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457779,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saul Goskind","original_name":"Saul Goskind","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67457de16eef5b43a5fc9917","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1457780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yitzhak Goskind","original_name":"Yitzhak Goskind","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67457de9100e4f4524fbdbe0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1062927","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"yi","note":"","release_date":"1939-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
