Questioning their racial exclusivity, she takes an unprecedented insider's look at the pageantry and asks: what does it mean to be the queen of the masked men? As she examines her own place in an alluring tradition, Snedeker challenges viewers to reflect on the roles we all play in our lives. Ideal for courses in gender studies, sociology, anthropology, american studies, multicultural studies, southern history and psychology.","popularity":0.1046,"poster_path":"/mCe3F460wVME8NCf5trKkJKLuqP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"By Invitation Only","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2810069,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julie Gustafson","original_name":"Julie Gustafson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61449bc7daf57c004362ae3d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148123,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Isaac Webb","original_name":"Isaac Webb","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61449bd35e1200004233c1d8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2769283,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Snedeker","original_name":"Rebecca Snedeker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61471eecdaf57c002c92c6cf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3239696,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Courtney Egan","original_name":"Courtney Egan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6147201a22df2e00656ad71c","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2769283,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Snedeker","original_name":"Rebecca Snedeker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61471edd511d09002b5e92d4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3239697,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"David Sullivan","original_name":"David Sullivan","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6147204b511d09008a1ba5d0","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3239692,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Melissa Thompson","original_name":"Melissa Thompson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61471f9b9450fe002cbb6797","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2806069,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tim Watson","original_name":"Tim Watson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61471f029f0e19004378a3d3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2806069,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tim Watson","original_name":"Tim Watson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61471f115e12000020b75358","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3239694,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Francis James","original_name":"Francis James","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61471ff2511d09002b5e93ac","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1335127,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Larry Blake","original_name":"Larry Blake","popularity":0.1988,"profile_path":"/pIKbbRZ6tAYk0Eg2QOkotbwp7rp.jpg","credit_id":"6415276e5690b5010161a505","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2769283,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Snedeker","original_name":"Rebecca Snedeker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f56a03f9d89390037d19241","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1568805","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1444,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mCe3F460wVME8NCf5trKkJKLuqP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":963}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
