The community, their ancient burial grounds, environment, and ways of life are forever disrupted, and access to opportunities and essential services are severed. Enforced residential schooling and a tainted water supply compound the devastating impact. Community leader and former combat engineer Daryl Redsky sheds light on how generations of complex planning, cultural preservation and mobilization have led us to the current moment—and to the construction of Freedom Road.","popularity":0.0692,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freedom Road: Context","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2769197,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Angelina McLeod","original_name":"Angelina McLeod","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f568c0890cf510033a5a3f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2769203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daryl Redsky","original_name":"Daryl Redsky","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f568c129661fc00370f9da6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1701259,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anita Lubosch","original_name":"Anita Lubosch","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f568dbd90cf510032a611fe","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Christensen","original_name":"David Christensen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/l1CPoYVXwTNxXSMbpxze2ZaykuH.jpg","credit_id":"5f568ce5350398003283524c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2769199,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paula Kelly","original_name":"Paula Kelly","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f568bd990dde00036ecc4e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1842968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erika MacPherson","original_name":"Erika MacPherson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f568d0a84f2490035fed735","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2769210,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tyler Funk","original_name":"Tyler Funk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f568d6884f2490038fc5c37","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2769197,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Angelina McLeod","original_name":"Angelina McLeod","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f568ba3fd4a960037271aac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779559,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alicia Smith","original_name":"Alicia Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f568cd69d89390036d17ae6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2762343,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tyler Funk","original_name":"Tyler Funk","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lOzMPFX8PURRnn6rTBN61AO4ywK.jpg","credit_id":"5f568dae1d78f200349a5a66","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2769199,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paula Kelly","original_name":"Paula Kelly","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f568bcb9661fc00370f9ca1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2769197,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Angelina McLeod","original_name":"Angelina McLeod","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f568bb3031a1d0038fb2226","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"rough estimate from comments section on video, only year listed on webpage","release_date":"2019-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
