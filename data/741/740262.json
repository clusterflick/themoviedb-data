This is the story of a tour the band makes to visit Aboriginal communites in central Australia, stopping at Alice Springs, Hermannsburg, Papunya and Yuendumu. It's a fascinating insight into their thoughts and feelings as they bring their version of \"white man's culture\" to outback communities where traditional Indigenous culture and language is strong.","popularity":0.0934,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Country Outcasts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1579348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Roberts","original_name":"David Roberts","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f54f9eb5c564e003619b4f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1977-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
