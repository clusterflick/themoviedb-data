Imagine what would happen if a spectator were to enter inside that dark device? This is exactly what is staged in this video. Unexpected things happen, a \"miraculous\" meeting between Ana and Ahmad. The girl from 'Where is the spirit?' She is a spectator who is not only in front of the Kiarostami film, but materially within it, she is an intruder who bursts into the action. and somehow the death of a traditional type of spectator is enunciated, one who seeks empathy with the protagonists. It seems that empathy with fictional characters is no longer possible, this new viewer is situated in a different place, demands new projection spaces and, of course, other types of forms. \" - Celeste Araújo.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9SfOybOEkJ7t3I19ynmSOIu980s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"¿Dónde está el espíritu?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1580019,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oriol Sánchez","original_name":"Oriol Sánchez","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/sNcXoba4DxeVG1QzXSde7dbYGG.jpg","credit_id":"5f56638be627190036ebc97f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9SfOybOEkJ7t3I19ynmSOIu980s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
