From the excessive use of its resources to the consequences of climate change and pollution, all is revealed in different shades of blue. Haiti’s fate will be linked to the coasts and the children of Haiti – voodoo priestesses, fishermen, merchants, entrepreneurs, urban planners, historians, biologists and climate experts – help to tell the tale. A candid depiction of the challenges and the opportunities that must be seized before it’s too late.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HT","name":"Haiti"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Haitian; Haitian Creole","iso_639_1":"ht","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thus Spoke the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HT","title":"Ainsi parla la Mer","type":"Français"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2131324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnold Antonin","original_name":"Arnold Antonin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6439aea27ef381052262733f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2131324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnold Antonin","original_name":"Arnold Antonin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6439aea8955c6505a9026f1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
