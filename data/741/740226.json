From the fall of the Qing Dynasty to the founding of the Republic, from the Sino-Japanese War to the founding of the People’s Republic. With a patriotic spirit, he joined the revolution and used the theatre to promote the revolutionary course. For a ‘stronger China’, and ‘education for all’, he chose film as his life long goal and career. Lai was more than the father of Hong Kong cinema was; he was also one of the pioneers of the Chinese cinema. He made Hong Kong’s first short fiction film ‘Zhuangzi Tests His Wife’. He opened the first Chinese owned cinema, the New World Cinema, in Hong Kong…. In the several decades, Lai had devoted his life and fortune in writing this glorious inaugural chapter in early Chinese film history. The technical enhancement, the introduction of foreign techniques and equipment were all part of his contribution to the Chinese cinema.","popularity":0.2955,"poster_path":"/7XxgMGQsrQre1GPbDPbbrxRibYl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98112,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dragon Ray Motion Pictures Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lai Man-wai: Father of Hong Kong Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clifford Choi","original_name":"Clifford Choi","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":"/34Wx34CkMnA6MQedxtNYhLEawW4.jpg","credit_id":"6616da19eb79c20164a9dac0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2767848,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Louis Lee Shu-Man","original_name":"Louis Lee Shu-Man","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f54c4fc8390180038b62e9c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367308,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Law Kar","original_name":"Law Kar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gU8EwIVpK3OIYVKuPIk4WZUiJMk.jpg","credit_id":"5f54c3d55c564e00341a1039","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2767846,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lai Sek","original_name":"Lai Sek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f54c4905c564e00361966cb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2767845,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephanie Ng Yuet-Wah","original_name":"Stephanie Ng Yuet-Wah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f54c4341511aa003417d521","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roy Chow Hin-Yeung","original_name":"Roy Chow Hin-Yeung","popularity":0.1518,"profile_path":"/oyOpQJAvrfN0GNK7OuhcF85uW6b.jpg","credit_id":"5f54c4db5c564e003519a9cc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1367308,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Law Kar","original_name":"Law Kar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gU8EwIVpK3OIYVKuPIk4WZUiJMk.jpg","credit_id":"5f54c9921511aa003417deed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1392196,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Law Wing-Fai","original_name":"羅永暉","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":"/sHpbT5VvrawecoZCQpHvf9XFXmE.jpg","credit_id":"67d7d0715addf20955f1605c","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.755,"height":2643,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7XxgMGQsrQre1GPbDPbbrxRibYl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1995}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12354,"name":"hong kong"},{"id":193023,"name":"chinese cinema"},{"id":337395,"name":"new world cinema"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Cantonese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Cantonese\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"cn\", \"native_name\"=>\"Cantonese\"}","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
