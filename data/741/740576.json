It tells the story of Agnes Evans, an average woman who loses her parents and little sister Tilly in a car accident. Having been very distant from her sister while she was alive, Agnes embarks in an adventure to get to know her sister better by playing a Dungeons & Dragons module that Tilly had written, and discovers things she'd never imagined. The plot takes place in reality and in the imaginary game world; in the game world Agnes learns about Tilly's exploration with her sexuality and how she struggled with her sexuality in reality. The play is also presented in a \"Young Adventurer's Edition\" which removes the explicit language and ages down the characters.","popularity":0.0546,"poster_path":"/yPdz3uVSrnLOHor8bRjTgv0i2oN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"She Kills Monsters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1273,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yPdz3uVSrnLOHor8bRjTgv0i2oN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
