The lord and lady of the house eagerly try to bring the baron into the family as their son-in-law, but neither the baron nor their daughter, Eva, seem particularly interested. Eva is a bit of a wildcat who spends her days roaming the countryside and play fighting with her male friends, while the baron yearns for the urban sophistication of the city life from which he came. When an old friend, the celebrated actress Aspesia, invites him to attend some nearby film shoots, he doesn’t hesitate for a second. However, the letter from Aspesia ends up in the hands of two wandering knife grinders, Pat and Patachon, who soon find a way to use the letter’s contents to their own advantage.
