Nathan is by definition a solo, but it's also a pas de deux between dancer and camera. A young man in casual business attire enters a nondescript hotel room. Immediately he begins a series of improvisatory dance phrases, partnering with chairs, lamps, bed. Repeated attempts at graceful, balletic poses often end in crashes to the floor, broken chairs, and twisted bed sheets.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ltNqCWqJhf9gEJyNhpxPn9JUasp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nathan (Hotel Room CT)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3552239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Herring","original_name":"Oliver Herring","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6580b87dd5191f08f5ad8686","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ltNqCWqJhf9gEJyNhpxPn9JUasp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
