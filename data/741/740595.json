In the 1990s Todd retired Utopia and reverted to making his own music, with varying degrees of success, and then last year came the announcement of the long-awaited U.S. reunion tour, where the album in review here originates. Recorded in Chicago on 22nd May 2018, the music reflects a run through many of the finer moments of the Utopia back catalogue. Todd is joined by fellow original members Willie Wilcox (drums) and Kasim Sultan (bass), alongside replacement keyboard player Gil Assayas who covered at short notice for an indisposed Ralph Shuckett. The original 70's-formed band established a stellar reputation for stretching the prog rock/pop.
