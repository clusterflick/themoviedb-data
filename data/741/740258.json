We did this by going to a setting that we felt took us away from this, allowing us to create a sense of freedom in the mind and body. This feeling initiated a continuation of ideas and choices we then made. Our approach was experimental and instinctive. The spontaneity of both the performer and filmmaker drives what is visually experienced and additionally, the element of sound coexists as an important impulse to the dance. As Leanne progresses, she translates the present moment into unrelenting motion and an expression of empowerment.","popularity":0.0193,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Your Turn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2767966,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dimitri Defossé","original_name":"Dimitri Defossé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f54f6885c564e00351a0c34","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2767965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolee Tsin","original_name":"Nicolee Tsin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f54f67af5f1c5003987f293","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
