The wearing of the yellow star is decreed. On the verge of bankruptcy, Joseph Haffmann, a Jewish jeweler, offers his employee, Pierre Vigneau, to entrust him with his shop if he agrees to hide it until the situation improves for the Jewish community in France. Will Peter take the risk to clandestinely host his \"old\" boss? And if so, under what condition? Pierre finally accepted. Named six times for Molières, four times awarded, this play by Jean-Philippe Daguerre has been adapted for the cinema with, in the main roles, Daniel Auteuil, Sara Giraudeau and Gilles Lellouche. The film will be released in 2021.","popularity":0.1366,"poster_path":"/rg9R351YXm9P447q9QiWzst0FzC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":121513,"logo_path":"/2k2sAvoWs8gGA7KiVdLr0AqKDUw.png","name":"ADLTV","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":135748,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atelier Théâtre Actuel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adieu Monsieur Haffmann","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grégori Baquet","original_name":"Grégori Baquet","popularity":0.2065,"profile_path":"/vZEOVTspzPD51h74qb0e6411s3W.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f551410594c940036e39e83","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2768092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandre Bonstein","original_name":"Alexandre Bonstein","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/ghoLrMDZC6471NxlDpfyoYdC6s8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f55141a84f2490037f940de","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1955044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Cavanna","original_name":"Julie Cavanna","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/uVk3PEUNBt0ChW2J8gmFocsf90W.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f55142184f2490038f9065e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franck Desmedt","original_name":"Franck Desmedt","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f551428594c940037e46cc6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2768093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Matzneff","original_name":"Charlotte Matzneff","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/7KY4zhEHyMQAqo96DngrnhLnLyG.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f551430594c940035e4db2d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Philippe Daguerre","original_name":"Jean-Philippe Daguerre","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f551388594c940037e46b00","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":552975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"François Hanss","original_name":"François Hanss","popularity":0.0737,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f55138f594c940037e46b06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Philippe Daguerre","original_name":"Jean-Philippe Daguerre","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f551399594c940037e46b24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ofai7oviZZl8MmKovLQb2LY0RSz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rg9R351YXm9P447q9QiWzst0FzC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":90,"name":"paris, france"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":4326,"name":"theater play"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bande Annonce Adieu Monsieur Haffmann","key":"hG9O_WezNlE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-02-10T01:23:53.000Z","id":"5f551496713ed40036ef2aca"}]}}}
