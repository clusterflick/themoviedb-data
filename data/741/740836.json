The movie which opens with a soul pleasing shot of the river Brahmaputra with a ship ferrying, takes us to the river island and introduces us to the unvarying and routine life of Moukon, Luit, Simanta, Joi, Topon, and Bhaskar. Moukon, a young carefree girl finds herself at the center of some mysterious deaths after which she is socially considered a jinx. Simanta, Joi and his friends are well qualified but are still in search of a substantial life. Life is also indifferent for Luit who moves from door to door by selling insurance policies and has no better resolutions for the future.
