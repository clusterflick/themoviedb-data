These memories, narrated in first person by the documentary filmmaker, range from the emergence of the M-19 guerrilla group in 1970 to the votes in the plebiscite for peace, the result of negotiations between the Colombian government and the FARC guerrilla group in 2016. The atypical family is made up of a conservative father who was the mayor of Medellín and a mother who is an academic, intellectual, and researcher of violence, threatened with death and exiled as a result of her ideas and research. The typical place, is a social and sports club of the elite of Medellín about to turn 100 years, and from where the political destinies of the whole country are still decided.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yTnvwjw6SNVM1X1az1bjSJACNMx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Las razones del lobo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2766986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Hincapié Uribe","original_name":"Marta Hincapié Uribe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f53ed59b234b9003721a8ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yTnvwjw6SNVM1X1az1bjSJACNMx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FIDBA","release_date":"2020-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
