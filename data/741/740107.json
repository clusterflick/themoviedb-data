He only wants to get enough money to go back to homeland to rescue his parents from abject poverty, but is forced to make increasing difficult decisions that go against what's left of his conscience. How far is too far when one tries to reach his noble goal? GREED is an epic film tribute to Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, a story of family relationships, intrigues and betrayals set against a violent world where nothing is legal, but where everything is possible.","popularity":0.3712,"poster_path":"/8YMV9mpcqoVuEn6Hzwk0fxHOxzU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59625,"logo_path":null,"name":"JCL Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":139711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Q Movies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2020-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Once Youâ€™re in The Family, There is no escape.","title":"Greed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2139070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asif Khan","original_name":"Asif Khan","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jay","credit_id":"5f5441cf12425c0032d20d37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2767316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Jensen","original_name":"Emma Jensen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ruby","credit_id":"5f544219b234b900351cc866","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1280518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorry D'Ercole","original_name":"Lorry D'Ercole","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/rJEGMxSsGu5shZ73p4S6H7PtCtW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Leo","credit_id":"5f55c16ff5f1c500378a8071","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1413066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Queree","original_name":"Robin Queree","popularity":0.0847,"profile_path":"/3nM9XnbTuvxYqByUmOCDeg0kuGX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Enzo","credit_id":"5f55c18ca589020033e5bdb4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1535049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Yerma","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Yerma","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":"/vf5elElGX25CrYkIxEsxLlCoucA.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"John","credit_id":"5f55c1a70443c90035496739","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2768570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Sassen","original_name":"Daniel Sassen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Trevor","credit_id":"5f55c1d7f5f1c500378a813f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2768571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivy Fox","original_name":"Ivy Fox","popularity":0.0591,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Barbara Wilson","credit_id":"5f55c1ef5c564e00341cabf3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3279114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jojo Cyriac George","original_name":"Jojo Cyriac George","popularity":0.0669,"profile_path":"/ts0pdFVTHDkheuklKVDu9Sa6fYH.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"617163f3176a940085359ecc","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2139075,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon-Claire Lee","original_name":"Jon-Claire Lee","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f54429355bc35003234c0c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2768574,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Luxford","original_name":"Robert Luxford","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f55c2765c564e00331da192","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2768575,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christopher O'Young","original_name":"Christopher O'Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f55c2afcb9f4b00386c75dd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2139070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Asif Khan","original_name":"Asif Khan","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f55c237594c940036e49ce9","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1982925,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dion Wilton","original_name":"Dion Wilton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f55c2926a300b0035da27fb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7194894","wikidata_id":"Q127543927","facebook_id":"greedthefilm2019","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":890,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8YMV9mpcqoVuEn6Hzwk0fxHOxzU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":590}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Englisch\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"Englisch\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
