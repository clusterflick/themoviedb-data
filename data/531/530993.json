What exact role did the Sun play in the emergence of life and Mankind? When did Humanity identify it? Then deify it? At what point did Man want to understand it? When and how was the Sun used by Man?\r The Sun is everywhere and is the origin of everything. We are going to show that our culture, our daily lives, our society, our bodies and our lifestyles are all derived from the Sun and are dependent on the Sun.
