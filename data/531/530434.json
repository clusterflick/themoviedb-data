Until 2004, it stood between the small suburban town of Ludwigsfelde and the intersection at Nuthetal. In the times of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), it took one hour to drive – in one of the famous East German “Trabant” cars – from the position of the tree to the East Berlin city center, which is why it was called the One-Hour Oak Tree. When the famous oak so steeped in history was cut down, the idea emerged to turn it into a sculpture.","popularity":0.0486,"poster_path":"/jLAMpJ1VfR46sNsghsvLvqjCHup.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81900,"logo_path":null,"name":"Realistfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hour Oak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerd Kroske","original_name":"Gerd Kroske","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/tCUipJfk6ppEbV5xHwBJVGnaeDP.jpg","credit_id":"5b2516ed0e0a2666fb005e2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerd Kroske","original_name":"Gerd Kroske","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/tCUipJfk6ppEbV5xHwBJVGnaeDP.jpg","credit_id":"5b2516f30e0a266701005d62","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerd Kroske","original_name":"Gerd Kroske","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/tCUipJfk6ppEbV5xHwBJVGnaeDP.jpg","credit_id":"5b2516fbc3a36841fc005040","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":65468,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dieter Chill","original_name":"Dieter Chill","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2517039251410d500053e0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65469,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karin Schöning","original_name":"Karin Schöning","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b25170ac3a36841f9006788","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":774,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jLAMpJ1VfR46sNsghsvLvqjCHup.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
