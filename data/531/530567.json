Featured is a rare interview with  Elvis’ physician and private nurse. You’ll hear from music legend Tony Orlando and his premonition he had about Elvis’ death and about thousands of grief-stricken fans who descended on Graceland, upon the passing of The King.  In \"All The Kings Disciples\" no one could have predicted the passing of Elvis Presley in 1977 and the impact his death would have on the fans who had supported him throughout his storied career. After a period of profound grief, they simply carried on…as if he had never left. From the streets of Memphis, to the gates of GRACELAND and beyond. ALL THE KING’S DISCIPLES will give you a glimpse into the very special world of those who have made Elvis Presley their touchstone, their hero, and their life.","popularity":0.3997,"poster_path":"/kjEYUP6lf59E03iveE2VLcd8NF0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Definitive Elvis 25th Anniversary: Vol. 8 The Day The Music Died & All The Kings Disciples-The Fans","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elvis Presley","original_name":"Elvis Presley","popularity":0.7771,"profile_path":"/psf1wJUw48ALsfV3tN31FX0mDW5.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5b25bc019251410d8100ae58","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kjEYUP6lf59E03iveE2VLcd8NF0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
