Hámos intercuts two parallel narratives to tell his story: a cartoonish, campy science fiction adventure, shot on video; and an elegant, cinematic political thriller, shot on film. Hámos blends the two genres into a tragicomic tale of the role of heroes, their immortality, and the catharsis of a heroic death. The science fiction melodrama features a comic book superhero, Hurry Cane, who saves the earth from the evil Emperor Argon; in the film noir, hired killers have a contract out on the hero Cane. Hámos' analysis of the myth of the hero is articulated in his collusion of the two stylized dramas and their contrasting representational modes..","popularity":0.1638,"poster_path":"/wItSwrA0n9MGaZybtUWX5BKEmsV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1985-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Unbesiegbare","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"L'invincibile","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Udo Kier","original_name":"Udo Kier","popularity":1.106,"profile_path":"/8bD9dTPML8JZgkCzUu2tUN8byOG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Argon","credit_id":"5c4b9ded0e0a260419cf19d4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1150062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt von Ruffin","original_name":"Kurt von Ruffin","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Rath","credit_id":"5c4b9df8c3a36847828e64c1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Peter Hallwachs","original_name":"Hans Peter Hallwachs","popularity":0.1154,"profile_path":"/66e2WDK2JQbVSUTeRrPhKRQRK2N.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Killer","credit_id":"5c4b9e029251415448538380","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1093232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lotti Huber","original_name":"Lotti Huber","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mme.
