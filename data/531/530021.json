They often grew up in orphanages, a fate shared by many of these so-called Amerasians. It is the questions of guilt, origin and homeland of these soldiers and children which the film pursues in a semi-documentary manner. In various conversations, GI and Vietnam veteran John Scott meets with people in Thailand who all have to struggle in their own way with the homelessness resulting from this past.","popularity":0.1017,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":132710,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Harvest Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1985-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amerasia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":213551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Allen","original_name":"Terry Allen","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"65328d86b2681f011ba46e53","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1280190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Surachai Chantimatorn","original_name":"Surachai Chantimatorn","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f19413da6d9310036801814","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":213551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Allen","original_name":"Terry Allen","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65328d9c8d22fc00c9a2e8b4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1486101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wolf-Eckart Bühler","original_name":"Wolf-Eckart Bühler","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b2282c8c3a368149001cac7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1486101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wolf-Eckart Bühler","original_name":"Wolf-Eckart Bühler","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f194033a6d93100378601ff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":72146,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Thomas Balkenhol","original_name":"Thomas Balkenhol","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f194050a6d9310037860302","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237107,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernd Fiedler","original_name":"Bernd Fiedler","popularity":0.1503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f19403c51e6ab0035ca535f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1486101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wolf-Eckart Bühler","original_name":"Wolf-Eckart Bühler","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f194029db952d003594ae23","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0088704","wikidata_id":"Q116754770","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
