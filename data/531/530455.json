One festival is primarily white, the other is predominantly black. While bikers of both colors enjoy both festivals; the city, community and state view these two festivals vastly different creating a divide among the participants, business owners and residents. Against the backdrop of the historical relevance of the area's segregated past, this documentary explores the opposing viewpoints on segregation and integration, mutual love of motorcycle culture, and racial tensions that reach a boiling point every spring in this southern beach mecca.","popularity":0.1443,"poster_path":"/3kNhkqcp74Zi3BeGvre35H9HK4F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Beach White Beach","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Black Beach/White Beach: A tale of two beaches","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Black Beach/White Beach","type":"Amazon Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7774924","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3kNhkqcp74Zi3BeGvre35H9HK4F.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Black Beach/White Beach 2018 (Trailer 2)","key":"xBGmRcU_6vA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-03-13T17:49:38.000Z","id":"634b9f47c8a2d40091875d7c"}]}}}
