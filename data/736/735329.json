In the Romanian uprising in 1989, everything seemed to happen by itself. The people were fed up and were plagued by poverty and terror. There comes a time when action must be taken! But, it turns out that history is not that simple, as this investigative documentary proves. The film is a thorough and revealing reconstruction of the events leading up to Ceaucescu’s downfall and execution. In actual fact, the Romanian revolution was a strictly managed operation, controlled from the outside. Hungary, Germany and especially America had big fingers in the pie.","popularity":0.1757,"poster_path":"/7bYE03Nfd2VgRMOr380zqzd60Ze.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138973,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gunnar Dedio for Looks Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Checkmate: Strategy of a Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41300,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Axel Schneppat","original_name":"Axel Schneppat","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cb5d528dbc330087db0c9d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2750571,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hans-Peter Eckardt","original_name":"Hans-Peter Eckardt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61cb5d5aecaef5008ebbe7f0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2322595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Brandstätter","original_name":"Susanne Brandstätter","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4b4be465e0a200344d4580","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2750566,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roland Possehl","original_name":"Roland Possehl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f40472b028f1400325cae18","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2147247","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1337,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7bYE03Nfd2VgRMOr380zqzd60Ze.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2020,"name":"revolution"},{"id":179882,"name":"romania"},{"id":239902,"name":"political documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
