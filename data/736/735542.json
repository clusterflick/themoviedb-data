The inversions [produced by this] method (the physical action of scanning) [generate] a new language like a disturbed echo from the photographic reviving of moving images. […] The fragments … used [here] are a re-montage of Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow-Up, [while] the original soundtrack of Herbie Hancock has undergone the same process as the images. The movie consists of 10,000 scans put together in a stop-motion film.\" (Benjamin Verhoeven)","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vKc6BmPO99GrRf4LmUYTakvyJA5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2015-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Somebody was Trying to Kill Somebody Else","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2226893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Verhoeven","original_name":"Benjamin Verhoeven","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4131023bd26e003681f295","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vKc6BmPO99GrRf4LmUYTakvyJA5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Expanding Bauhaus.
