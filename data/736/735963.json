The elections of 1924 and 1928 are featured prominently in the story's second half, and along the way a handful of songs from the same time period are played to portray that, while this film is somewhat about the tune 'The Sidewalks of New York', the other songs do their part to lift up and bring the story home, all joining together to complete one of the most inspiring tales in New York history.","popularity":0.2387,"poster_path":"/9fhyYf9rUwJ3kTHwacfUg2awNv5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139068,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jordan Liles Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Sidewalks of New York: The Documentary","title":"The Sidewalks of New York","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2752805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jordan Liles","original_name":"Jordan Liles","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42b37e47721500345e9dce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8eG8wZ0MvE6r0i9J61Q1N7RXe2w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9fhyYf9rUwJ3kTHwacfUg2awNv5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8RMbVIkCstfyqkRppKDup1YdImt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242,"name":"new york city"},{"id":257265,"name":"the roaring twenties"},{"id":270119,"name":"al smith"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
