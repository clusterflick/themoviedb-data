Far more than just a motorbike movie, Dream Racer is a call to arms for anyone who has ever dreamt of doing anything - a spine tingling antidote to the fear of life passing you by unfulfilled.  Dream Racer is the most awarded motorcycle documentary feature film of all time with 10 International Film Awards.
