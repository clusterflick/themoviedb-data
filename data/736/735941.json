Adam Mwarabu advocates for Maasai pastoralists rights to land in international political spheres. Evalyne Leng’arwa pursues a college education in the USA, having convinced her father to return 12 cows to a man contracted to marry her. Frank Kaipai, the village chairman, faces opposition as he promotes secondary school education and tries to save the village forest. Sharing a goal of Maasai self-determination in an ever-changing world, Adam, Evalyne and Frank innovate while maintaining an abiding respect and love for their culture.","popularity":0.2534,"poster_path":"/p53wC2AcWZUMNMW1tGnU9xJEAVU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Porter Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":93532,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gris-Gris Films Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TZ","name":"Tanzania"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Three Parakuyo Maasai individuals are creating solutions to problems facing their community by drawing strength from local traditions","title":"Maasai Remix","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Mulvihill","original_name":"Ron Mulvihill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4299e599d5c30033b83bd4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2752747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelly Askew","original_name":"Kelly Askew","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4299ff477215003362a3a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2519344,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeff Porter","original_name":"Jeff Porter","popularity":0.1636,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f429a3241a5610032cb8569","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2752749,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Peter Breithaupt","original_name":"Peter Breithaupt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f429a85477215003560c18b","department":"Crew","job":"Score Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2752753,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Evalyne Mkulati","original_name":"Evalyne Mkulati","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f429cbd6eecee003453ac24","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2752755,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank Ole Kaipai","original_name":"Frank Ole Kaipai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f429cde99d5c30033b8404e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2752756,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adam Ole Mwarabu","original_name":"Adam Ole Mwarabu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f429d05e8601700345657f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2752747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelly Askew","original_name":"Kelly Askew","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f429d3f477215003362aa86","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1200714,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Mulvihill","original_name":"Ron Mulvihill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa7883a813831004099e4b2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p53wC2AcWZUMNMW1tGnU9xJEAVU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2520,"name":"tanzania"},{"id":249068,"name":"maasai"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
