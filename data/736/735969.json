There are three sections, each of which is set to one piece of synthetic choral/electronic music that I composed. . . Within each section the images repeat in blocks of five frames at a time, and gradually advance one frame at a time for each block. The result of this simple pattern interacting with the imagery is a fascinating study of ordinary street life.\" (Gregg Biermann)","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New York Gradual","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1436569,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregg Biermann","original_name":"Gregg Biermann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f42b556477215003560eb94","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"National Gallery of Art - New York Pavements: Short Films from the Collection of the Film-Makers' Cooperatives","release_date":"2020-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
