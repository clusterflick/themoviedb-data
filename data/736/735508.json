It was commissioned by the Japanese authorities to director Toyojirō Takamatsu (1872–1952) in 1907, twelve years after Japan occupied Taiwan, as a propaganda movie showing the progress of Taiwan under Japanese rule. The film is lost, but it is known from reviews in local newspapers that it featured a long staged scene of Japanese military repressing a revolt by Taiwanese indigenous people. The aboriginal theme reportedly occupied the longer part of the film. Others were devoted to depicting scenic locations, and the production of \"exotic\" goods such as bananas and coconuts. The film was criticized for presenting a romantic, exotic, and colonial view of Taiwan, ignoring its more modern industrial products and social problems.","popularity":0.09,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":139002,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taiwan Dōjinsha","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1907-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":220,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Introduction to the Actual Condition of Taiwan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2557979,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toyojiro Takamatsu","original_name":"Toyojiro Takamatsu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4125246a34480036b2ca13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Part 1 (Asahi-za Theatre, Taipei)","release_date":"1907-05-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Part 2 (Asahi-za Theatre, Taipei)","release_date":"1907-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
