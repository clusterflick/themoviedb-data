She is roughly cut out from her surroundings by a computer algorithm struggling to contain her. Her enemies are rubbed off the frame, sound is removed and music added, emphasising her anguish and anger. Is she real? Is she a dream? Gradually, more fragments of the scene are revealed, and the context is made clearer. The video-processing highlights the documented scene as image, both of a fight for freedom, and a media event.\" (Guli Silberstein)","popularity":0.2082,"poster_path":"/F8xeT6Nh3N7FZDdieqkhxaVCeU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2014-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cut Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1825299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guli Silberstein","original_name":"Guli Silberstein","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/gz9uRztvQT7lQzaAc030EmhO6qv.jpg","credit_id":"5f412f3c3bd26e003681f040","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4155862","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/F8xeT6Nh3N7FZDdieqkhxaVCeU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jihlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2014-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Guli Silberstein - Vimeo","release_date":"2014-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Go Short International Film Festival","release_date":"2015-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Currents","release_date":"2019-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival of (In)Appropriation #9","release_date":"2020-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
