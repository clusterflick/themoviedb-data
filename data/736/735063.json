The author's approach to his twelve-year-old self is articulated through a mosaic of vacation videos found in an old family camera. These memories form a touching, nostalgic, self-parody warp, the digital remnants of a new generational sensibility.","popularity":0.1659,"poster_path":"/8NTVKyC65z4gawwC5PxTjJrJGpS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2006 the only year that i remember","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2749740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Van den Eynde","original_name":"Alberto Van den Eynde","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3f62a3028f140033582233","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10402558","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8NTVKyC65z4gawwC5PxTjJrJGpS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":170487,"name":"essay film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Besides the Screen","release_date":"2020-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FILMADRID","release_date":"2019-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
