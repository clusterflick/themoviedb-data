He is about to start on some expedition of crime and his wife implores him to stay at home. She receives a beating for her trouble. Jim, a cowboy, rides past the shack, hears Mrs. Gray's screams and interferes, and takes Mrs. Gray over to his friend, the postmaster, so that she may have a good home. \"Wild Bill\" plans vengeance. Paxton, the postmaster, starts for the station with money and gold, and is accompanied a short way by Jim. Gray sneaks after them. After going with Paxton a short distance, Jim takes a turn in the road and Paxton rides on alone. Gray closes up on the postmaster, gets the drop on him, but Paxton is quick and there's a hand-to-hand struggle. Bill, however, worsts Paxton, and finally sends him over a precipice. But in falling, Paxton falls into a tree and thus is saved from sure death.","popularity":0.1766,"poster_path":"/srpjl97zufT9LdCrKFN3Y0vIxbL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26305,"logo_path":null,"name":"Solax Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Little Rangers","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Little Rangers","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1691357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinnie Burns","original_name":"Vinnie Burns","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":"/fPQmJ38qNxz6AaUbacmbJrCZdET.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"57f8fbaf9251412525005bbb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1223501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blanche Cornwall","original_name":"Blanche Cornwall","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/aqTGfdEDULjqt4QdnaS7JtQJbe3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"57f8fbb9925141223200262d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1119397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Egan","original_name":"Gladys Egan","popularity":0.1196,"profile_path":"/vOTrPoS99wnuACgIOED2vF6FMXv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gladys - The Postmaster's Daughter","credit_id":"671ff558a4ac8a432c5cddcc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1607204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magda Foy","original_name":"Magda Foy","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":"/haDTyjAfOW4QGDBGfttY7ZLW6Ll.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"May - The Postmaster's Daughter","credit_id":"671ff563fefd1e051000b09e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1071403,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alice Guy-Blaché","original_name":"Alice Guy-Blaché","popularity":0.2645,"profile_path":"/y1atPvIVDpS2pJR2rnQZ4VR7ULM.jpg","credit_id":"57f8fb81c3a3684eca0023d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5028121,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrew Earle Simpson","original_name":"Andrew Earle Simpson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671ff57bc7802cc5035a9331","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0210810","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/srpjl97zufT9LdCrKFN3Y0vIxbL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yjFTsugAc4fXmu1T7UaDhTuMdfI.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m0nzgj6BFgNL3e52eGrPvE3Mmkl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2y2uzb96f5AAzHsxW9dZLPQRSKK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
