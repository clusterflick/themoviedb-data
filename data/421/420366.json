It is a case of opposite poles attracting. Puru is everything that Amritha is not! The boy is religious and tight-fisted in money matters. His only ambition in life: to construct a house. Amritha likes to splurge and is an atheist. In the course of time, Puru realizes his ambition, and names the dream house as Amrithadhare - a birthday gift to his beloved wife. Everything is hunky dory in their small world. But fate springs an unpleasant surprise on them. Amritha is diagnosed as having brain cancer, and the doctor tells Puru that her days are numbered! A shocked Puru decides to make her remaining days as happy as possible. He takes her on a Bharat darshan. In the process, Amritha realizes a long-standing wish of hers too: to meet her favourite actor Amitabh Bachchan in Mumbai, who makes an appearance in the climax.","popularity":0.1958,"poster_path":"/nSBnLe5uCXkuMlGOteWKrxlFfRO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82208,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nagathihalli Cine Creations","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2005-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":144,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kannada","iso_639_1":"kn","name":"?????"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amrithadhare","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":237654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Divya Spandana","original_name":"Divya Spandana","popularity":0.2712,"profile_path":"/1x44IzPe189q4GK6lOE2SIOIaEg.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"57fa6e02925141212b008e18","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amitabh Bachchan","original_name":"Amitabh Bachchan","popularity":1.2497,"profile_path":"/u69PvpWqGkywSm0YjFiw77j9eqS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (Special Appearance)","credit_id":"57fa6e0f9251411fb3008649","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1342977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bhavya","original_name":"Bhavya","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/jshrKexXLJ0aJzWnomu5KSqyfSw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"57fa6e4bc3a3686fff009d02","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1179742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avinash","original_name":"Avinash","popularity":0.3679,"profile_path":"/uvDw1elYkPDooFNnq6yHJKBhz6s.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"57fa6e6a9251412128008b06","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1692030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raju Ananthaswamy","original_name":"Raju Ananthaswamy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"57fa6e76c3a3681b7f007457","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sammir Dattani","original_name":"Sammir Dattani","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":"/3FxU6Yhf1t2XFBIvUb56iL3FdPl.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5971f9dbc3a3687c7d00eada","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ganesh","original_name":"Ganesh","popularity":0.2543,"profile_path":"/Ah2FN5wkNevFlSAPIJGsleTM9cM.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"597dbed0c3a3685440014a6c","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343061,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mano Murthy","original_name":"Mano Murthy","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fa6ed1c3a3686fff009d43","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nagathihalli Chandrashekar","original_name":"Nagathihalli Chandrashekar","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fa6ea3925141212b008e7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramesh Aravind","original_name":"Ramesh Aravind","popularity":0.1947,"profile_path":"/hXGIyDB974E4on7B7mCJYWpMfzn.jpg","credit_id":"57fa6eb2c3a3681b8f007b78","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0889168","wikidata_id":"Q4748690","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"kn","file_path":"/nSBnLe5uCXkuMlGOteWKrxlFfRO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":667},{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/n3Cxx7EcEl4hihTsV56feYmq05A.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":563}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"kn","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
