Construction noise drones away in the background, clinking crockery, a broom sweeping over tiled floors, an expressive façade of countless adjustable panes of glass covered by a patina. It’s October 2016 and a group of young people are preparing a preview of Bickels [Socialism]. The venue is to form a prologue to the completed film, which tours 22 buildings in Israel designed by Samuel Bickels, most of which for kibbutzim. Dining halls, children’s houses, agricultural buildings, bright structures inserted into the Mediterranean landscape with great ingenuity. An architecture with a sell-by date: That many are now empty or have been repurposed at best is linked to the decline of the socialist ideals they embody.","popularity":0.1089,"poster_path":"/7l3LMzod0pJoDIlOlyne1jwOGYW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75499,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pym Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bickels [Socialism]","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2078900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Galia Bar Or","original_name":"Galia Bar Or","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"5b3e8ac4c3a36867050019d9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Emigholz","original_name":"Heinz Emigholz","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":"/lHMPlkrIiRGV5j1uQyTEON0lhVl.jpg","credit_id":"57fa1629925141016400661c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323420,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jochen Jezussek","original_name":"Jochen Jezussek","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3e8b2c0e0a2626fe00193d","department":"Crew","job":"Mixing Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713653,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christian Obermaier","original_name":"Christian Obermaier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3e8afec3a368670a001e3c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1378020,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Till Beckmann","original_name":"Till Beckmann","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3e8ae7c3a36866fc0018d6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1378020,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Till Beckmann","original_name":"Till Beckmann","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4578b9c3a3684efb0003fb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Emigholz","original_name":"Heinz Emigholz","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":"/lHMPlkrIiRGV5j1uQyTEON0lhVl.jpg","credit_id":"5b4578a50e0a266058000331","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Emigholz","original_name":"Heinz Emigholz","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":"/lHMPlkrIiRGV5j1uQyTEON0lhVl.jpg","credit_id":"5b45789392514168f3000327","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1378020,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Till Beckmann","original_name":"Till Beckmann","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b4578b00e0a266047000312","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554449,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Emigholz","original_name":"Heinz Emigholz","popularity":0.1601,"profile_path":"/lHMPlkrIiRGV5j1uQyTEON0lhVl.jpg","credit_id":"5b45789c92514168c9000330","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8609368","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7l3LMzod0pJoDIlOlyne1jwOGYW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":667},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4EFYklvI9HEUCmNn05cbQEdif4H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
