Partly inspired by Joseph Conrad’s modernist literary masterpiece Heart of Darkness, the visceral and moving work was filmed in the Democratic Republic of Congo using 16mm colour infra-red film, which captures otherwise invisible parts of the spectrum. The resulting imagery in Mosse’s work is hallucinatory and dream-like with the usual greens of jungle and forest replaced by shimmering violet. The Enclave depicts a complicated, strife-ridden place in a way that reflects its complexity, using a strategy of beauty and transfixion to combat the wider invisibility of a conflict that has claimed so many.","popularity":0.3573,"poster_path":"/wJMBa2XHuvEhqVz5Qen6FmmYJqp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2013-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Enclave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","title":"Hólmlendan","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693742,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Mosse","original_name":"Richard Mosse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fed846c3a3685dfe001402","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1683,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wJMBa2XHuvEhqVz5Qen6FmmYJqp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2521,"name":"congo"},{"id":158697,"name":"installation"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
