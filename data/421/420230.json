In a wonderful mix of fiction, archival footage, processed interviews and soap opera drama, the film tells the story of Claudia Marin, a middle-class, light-skinned, lesbian Puerto Rican photographer / videographer who is attempting to construct a sense of community in the US. Confronting the simultaneity of both her privilege and her oppression, this experimental narrative becomes a meditation on class, race, and sexuality as shifting differences.","popularity":0.0716,"poster_path":"/4uwNFbf7kDsxIBShLLYJvYjQ256.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82197,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hipsic Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"PR","name":"Puerto Rico"}],"release_date":"1994-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brincando el Charco: Portrait of a Puerto Rican","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1691769,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frances Negrón Muntaner","original_name":"Frances Negrón Muntaner","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Claudia","credit_id":"57f9c97ec3a3681a29003761","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1691770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalia Lazarus","original_name":"Natalia Lazarus","popularity":0.1007,"profile_path":"/rACef403KeLXxzcrI1m61rCNTUl.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"57f9c9a7c3a3686fed0044e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1691771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zulma González","original_name":"Zulma González","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"57f9c9ce9251411fd3003739","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1691772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Cade Bambara","original_name":"Toni Cade Bambara","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"57f9c9ef92514101620045dd","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1691769,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frances Negrón Muntaner","original_name":"Frances Negrón Muntaner","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f9c9069251411fb300373d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1691769,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frances Negrón Muntaner","original_name":"Frances Negrón Muntaner","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f9c8f692514120f90037af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1691769,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frances Negrón Muntaner","original_name":"Frances Negrón Muntaner","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f9c920c3a3681b7f002f44","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2864,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jim Denault","original_name":"Jim Denault","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f9d5b7c3a3681a29003d20","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1691786,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jay Fluellen","original_name":"Jay Fluellen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f9d6b2c3a3681b7f00345e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1691785,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Loyda Camacho","original_name":"Loyda Camacho","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f9d686c3a3686fed004af0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1691783,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chris Emmanouilides","original_name":"Chris Emmanouilides","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f9d5e6c3a3686fff004f60","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1691784,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Valerie Keller","original_name":"Valerie Keller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f9d64e9251411fd3003ccf","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13766690","wikidata_id":"Q27989853","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4uwNFbf7kDsxIBShLLYJvYjQ256.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Brincando El Charco: Portrait of a Puerto Rican [excerpt]","key":"25111783","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-06-15T00:52:25.000Z","id":"669fa5495d3c2bce4f6e7f48"}]}}}
