Thomsen gives an account of brief memories of childhood in a deliberately \"staged\" fashion, but more particularly of his experience of writing and on the art of reading aloud, and likewise describing poetry in general as a balance between emotion and cognition.","popularity":0.1095,"poster_path":"/ltdH9qW2rxf5DMPyW0e0nlPoRWL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Alive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Søren Ulrik Thomsen","original_name":"Søren Ulrik Thomsen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"57fd862ec3a3681ec50015dc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jørgen Leth","original_name":"Jørgen Leth","popularity":0.19,"profile_path":"/nyegklYsfvx8RnMjRdX4DfMIPVC.jpg","credit_id":"57fd8564c3a368193100173d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693236,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Annette Nørregaard-Jensen","original_name":"Annette Nørregaard-Jensen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fd8589c3a3681de6001704","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jørgen Leth","original_name":"Jørgen Leth","popularity":0.19,"profile_path":"/nyegklYsfvx8RnMjRdX4DfMIPVC.jpg","credit_id":"57fd856c9251410b1700172b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72356,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dan Holmberg","original_name":"Dan Holmberg","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64512c1ce942ee0e36eca9df","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ltdH9qW2rxf5DMPyW0e0nlPoRWL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
