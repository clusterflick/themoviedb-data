The Pakistani government spends seven times more on its military than on education. The Taliban banned girls from attending school. Pakistan’s literacy rate is among the lowest in the world, with the number of school aged children who don’t attend school is second highest globally.  Malala survived and is now the youngest person to ever be awarded the Nobel peace Prize for her activism for female education. This is the story of Malala’s fight for a right to education and freedom.","popularity":0.2506,"poster_path":"/DIxagbcvDhqEYaoA7MS1VihcSy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82255,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frontline Media Pakistan","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","name":"Pakistan"}],"release_date":"2013-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"“Education is our basic right.”","title":"MALALA: A Girl From Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1463952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malala Yousafzai","original_name":"Malala Yousafzai","popularity":0.4689,"profile_path":"/rvykLT5LRre5bzTa047TbCIrlIP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57fc95c4c3a36819ae00478b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1692843,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohsin Abbas","original_name":"Mohsin Abbas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fc95a29251411786004750","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1692843,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohsin Abbas","original_name":"Mohsin Abbas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fc9596c3a368440f005ddd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1692843,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohsin Abbas","original_name":"Mohsin Abbas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fc95aac3a3681b3f00426a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/DIxagbcvDhqEYaoA7MS1VihcSy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7021,"name":"pakistan"},{"id":229902,"name":"malala"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Malala: A Girl from Paradise  (Official Film Trailer)","key":"k1Z3EdX1INI","published_at":"2013-09-28T10:55:00.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"57fc95edc3a3681b3f004287"}]}}}
