It is an opportunity for him to look back over his relationship with her: a relationship that made him a free individual, as a man and as a filmmaker. The second night is the final part of a trilogy that began with Letter from a filmmaker to his daughter, which was followed by Dreaming films. The making of this \" Cabin Trilogy\" is the fruit of fifteen years of work and reflection.","popularity":0.1571,"poster_path":"/7bVEqq3XpTGYwEMiMLVewbq8TLJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56959,"logo_path":null,"name":"Associate Directors","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":11796,"logo_path":"/tx6LOQcTSqgW8ffKxovuJHjlYVw.png","name":"Centre du Cinéma et de l'Audiovisuel de la FWB","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":84352,"logo_path":"/jCluvAPVwESTEP012VHYmmAPrgs.png","name":"Stenola Productions","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2016-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Second Night","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2349399,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anton Iffland Stettner","original_name":"Anton Iffland Stettner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655802ceea84c710959eb112","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54204,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adrian Politowski","original_name":"Adrian Politowski","popularity":0.2562,"profile_path":"/hqE3d8hi08RnY3JaYwCuHZoG7zi.jpg","credit_id":"655802d67f054018d78f2222","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2349400,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eva Kuperman","original_name":"Eva Kuperman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655802e00816c700fd31629e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1694460,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rudi Maerten","original_name":"Rudi Maerten","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655802ec7f054018d6f348b1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Pauwels","original_name":"Eric Pauwels","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/eYHwWVHhgOyYfFKVlZOHqfNK9Tp.jpg","credit_id":"57f8e1de925141237b001919","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Pauwels","original_name":"Eric Pauwels","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/eYHwWVHhgOyYfFKVlZOHqfNK9Tp.jpg","credit_id":"5cd2ef7f9251417be12aac9d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5501166","wikidata_id":"Q27042882","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gxjDzsLeStC0SmsPiGxDCzVBqQe.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Ze7zmktvWUgnKluASMcrHMfuur.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tG3jmvbI8MLJTBrydZEnle8g4YY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1040,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/7bVEqq3XpTGYwEMiMLVewbq8TLJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":693},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/pxrX1hTQ0ag2yQFFLwuwJx661Et.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
