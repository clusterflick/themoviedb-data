It is only the second film made by Robert Gardner and tries to show in cinematic language how this man looked at the world; Mark Tobey himself both performs and is observed. A unique film in the Gardner ouvre, the film not only presents an experimental portrait of Tobey but serves as a window into the American art, avant garde film and poetic movements of this period.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/3CqoUXw8HxNdeFAQev7vRKnekhD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1952-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mark Tobey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1601664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Gardner","original_name":"Robert Gardner","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f84793c3a3685f3500104a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3CqoUXw8HxNdeFAQev7vRKnekhD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
