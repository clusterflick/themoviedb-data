It tells about a man facing the challenges of the epoch and dramatically searching for his space. Wróblewski, seen through the eyes of Wajda, is a genius who had to wait a long time for recognition, but also did not fully recognize his own greatness. Their paths crossed right after the war, when they both studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow. Born in Vilnius, the young artist studied at the faculty of painting and sculpture, he also studied art history at the Jagiellonian University.  The film was produced on the occasion of the exhibition of the same title organized at the Manggha Museum of Japanese Art and Technology in Krakow in 2015.","popularity":0.1729,"poster_path":"/8a46rZe0A21A7nJW8MR9xK38Ose.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2016-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wróblewski According to Wajda","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1071418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marek Brodzki","original_name":"Marek Brodzki","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/eL825XMat9YHvwZEVHwayfJUG9A.jpg","credit_id":"6207c769db154f001cdab8c3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2220186,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jerzy Rudziński","original_name":"Jerzy Rudziński","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6207c79cefd3c2008f5cd65f","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrzej Wajda","original_name":"Andrzej Wajda","popularity":0.2899,"profile_path":"/4agiSYoIv95N1bK3wod1GzWfiFb.jpg","credit_id":"6207c7581d78f23c5a0f8b92","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2503238,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kamil Czwartosz","original_name":"Kamil Czwartosz","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6207cadaae6f09009bbe9ead","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrzej Wajda","original_name":"Andrzej Wajda","popularity":0.2899,"profile_path":"/4agiSYoIv95N1bK3wod1GzWfiFb.jpg","credit_id":"57fa0bd992514101620061bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18229646","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"pl","file_path":"/8a46rZe0A21A7nJW8MR9xK38Ose.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Molodist Kyiv International Film Festival","release_date":"2017-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Wróblewski według Wajdy\" | teaser","key":"zlKTVV3UyWw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-10-11T12:40:35.000Z","id":"6207c66ac92c5d01159d5f0c"}]}}}
