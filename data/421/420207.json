Shot over a year, co-directors Nicolas Lachapelle and Ariel St-Louis Lamoureux follow a group of children through their daily life. A generous and human meditation on identity and place that's unfettered by an issue-driven hook or an imposed narrative, this is the rare sort of film that transcends categorization, becoming a beautiful work of art to behold.","popularity":0.1549,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cree","iso_639_1":"cr","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lights Above Water","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1691727,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Lachapelle","original_name":"Nicolas Lachapelle","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fcz9cIcoWttIbFTj88ULd1ySVm.jpg","credit_id":"57f993dfc3a3686fed00255d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1691728,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ariel St-Louis Lamoureux","original_name":"Ariel St-Louis Lamoureux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f99404c3a3686fff0027bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":"Q56479640","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
