Haligo Laderez, a wealthy Mexican, also has his eye on Bonita. When he sees that Bonita is favoring Hardwell, he invites the gang of Mexicans working for Hardwell to strike for more money. They are refused, so Haligo sets about capturing Hardwell, who has escaped and is on his way to the sheriff. As he is making his way through a narrow railway cut, Hardwell is hemmed in at both sides by Haligo's men, so he takes refuge behind a barricade of rocks. Unable to get at Hardwell, Haligo places a can of gun powder in front of the rocks and lights the fuse. Just before the flame reaches the can, Bonita and the sheriff arrive, putting the Mexicans to flight. The next day Bonita's father agrees to let her become the wife of Hardwell.","popularity":0.2207,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1912-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Question of Seconds","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Ogle","original_name":"Charles Ogle","popularity":0.2381,"profile_path":"/hmSOnMuub9xJ606MsSZEqJg4fXG.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Jim Collins - the Ranchman","credit_id":"57f8bab7c3a36850d800061f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":28972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Fuller","original_name":"Mary Fuller","popularity":0.0939,"profile_path":"/7XIkKyvcJ8aEmhZNctVOjDCudMH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bonita - the Ranchman's Daughter","credit_id":"57f8bac89251412387000618","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1140593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harold M.
