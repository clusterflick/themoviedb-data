The great impulse of his career came in 1943, with the Consolidation of Labor Laws, promulgated by Getúlio Vargas. By making mandatory a professional card with photo, Vargas gave the push that the working class needed to enter Horta's photographic studio. In the years that followed, the photographer portrayed hundreds of people. In 3x4 or full-length, many took their first portrait.","popularity":0.1297,"poster_path":"/6x9wAC3QPpiH0pvBzD3ja4E1Wo3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138937,"logo_path":null,"name":"IMS - Instituto Moreira Salles","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2015-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Clique Único de Assis Horta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Bodanzky","original_name":"Jorge Bodanzky","popularity":0.0665,"profile_path":"/w01npJr3kIhsSeKFyCWrCi9J3EH.jpg","credit_id":"62a730947e12f00e26016ca4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2076983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruna Callegari","original_name":"Bruna Callegari","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a7307935d1bc32d8c75ba8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3586806,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marcos Lazzeti","original_name":"Marcos Lazzeti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a730a6a8b2ca0052c4e37c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2268817,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marcia Bodanzky","original_name":"Marcia Bodanzky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a730b23d4d9617e86a1d91","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2076983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruna Callegari","original_name":"Bruna Callegari","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62a7308505b54973b006cac0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Bodanzky","original_name":"Jorge Bodanzky","popularity":0.0665,"profile_path":"/w01npJr3kIhsSeKFyCWrCi9J3EH.jpg","credit_id":"57fa1b2e9251411fd3005bbe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":924,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6x9wAC3QPpiH0pvBzD3ja4E1Wo3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":616}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
