The monotony of their lives is stirred by the arrival in the neighborhood of a hunting party, about to enter the jungle to secure wild animals for an American circus. Henry Barium, the young circus owner, heads the party. He prevails on old John Brant to accompany him on the trip and, in turn, agrees that Gene and Jan Karl shall join the expedition. Jan and Gene are \"as good as engaged.\" as the saying goes. Young Barium pays marked attention to Gene as they journey, and Jan grows jealous. One day he comes on the young people when Barium is trying to force a kiss from Gene. In the trial of strength that follows, Barium is worsted. Gene, who loves Jan, does not show that worthy due appreciation of his interference, with the result that he leaves the expedition for the Transvaal mines. Next day a noble, shaggy-maned lion is caught.","popularity":0.1718,"poster_path":"/eG6cvaFcLvNmaEOz64At2EIfmqF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thor, Lord of the Jungles","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1064961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathlyn Williams","original_name":"Kathlyn Williams","popularity":0.096,"profile_path":"/j8BcTXV2h98p04pYjRLtEe9LHvV.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Gene Brant","credit_id":"57f8ec98c3a3684eca001d08","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Clary","original_name":"Charles Clary","popularity":0.2506,"profile_path":"/nAEqw3M130Wco0N1g0IVFWFvUE6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Henry Barlum","credit_id":"57f8eca6c3a3684eca001d12","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Santschi","original_name":"Tom Santschi","popularity":0.2595,"profile_path":"/8TCS8pRx9LjfFXApYZZReYpTFpa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jan Karl","credit_id":"57f8ecb5925141236d001f9f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lafe McKee","original_name":"Lafe McKee","popularity":0.1904,"profile_path":"/iDR6BFkx3vJY9dN3LA3bNTAK24J.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"John Brant - Gene's Father","credit_id":"57f8ecc7c3a3685094001a77","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":7655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Holland","original_name":"William Holland","popularity":0.0883,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Billie - the Hunchback","credit_id":"57f8ecd7925141223e001dfe","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Campbell","original_name":"Colin Campbell","popularity":0.316,"profile_path":"/dGmWZLBzh1sQSTNDgRU1itpeYu5.jpg","credit_id":"59ce9504c3a3686a2301e717","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24426,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Oliver Curwood","original_name":"James Oliver Curwood","popularity":0.1485,"profile_path":"/8hhzku4GGUdcsOVrydWrtcFr6NW.jpg","credit_id":"645e898e9590e300e3a2d133","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward McWade","original_name":"Edward McWade","popularity":0.0874,"profile_path":"/zS9uHDYCczWEUenSfjnCa5zolZh.jpg","credit_id":"645e899d88b14801756715f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0003451","wikidata_id":"Q3525791","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eG6cvaFcLvNmaEOz64At2EIfmqF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
