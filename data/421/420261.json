Inspired by modern philosophy and ancient Jewish texts, Levinas developed the  “humanism of the other”, in which people are called to listen to “the silent word of the human face”. This film juxtaposes the philosophy of Levinas with the Israeli reality of 2012, where seculars and religious, Muslims and Jews, poor and rich – live in a permanent conflict under a sky of an absent God.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/efJ2pOPf6uG4GcLqTD0GYz9QVlM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Absent God – Emmanuel Levinas and the Humanism of the Other","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431936,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yoram Ron","original_name":"Yoram Ron","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6AQpUcGzhiIHNgdwXy6Zbue06fB.jpg","credit_id":"57fa1344c3a36818af004dfa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431936,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yoram Ron","original_name":"Yoram Ron","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6AQpUcGzhiIHNgdwXy6Zbue06fB.jpg","credit_id":"57fa1353c3a3686ffa006ad2","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207187,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nadav Harel","original_name":"Nadav Harel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fa138d92514120c50054ca","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431936,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yoram Ron","original_name":"Yoram Ron","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/6AQpUcGzhiIHNgdwXy6Zbue06fB.jpg","credit_id":"57fa13319251410162006614","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207187,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nadav Harel","original_name":"Nadav Harel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fa13979251411fb300569d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1691871,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Didi Erez","original_name":"Didi Erez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fa13b6c3a3686ffa006b1d","department":"Crew","job":"Compositors"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/efJ2pOPf6uG4GcLqTD0GYz9QVlM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":685}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
