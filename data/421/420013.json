One night the crew killed him, and marooned the mate and the captain's daughter by sending them adrift in a small boat. Days passed upon the vast expanse of ocean, and their food was all gone and death near, when land was sighted and their boat was cast up on a coral reef, and they with difficulty made the shore. Fear of death was soon supplanted in the heart of the captain's daughter by fear of a man loving her all too well. The mate, seeing this and realizing the strength of his passion, decided to live on the side of the island, but as the months passed away his loneliness overcame him and he made his way to where she sat reading. He looked over her shoulder, and saw that she read the marriage service.","popularity":0.248,"poster_path":"/9Q5X7XaXmHUUd4UbgpNFmR70fjr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mate of the Alden Bessie","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Clark","original_name":"Frank Clark","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The Ship's Captain","credit_id":"57f81e1ac3a3682608004b01","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1690990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bessie Eyton","original_name":"Bessie Eyton","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":"/sWsS8cXywwkbyEpZacZoHQx9oT8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Captain's Daughter","credit_id":"57f81e2b92514116f1001857","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hobart Bosworth","original_name":"Hobart Bosworth","popularity":0.2715,"profile_path":"/embweEOzbEdv3FgNikIgv6ZoTS1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The First Mate","credit_id":"57f81e39c3a368248b004170","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Santschi","original_name":"Tom Santschi","popularity":0.2595,"profile_path":"/8TCS8pRx9LjfFXApYZZReYpTFpa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The 'Sea Lawyer'","credit_id":"57f81e49c3a3682608004b13","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Opperman","original_name":"Frank Opperman","popularity":0.1082,"profile_path":"/hHwmtTj7qfE8Aquzpv8MOkgRQ3k.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Man at the Wheel","credit_id":"57f81e64c3a36875b0001622","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1470748,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Harte","original_name":"Betty Harte","popularity":0.0716,"profile_path":"/l4KURSLnpC1LkRybiCqB6OBrWkK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"57f81e72c3a3682608004b28","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hobart Bosworth","original_name":"Hobart Bosworth","popularity":0.2715,"profile_path":"/embweEOzbEdv3FgNikIgv6ZoTS1.jpg","credit_id":"61a299e3dcb6a30092bca0fd","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hobart Bosworth","original_name":"Hobart Bosworth","popularity":0.2715,"profile_path":"/embweEOzbEdv3FgNikIgv6ZoTS1.jpg","credit_id":"57f81dfbc3a368240d0048e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0812324","wikidata_id":"Q20005431","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9Q5X7XaXmHUUd4UbgpNFmR70fjr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1912-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
