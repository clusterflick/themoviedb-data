His mother, out of work and with an unstable personal life, is incapable of taking care of him. This is why Miguel lives in a state of constant urgency, doing the housework, selling Kleenex or stealing from supermarkets. All this ends when Social Services come for him again, and his mother makes him seek refuge in the house of Bogdan, a Rumanian ex-lover of hers who lives in a nearby town. At the same time, María, the owner of a bar, sympathizes with the boy and gives him the virtually maternal treatment that he does not get in his own home. However, everything is thrust forward when the mother suddenly disappears","popularity":0.4746,"poster_path":"/sR7yrYPY0zpggsJmR0MGZCsN5Z5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3061,"logo_path":"/gseYJDkfTwGKG6qHbAa4SY9w1UV.png","name":"Alfama Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":18309,"logo_path":null,"name":"IVAC","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2016-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La madre","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laia Marull","original_name":"Laia Marull","popularity":0.1528,"profile_path":"/9UCGtbwtrgXuQSgznmXvVgKIEmQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Carmen","credit_id":"5820cdc892514120610008fa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nieve de Medina","original_name":"Nieve de Medina","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/eUciOKs4nXkDyr6MPnT7tHn5ri8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mara","credit_id":"5820cddcc3a368218f000880","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Caballero","original_name":"Sergio Caballero","popularity":0.124,"profile_path":"/qT6efqyEcVnO9hNA1iLOIYcUViX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Luis","credit_id":"5820ce07925141207300098c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1942490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javier Mendo","original_name":"Javier Mendo","popularity":0.1215,"profile_path":"/1gHAvo2e6i5flW5QPbIFTATqjrF.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Miguel","credit_id":"5a35a70fc3a3680b8d1ca5f9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1942491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Albiñana","original_name":"María Albiñana","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/z2ODQmirfhSCllzmTxWRkf2rR6y.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"La profesora","credit_id":"5a35a73992514154750427cc","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Verónica García","original_name":"Verónica García","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/qLR0UneJ0x9EUKQA9QeyJNLoEKU.jpg","credit_id":"6262a25657530e0a735df2bd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2873507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Gutiérrez-Solana","original_name":"Ignacio Gutiérrez-Solana","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6262a231f48e0d009c81aebd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1074938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Morais","original_name":"Alberto Morais","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6262a24257530e0a742870f4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1074938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Morais","original_name":"Alberto Morais","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fa432a9251410162007fa8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4846408","wikidata_id":"Q54847553","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/bul08sVJvRqhebHkPcBSt52kMaL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/qiZ6N8AcOEeXnrGN2wiKUKyFZQe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/itHHn883hqUqqzRubPgwwxhOvgQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sR7yrYPY0zpggsJmR0MGZCsN5Z5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
