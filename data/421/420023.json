Pretty Dolores wanders one day without the Plaza El Torres, hoping to get one peep at the wonderful animals. Juan, a young Mexican employed at the Plaza, sees the girl and attracted by her beauty, offers to show her the bulls. He takes her within the Plaza and shows her all the interesting sights. The young people are mutually interested in each other and it proves a case of love at first sight. Alonzo also meets the girl and proposes for her hand. While Dolores loves Juan, she is quickly given to understand by her parents that Alonzo is a much more desirable match and that she must give up poor Juan. This Dolores reluctantly agrees to do. Finally the eventful day arrives. Alonzo, however, reaches the Plaza far too drunk to enter the arena and the management is in despair.","popularity":0.081,"poster_path":"/zJBohuDvhV94qjpqfBwbqbWKwUt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29949,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lubin Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Mexican Courtship","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1319901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romaine Fielding","original_name":"Romaine Fielding","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/gVV2zvcJKClTnHEqoS62VDS5iiJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Juan","credit_id":"57f823e8c3a36875b0001801","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1321525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edna Payne","original_name":"Edna Payne","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dolores","credit_id":"57f823fac3a36874fe0018e4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1153824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Burton L.
