The sorrow-stricken mother gazes at the empty cradle and decides to replace the departed soul with an orphan child upon whom she can lavish the love, the rightful object of which the Great Giver and Taker has taken from her. She goes to the orphanage and asks to be given a baby girl, and is given one of the twin baby sisters. Richard Golden, a wealthy shirtwaist manufacturer, has an only son, a little boy, who yearns for a sister and continually begs his father to bring him a little sister to be a playmate to him, and the father, to satisfy the child's persistent pleading, goes to the orphan home and brings home the other little twin sister. Years roll by and both girls have grown to young womanhood in their different stations in life. Jack Golden, now grown to manhood, and knowing that the girl is only a foster sister, asks her to become his wife.","popularity":0.1669,"poster_path":"/gEiSfya6YT1bMx0BxchXUwLmE15.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Twins","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lois Weber","original_name":"Lois Weber","popularity":0.2365,"profile_path":"/c6YcUHNxlP9Fo5cxbJJQi3xAdGF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Twin Sisters","credit_id":"5d5c21918d22fc0014189dbd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillips Smalley","original_name":"Phillips Smalley","popularity":0.1997,"profile_path":"/wqmmEk0TPELGnDgVOSXGM8YYzJ2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jack Golden","credit_id":"5de7b11b11386c001655b4c7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lois Weber","original_name":"Lois Weber","popularity":0.2365,"profile_path":"/c6YcUHNxlP9Fo5cxbJJQi3xAdGF.jpg","credit_id":"5d5c218c8d22fc0015189c21","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037794,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lois Weber","original_name":"Lois Weber","popularity":0.2365,"profile_path":"/c6YcUHNxlP9Fo5cxbJJQi3xAdGF.jpg","credit_id":"5d5c217df29d66001518c7e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillips Smalley","original_name":"Phillips Smalley","popularity":0.1997,"profile_path":"/wqmmEk0TPELGnDgVOSXGM8YYzJ2.jpg","credit_id":"5d5c2186f29d66001418c894","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1226330","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gEiSfya6YT1bMx0BxchXUwLmE15.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4taQmTzR4PjvnaHdTeTxU9Q8um.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1911-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
