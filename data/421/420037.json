He is very cranky and very gouty. Henry Hawkins, a young coster, and Bill Brown, a teacher of boxing, and an ex-pugilist, are both in love with Liza. Old Clayton favors Bill, because he is well off. Liza likes Henry, and they meet down near the old church and do their love-making. Bill lays siege to Liza, offering her presents, which she refuses. At last he offers to take her to a music hall and she yields and goes with him. There they are seen by Hawkins, who becomes furiously jealous and upbraids Liza. She loses her temper and claims the right to do as she likes. Henry on this swears he will fight Bill, and Liza tells him not to be a fool, that Bill could lick him with one hand, and they part in anger. Hawkins meets Bill and challenges him. The result is a foregone conclusion. Poor Hawkins is knocked out and laid up in bed for repairs, tended by his landlady.","popularity":0.1119,"poster_path":"/lqRHFCNisqwZzCqV47ipRhqnF83.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mrs. 'Enry 'Awkins","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Costello","original_name":"Maurice Costello","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":"/92Q6cg7efdgMrmNbGNXBoF2hrpB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"'Enry Awkins","credit_id":"57f836b9925141699a0004d6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norma Talmadge","original_name":"Norma Talmadge","popularity":0.1066,"profile_path":"/h8ES1kk8EEByz34sKaWMDyB6Ntv.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Liza - Mrs. 'Enry 'Awkins","credit_id":"57f836cd925141699a0004e4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van Dyke Brooke","original_name":"Van Dyke Brooke","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/srLqffFE7o3SrBJPFwf9zLRb5g8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Liza's Old Father","credit_id":"57f836dcc3a3685f3500045c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1056790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry T.
