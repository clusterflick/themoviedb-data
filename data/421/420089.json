The doctor and Audrey, eating together, talk over old times and renew their friendship; she takes his attentions seriously and becomes very much impressed with his pleasant companionship. Night after night the doctor attends the performance in which she appears as the \"headliner,\" and never fails to greet her with generous applause and a bouquet of flowers as marks of admiration. To emphasize his friendship or infatuation he sends her a string of pearls, begging her to accept it as a souvenir of happy days gone by. Through a member of the company in which she is playing, she learns that Dr. Renfrew is married, and at her friend's suggestion redirects his note back to his wife.","popularity":0.1607,"poster_path":"/l8E2uXIMElUdqtq6RjkuAuHzPw5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Show Girl","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Costello","original_name":"Maurice Costello","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":"/92Q6cg7efdgMrmNbGNXBoF2hrpB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Dr. Renfrew","credit_id":"57f8d7fa925141237b0014e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":562262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Gardner","original_name":"Helen Gardner","popularity":0.171,"profile_path":"/bHrfs217SpcLvVR2SQl0IM7dbgE.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Audrey, an Actress","credit_id":"57f8d80ac3a368311a004110","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1188030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Turner","original_name":"Florence Turner","popularity":0.0922,"profile_path":"/h08KXju3kinUqw7RviRxB0ATLYG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs. Renfrew","credit_id":"57f8d818925141234a001596","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van Dyke Brooke","original_name":"Van Dyke Brooke","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/srLqffFE7o3SrBJPFwf9zLRb5g8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"57f8d826c3a36850a40015eb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Casey","original_name":"Kenneth Casey","popularity":0.0964,"profile_path":"/80nGT9KLVWl0w0Cyh6tg9Tz4JCf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"57f8d830c3a3684f18001531","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Walker","original_name":"Lillian Walker","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":"/tr17rGWaHdq5iWJFMh9vosynoG4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"A Show Girl","credit_id":"57f8d83f925141237b0014ff","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van Dyke Brooke","original_name":"Van Dyke Brooke","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/srLqffFE7o3SrBJPFwf9zLRb5g8.jpg","credit_id":"57f8d763c3a368311a0040dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0338429","wikidata_id":"Q3989261","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/l8E2uXIMElUdqtq6RjkuAuHzPw5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":502}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1911-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
