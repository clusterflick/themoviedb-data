This film should be viewed as one would look at a painting or listen to a symphony. A dynamically quiet mood is created by the interplay between the densely structured sound track and complex figure/ground relationships in the images. The subjective point of view of a porch swing through a partially opened door is the image to which we constantly return as the tonic, the drone that is always present but not always perceived.","popularity":0.0848,"poster_path":"/gJQ0Ioix2zDTBdZTgwmEqInuyOo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Swing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1274375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leighton Pierce","original_name":"Leighton Pierce","popularity":0.1203,"profile_path":"/yPQEX7xbdJmVN49JtQ8TV62RjiU.jpg","credit_id":"57fe3d5cc3a3681de6007dbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9094466","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gJQ0Ioix2zDTBdZTgwmEqInuyOo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Red Swing 1986 (from the Leighton Pierce Archive)","key":"152777807","site":"Vimeo","size":480,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2016-01-23T01:09:04.000Z","id":"63facb46cf62cd009db16d98"}]}}}
