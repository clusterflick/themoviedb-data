Staring directly into the camera, he first places multicolored gels on the lens, then projects slides of pure color. Exploring video's electronic color system, he points the camera at a monitor and adjusts the color switches, creating a chain reaction, a video \"hall of mirrors.\" Finally, he totally immerses his figure in saturated fields of electronic video color, his body ultimately submerged in the technology.","popularity":0.0504,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"R-G-B","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1660007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Campus","original_name":"Peter Campus","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"57fc9420c3a36819ae0046f4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1660007,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Campus","original_name":"Peter Campus","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57fc72c8c3a3681b3f0035ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
