Each interview discloses new clues indicating what led to the deterioration of the environment, to the biosphere, to crops and finally to the extinction of humankind. Yet though Hungry’s visuals show a possible and grim future, the interviews deliver a positive argument for action: this vicious cycle can be broken before it’s too late.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Hungry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5885840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susanne Brandstaetter","original_name":"Susanne Brandstaetter","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69448ba02cfe8cfc7a2fb157","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
