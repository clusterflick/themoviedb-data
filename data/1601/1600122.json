This tornado ripped through the Cherry Hills subdivision and went on to impact the north side of Fairdale Illinois. The tornado was given an official rating of EF4 with maximum windspeeds of 200 mph, which was extremely controversial because the EF5 rating starts at 201 mph, just one mph faster. This means that the Rochelle tornado is officially the strongest tornado that wasn’t rated EF5.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vFtcV8gZ5so219zyio5xCRTCAOR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Strongest Tornado That Wasn't Rated EF5","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vFtcV8gZ5so219zyio5xCRTCAOR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
