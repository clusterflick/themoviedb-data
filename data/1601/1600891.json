It suggests that every individual space is susceptible to this pollution. The central idea advocates acknowledging our current reality and taking initial steps to improve it, preventing the repetition of the same mistakes for future generations. The proposed solution focuses on starting with a basic action – reducing the use of plastic bags. The concept encourages individuals to recognize their role in the issue and emphasizes that by collectively making small changes, such as eliminating plastic bags, we can free ourselves from the metaphorical plastic mask covering our environment. This approach aims to create awareness and instigate a positive shift toward a cleaner and more sustainable future.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/dfHH0wttXEmSA927wYC4ZvIXrYy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":283691,"logo_path":null,"name":"Still learning films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It’s Time To Change!","title":"Plastic Heads","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5886879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohamed Sanadidy","original_name":"Mohamed Sanadidy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/h2MofzSjhyWBZpP0rCW0gvu9xOP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"69455d1977daef1d782fb39c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5886889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Belal Gamal","original_name":"Belal Gamal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/h4hQKixpKJwc9jsR7CIVVDxkgoP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"69455f79ea775d1468b1bdab","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5886831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mouhamed Hesham","original_name":"Mouhamed Hesham","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/57x0ypcnueURShtu3CO9fkWuUYi.jpg","credit_id":"69455d80c1eaf926bafb0647","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5886889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Belal Gamal","original_name":"Belal Gamal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/h4hQKixpKJwc9jsR7CIVVDxkgoP.jpg","credit_id":"69455dccc4780926b2072752","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5886892,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marwan Ahmed","original_name":"Marwan Ahmed","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69455dee1869be1085072719","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5886831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mouhamed Hesham","original_name":"Mouhamed Hesham","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/57x0ypcnueURShtu3CO9fkWuUYi.jpg","credit_id":"69455e02739bae2a6d15478f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5886831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mouhamed Hesham","original_name":"Mouhamed Hesham","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/57x0ypcnueURShtu3CO9fkWuUYi.jpg","credit_id":"69455e123a9b0e8374072601","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5886897,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Youssef Hesham","original_name":"Youssef Hesham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/e2GBYjsJkI3TgJUP3WKLzmbgqvM.jpg","credit_id":"69455e4a5692d556ee154771","department":"Art","job":"Assistant Art Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fxk29km7It5gxngyx6vXCHxosOw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dfHH0wttXEmSA927wYC4ZvIXrYy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2021-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
