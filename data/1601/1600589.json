Dreams of a mysterious glass hammer lead her to Saffron, with whom poetry, radical theory and explorations of belonging spark a new intimacy. Movements instigated by this encounter take Noa to St.Paul-de-Vence in southern France, tracing the footsteps of James Baldwin. Grief led Baldwin there decades earlier, where he established his final homespace. The house is gone now, swallowed by a gated community of luxury villas. Yet Baldwin’s legacy endures; guarded by Jill Hutchinson, partner of Baldwin’s late brother, David. In Jill’s care, Noa witnesses how it is love that holds archive. Archive moves through love, enters our bodies, and moves within us. Grief, memory, and legacy arrive as guides, leading Noa to finally feel in her body a new movement song.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mMAT3MNpxMHr9raW2jJkst3T8St.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Movement Song","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3763863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mayıs Rukel","original_name":"Mayıs Rukel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694486e02ee03d54d915449c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3763863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mayıs Rukel","original_name":"Mayıs Rukel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6944876445ffc6c5f3154478","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37233240","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2829,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mMAT3MNpxMHr9raW2jJkst3T8St.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
