From plainchant to the most sophisticated English 15th-c. polyphony, the music is performed by Choristers and Academical Clerks in the wonderful settings of Magdalen College and its mediaeval Chapel. The musical transcriptions from the fragments are by G. Varelli (processional chants and Gloria in excelsis) and C. Leitmeir (Credo).","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Singing the Collections: The Medieval Music Fragments of Magdalen College","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
