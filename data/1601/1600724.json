Seeking redemption, he relocates to a small, struggling theatre in Toronto, where he must stage his most ambitious work yet. Surrounded by a ragtag team of aspiring actors, overworked technicians, and Alec, an unyielding young stage manager, Lev grapples with his own demons and the pressure to succeed. As tensions rise during rehearsals, personal conflicts threaten to unravel the production, forcing Lev to confront the ghosts of his past and find a way to lead his team to opening night. A raw and intimate exploration of artistry, ego, and second chances, Requiem's Veil shines a spotlight on the human spirit's ability to persevere under the weight of failure and ambition.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Requiem For a Play","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3347682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Meer","original_name":"Christian Meer","popularity":0.1276,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Lev","credit_id":"6944ef81edfc44b8a97ab248","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34602776","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
