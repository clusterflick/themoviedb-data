Karen is one of Scotland’s most recognisable comedy performers ever, from her breakthrough on Chewin’ the Fat to her success with The Karen Dunbar Show. Her stage career spans everything from Glasgow pantomime to London’s West End, and now she is taking on stand-up comedy in her hometown.  This year has seen Karen out on the road with her brand new show, and she is bringing it back to Ayr for one more sold-out night. From delving through her experiences growing up in the 80s to hosting wild karaoke nights in Glasgow in her 20s and revisiting some of her favourite characters, this is Karen like you’ve never quite seen her before.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/zO0qqFBw0TC4zU02tvkU05wjHYP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3712,"logo_path":"/7PdJYn2l0iBViud7oqxRHO9UEIR.png","name":"BBC Scotland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karen Dunbar Live from Ayr","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1226813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Dunbar","original_name":"Karen Dunbar","popularity":0.6686,"profile_path":"/ylMJpurQsCAldTnB3B3VhXiPD83.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"69447db657d48dcef1b1ba72","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1226813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Dunbar","original_name":"Karen Dunbar","popularity":0.6686,"profile_path":"/ylMJpurQsCAldTnB3B3VhXiPD83.jpg","credit_id":"69447dcfb426a6bc67154488","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zO0qqFBw0TC4zU02tvkU05wjHYP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":235395,"name":"scottish"},{"id":276162,"name":"stand-up comedian"},{"id":363827,"name":"lgbtq"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"“Don’t gie me yer snash, Alexa!” #bbciplayer #karendunbar","key":"qgzpAl4zNZw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2025-12-18T13:02:03.000Z","id":"69447d95a6394c2ad2fb0340"}]}}}
