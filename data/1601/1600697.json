Parody slips in quietly.  Beneath the metaphors and hard-boiled dialogue lies an absurd truth: it’s all about a missing office remote. Every line, every “pressure” and “control,” is just wordplay masking something trivial.  At its core, the film is a satirical portrait of paranoia, control, and inflated self-importance—where nothing means much, yet everything feels fatal.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"SOME THINGS ARE NEVER LOST, THEY ARE JUST REFUSED & THIS WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING.
