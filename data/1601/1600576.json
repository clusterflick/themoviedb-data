Through movements that shift from asphalt to greenery, from traffic signs to luminous abstractions of a busy avenue, the film transforms everyday life into visual poetry: workers’ trousers rhyme with road signage, signs seem to dance at night, cars turn into beams of light and then into colorful brushstrokes.  In this interplay between form and rhythm, Vrruummm!!! reimagines the invisible labor that sustains the city’s circulation, the hammering at construction sites, the sweeping of asphalt, the placing and removal of traffic cones, turning these repetitive gestures into an urban choreography.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/aR7xgNvCkr67XEE9oymfxrA4O7b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":283629,"logo_path":null,"name":"DECINE / CTAv","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vrruummm!!!!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5885786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paula Dager","original_name":"Paula Dager","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69448212a6394c2ad2fb0370","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5885787,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dudu Castelões","original_name":"Dudu Castelões","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6944822b57916fb0c42fb0d6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5885788,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"André Sampaio","original_name":"André Sampaio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69448257728568dbaa8114f5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aR7xgNvCkr67XEE9oymfxrA4O7b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
