Having appeared in several Kuchar films (perhaps most notably being George’s PAGAN RHAPSODY from 1970), Jane visits George’s class at the San Francisco Art Institute to help present a screening of one of her films, Mike’s DEATH QUEST OF THE JUJU CULTS from 1976. Later, Jane and George attend an art opening at the Video Vestibule, and finding the art crowd too stifling, the two quickly adjourn to a friend’s house to relax and watch slide shows. After recovering from the late night with his brother Mike over Chinese food, George’s guests leave him so that he may once again return to the dark corners of the SFAI that is his Studio 8.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jane and Mike Visit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
