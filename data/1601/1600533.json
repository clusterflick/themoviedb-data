The film follows Jason Baldes, an Eastern Shoshone and a member of the InterTribal Buffalo Council, as he leads historic transfers of bison from Denver, Colorado to his Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, and from a Nature Conservancy Preserve in Illinois to the Menominee in Wisconsin, communities which will maintain their bison herds to supply a healthy food source and cultural touchstone to their tribal citizens for eternity. The film explores what living among the bison once again means for Native people—today and for future generations.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ahjToP1IwBnwPyUTbadXaoBTrDx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10722,"logo_path":"/mPJs7G32jMVmgUlcuobZelsjkhv.png","name":"Florentine Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10725,"logo_path":"/rLfwt5kPoXfJweOsEDgJhhBnN7Q.png","name":"WETA","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homecoming","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5885640,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Baldes","original_name":"Jason Baldes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gGiXpsUrY7eVqYstNalIiG3Rq2Z.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"69446abdefa7b8573f0fb284","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julianna Brannum","original_name":"Julianna Brannum","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69446900f2a0f67503e6ec36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331468,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julianna Brannum","original_name":"Julianna Brannum","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69446915168b5a52cae6ec59","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":204484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Burns","original_name":"Ken Burns","popularity":0.7189,"profile_path":"/rFGB5AOkjcPFSXiBq1PAnbsCxBW.jpg","credit_id":"69446926b0750093e238c0c8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5885626,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matt Leach","original_name":"Matt Leach","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69446973c5a3c6fa0eace45a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30788823","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g8HAYkoQdLp2g2GRmDPqth27FOh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ahjToP1IwBnwPyUTbadXaoBTrDx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
