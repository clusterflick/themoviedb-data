Known as the Budget Master of Tennessee, Farmer is the undisputed king of SOV Cinema, a DIY legend who’s carved a blood-soaked path through five decades of horror, trash, and straight-to-video gold.  Starting in the 1970s with a series of Super 8 films before transitioning to the “profitable” promise of videotape, Farmer found success with hypnotically gory, offbeat features—films that often hid sweet, romantic cores beneath their eye-popping VHS covers. A true original, Donald has been a writer for Fangoria, an actor, and even a reality TV star.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Donald Farmer's Wild Ride","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1885713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kasper Meltedhair","original_name":"Kasper Meltedhair","popularity":0.1675,"profile_path":"/njoWHFlFnElxH73TBXEH80BsW1M.jpg","credit_id":"69451eab854f15c2487ab356","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
