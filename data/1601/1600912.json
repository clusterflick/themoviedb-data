Trapped in patterns of choices and consequences, the protagonist slowly realizes that time doesn’t always change who we are it reveals who we’ve been becoming all along.  As the line between right and wrong blurs, the film explores how intentions decay, how denial grows, and how one can unknowingly cross from resistance into responsibility. Circles asks a simple but unsettling question: at what point do we stop fighting the cycle and become part of it?","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/lD1N6cSYeTKUwlHJIyqgzfykEKo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":283691,"logo_path":null,"name":"Still learning films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain","title":"Circles","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5887012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nour Othman","original_name":"Nour Othman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Protagonist","credit_id":"69456ac697580a80ae8ead12","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5886831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mouhamed Hesham","original_name":"Mouhamed Hesham","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/57x0ypcnueURShtu3CO9fkWuUYi.jpg","credit_id":"69456adf06cc792b2ffb0d32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5886889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Belal Gamal","original_name":"Belal Gamal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/h4hQKixpKJwc9jsR7CIVVDxkgoP.jpg","credit_id":"69456af0c0569d5cb3fb06c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5886831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mouhamed Hesham","original_name":"Mouhamed Hesham","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/57x0ypcnueURShtu3CO9fkWuUYi.jpg","credit_id":"69456b5f4e760029912fb467","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5886831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mouhamed Hesham","original_name":"Mouhamed Hesham","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/57x0ypcnueURShtu3CO9fkWuUYi.jpg","credit_id":"69456b6b0ec3833de27ab4e7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/boGAG69jcLxg6kTONDtDMsMjo19.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lD1N6cSYeTKUwlHJIyqgzfykEKo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"CIRCLES - Silent Musical Short Film (director's cut)","key":"JE35VpkX3xY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-04-25T19:00:08.000Z","id":"69456a8c0387d39733b1bd20"}]}}}
