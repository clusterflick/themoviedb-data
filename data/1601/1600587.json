Robert has spent thirty years doing what’s expected—showing up to work, keeping his thoughts to himself, and living within restraint. On his final day before retirement, a simple farewell speech becomes something far more personal, carrying the weight of decades of unspoken truth.  Soto trusts subtlety over spectacle. Small gestures, pauses, and expressions create tension, allowing the audience to feel the pressure of time closing in on a single moment. The performance feels grounded and human, making Robert instantly recognizable rather than dramatic or idealized.  Clean visuals and measured pacing mirror Robert’s inner state, letting the film’s final moments resonate naturally. At its core, And On That Day asks a timeless question: what do we lose—or gain—by staying silent for so long?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1jadJncz5mzx3rkKeKLZPiqdrkB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":283632,"logo_path":null,"name":"JHS Talent Management","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"john henry soto","title":"And On That Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1450853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Packer","original_name":"Henry Packer","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Robert","credit_id":"694486606b4ff0c5b0072387","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5885808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Greggory","original_name":"Dan Greggory","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Todd","credit_id":"6944867e244c5cf7e115447e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3728569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Henry Soto","original_name":"John Henry Soto","popularity":0.0726,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Repair guy","credit_id":"694486a3f159144b35fb0386","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":179845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Guzzone","original_name":"David Guzzone","popularity":0.1484,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Roy","credit_id":"6944922925905827412fb0de","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2215449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenna Kildosher","original_name":"Jenna Kildosher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Stacey","credit_id":"694492df94041a0192811561","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3728569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Henry Soto","original_name":"John Henry Soto","popularity":0.0726,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694486c1c0569d5cb3fb03ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3728569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Henry Soto","original_name":"John Henry Soto","popularity":0.0726,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694486dd6b4ff0c5b0072392","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5885880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Zalenski","original_name":"Lisa Zalenski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6944926d8b05685e88fb033d","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1865355,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joey Mosca","original_name":"Joey Mosca","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694493086fae3c26ea8ea9e0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5842560","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ihj6ORRjRzzUuR5ILFM6wmsMvj2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1jadJncz5mzx3rkKeKLZPiqdrkB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33490,"name":"filmmaking"},{"id":164734,"name":"nashville, tennessee"},{"id":307874,"name":"puerto rican"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Manahattan Film, TIIFF, Golden Door","release_date":"2021-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"And On That Day - Completed Highest Res","key":"T5z0XvNQArY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-06-24T02:00:06.000Z","id":"694499ae5692d556ee1544d3"}]}}}
