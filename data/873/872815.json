The exhibition is archiving a condition that may not exist decades from now. It is itself a record of the anxiety and unease around where, how and what is the physical self when one is in a social relation in cyberspace. Rafman’s work asks us to implicate ourselves in this process as both the creator and the subject, the archivist and the archived.","popularity":0.105,"poster_path":"/kVIM8kHVZ5VgjU3360XJ3uoJDxe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Annals of Time Lost","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Rafman","original_name":"Jon Rafman","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/5ouiqddcOWIAyReiu4aLwi2dSkf.jpg","credit_id":"613b7f3b6af9dd0027b3e925","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1596,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kVIM8kHVZ5VgjU3360XJ3uoJDxe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1064}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
