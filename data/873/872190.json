This documentary journey tells how, at a time when the film industry was just being consolidated, a generation of young filmmakers brought about a moment of rupture, subverting official cinema by taking the media to experiment, denounce and narrate other realities in Colombia at the end of the 1960s.","popularity":0.0432,"poster_path":"/a7Vw7o754HnDvVVLIgRH9Ps336U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2021-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El Film Justifica los Medios","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3227206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Jacobo Del Castillo","original_name":"Juan Jacobo Del Castillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61390039da9ef200446131cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15488624","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1784,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a7Vw7o754HnDvVVLIgRH9Ps336U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1244}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"FAM 2021","release_date":"2021-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
