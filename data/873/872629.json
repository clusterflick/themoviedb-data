Combining interviews with local residents, attendees at a Klan rally and counter demonstrators; historical photos; contemporary footage; scenes of a museum exhibit of the last-known original Klan robe; and a cross burning ceremony by the Klan; the video reveals Pulaski's historical and ongoing relationship to this controversial organization. We learn how Pulaski's citizens remember and reconcile the history of the Klan, how they continue to be divided about the organization's meaning and role, and how such history remains contested for Americans.","popularity":0.2307,"poster_path":"/4wgmGcL9jEzF2wel0TxNF016ZvT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Land of Milk and Honey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3228978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Donahue","original_name":"Paul Donahue","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613acf5f6af9dd0043719926","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1966479","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":795,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4wgmGcL9jEzF2wel0TxNF016ZvT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":529,"name":"ku klux klan"},{"id":12425,"name":"racism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Fort Worth Film Festival","release_date":"2001-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Ashland Independent Film Festival","release_date":"2001-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"In the Land of Milk and Honey","key":"46094283","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-07-20T14:16:19.000Z","id":"63e689f6d29bdd00a08748f5"}]}}}
