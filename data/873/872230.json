This story, told in Stanislaw Lem’s eponymous novel, was once adapted into the film Solaris by the legendary Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky. According to Deimantas Narkevičius, Tarkovsky was not as critical of the increasing impact of electronic media on relationships and on the complex nature of human memory as Lem, the original author of the story. In this video, the actor Donatas Banionis reappears in his role as Kelvin, forty years after Tarkovsky’s film was shot. Revisiting Solaris is based on the last chapter of Lem's book, which had been left out of Tarkovsky’s adaptation. In order to visualize the landscape of Solaris and expose complex specters of the past, Narkevičius combines the new footage and a series of photos from 1905 taken by the Lithuanian painter and composer Mykolojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis.","popularity":0.2153,"poster_path":"/vJm2vyvIZ0hrQlnlOqAs7qD1Lsc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revisiting Solaris","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1190206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donatas Banionis","original_name":"Донатас Банионис","popularity":0.1731,"profile_path":"/vz0TKZFu1qW5HZFhvIi0JZG9W7D.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Chris Kelvin","credit_id":"6139213c75110d00429a28ae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1697146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deimantas Narkevičius","original_name":"Deimantas Narkevičius","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/vqZOc868Qbf1QhBCbgBKOQwdx4r.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61392144d64ac20062532417","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3227320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jurga Narkevičienė","original_name":"Jurga Narkevičienė","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61392162b1f68d008c3468b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2500238,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mikalojus Čiurlionis","original_name":"Mikalojus Čiurlionis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"self","credit_id":"67ce6aabff1a840b99110d1f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1697146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deimantas Narkevičius","original_name":"Deimantas Narkevičius","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/vqZOc868Qbf1QhBCbgBKOQwdx4r.jpg","credit_id":"613920841b7294002abf5294","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8453,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stanisław Lem","original_name":"Stanisław Lem","popularity":0.2362,"profile_path":"/uPhE30C0GETl8lX2ncRGFad3ab4.jpg","credit_id":"613920a875110d00429a27bb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67826,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Johann Sebastian Bach","original_name":"Johann Sebastian Bach","popularity":0.0766,"profile_path":"/l8QFP8Pt4IQc4iQPvYbgIyNTEXX.jpg","credit_id":"6139212551c01f008666ce95","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297787,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Audrius Kemežys","original_name":"Audrius Kemežys","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61392183326c19002a7da9d0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2040873,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sigitas Motoras","original_name":"Sigitas Motoras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61392196da9ef20044616f9a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297953,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Viktoras Juzonis","original_name":"Viktoras Juzonis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613921a275110d00429a2965","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1697146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deimantas Narkevičius","original_name":"Deimantas Narkevičius","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/vqZOc868Qbf1QhBCbgBKOQwdx4r.jpg","credit_id":"613921b82cde980089e1ce22","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2500238,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mikalojus Čiurlionis","original_name":"Mikalojus Čiurlionis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ce6af4ff1a840b99110d47","department":"Crew","job":"In Memory Of"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vJm2vyvIZ0hrQlnlOqAs7qD1Lsc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
