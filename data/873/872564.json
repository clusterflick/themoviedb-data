The film is about the experience and absorption of something non-digestible. Something foreign and other, that one can not assimilate, that remains within ourselves as a foreign body and provokes rejection reactions. The short and destructive energy of a lightning is delated into a state of stasis as an overreaction. The film studies dialectical relations between black and white, the human and the non-human, light and shadow, security and insecurity, sound and silence, the known and the unknown, yourself and the other, in an audiovisual minimalist meditation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vogiWZQc8zWPQfSJWb0k1DCFQzz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Place I Will Have Left","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lena Ditte Nissen","original_name":"Lena Ditte Nissen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613a75cf6c1e040045277a16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vogiWZQc8zWPQfSJWb0k1DCFQzz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
