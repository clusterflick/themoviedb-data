Ghassan Salhab and Mohamed Soueid are embracing a sense of survival. This film is a sixth sense they nurtured in a world that has become faceless. Their film essay is a personal attempt to be two in one. Disguised as men, they walk among men who left behind their shadows.","popularity":0.0519,"poster_path":"/4aYb8qKGuLis9q8Sjtnd3n14KDK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As Far as Yearning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","title":"Aala Kad Al Shawk","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le Voyage Immobile","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1669768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed Soueid","original_name":"Mohamed Soueid","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/7CcWnPr7Wf9nHOlvOwdfStbavbs.jpg","credit_id":"623f7eea81a7fc008c9eae16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ghassan Salhab","original_name":"Ghassan Salhab","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140413056b9f70045fc9d85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3234032,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carine Doumit","original_name":"Carine Doumit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6140418c0cd32a0062bc97df","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt25221506","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4aYb8qKGuLis9q8Sjtnd3n14KDK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: MUBI (Berlin)","release_date":"2018-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
