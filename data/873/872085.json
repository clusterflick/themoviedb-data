According to Amudsen, \"if this expedition had happened at a different time, it would have caused the admiration of the whole world.\" But in Soviet times, the most productive and successful Arctic expedition of the early twentieth century was \"erased\" from history. The reason is the participation of Admiral Kolchak in its organization. Unique archival materials immerse the viewer in a gripping dramatic story.","popularity":0.0602,"poster_path":"/aZAzRHKOKlSaIHtlSj49hb4r2xq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":217447,"logo_path":null,"name":"NordWestFilm","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2015-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Geslo: The Disappeared Expedition","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"GESLO.
