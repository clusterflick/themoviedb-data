A ramshackle leaning hut with broken windows, a never-heated stove, an old cousin on the next bed. And here, in the house, there is a goat and two horses, which in fact are both a symbol of Kuzmich's life and his stove. The transmigration of souls and the new coming of Christ to Earth, unity with Nature and God - this is his Faith. \"When all borders between countries and people are erased,\" he says at the end of the film, \"then the kingdom of God will come.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man Who Put Idea In","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2045777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Pechenkin","original_name":"Pavel Pechenkin","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":"/4Bu5q6bUasDQFzMzasl7pDmh6fz.jpg","credit_id":"633f5e3cb4a543007a040993","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
