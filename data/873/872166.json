Exhausted and elated, the two women remove their helmets and warmly embrace. This traditionally European sport was brought to present day America by way of a few traveling hobbyists who fell in love with its history and athleticism. Though very much male dominated, a group of female fighters joined the fray and the concept of a knight was reborn. Steel Song follows the lives of three of these women; Shoshana Shellans, a teacher and military veteran, Bridgette Parkison, a writer with autism and essential tremors, and Julee Slovacek-Peterson, a mother and domestic abuse survivor. Together they discover not just the fight but beauty in the fight itself. STEEL SONG tells the story of everyday people who find hope, family and strength in Medieval Armored Combat.","popularity":0.0673,"poster_path":"/nLCkRP2LgvabCfDGfX3PO6Qi31C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This documentary intimately follows the lives of women who fight in an extreme and full-contact sport, Medieval Armored Combat.","title":"Steel Song","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3227153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bridgette Parkison","original_name":"Bridgette Parkison","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6138eda09369a20043ff4e5d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2242197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Cicerone","original_name":"Adrian Cicerone","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6138edd51b72940042db8597","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12232906","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"steelsongfilm","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1483,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nLCkRP2LgvabCfDGfX3PO6Qi31C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Steel Song Official Trailer","key":"576251288","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-07-17T19:49:07.000Z","id":"6138ed62b1f68d002cb400cd"}]}}}
