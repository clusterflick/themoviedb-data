They were planning on a relaxing vacation, but a river excursion ending in a popped raft leaves them stranded in the forest with no way to get home. Helplessly lost and confused, they meet Chuck - a failed forest ranger who knows less about the forest than a squirrel knows about the South Pole. They get further lost along the way and have some frightening run-ins with nature while Chuck teaches them about something that he actually does know a lot about, the spiritual armor that God gives to believers to fight off the schemes of the devil.  Join Liz, Joey, Casey, Steve and their new friend Chuck as they discover more about who God is, the salvation that He offers, and the armor that He gives to His children!","popularity":0.1474,"poster_path":"/wXz5pUmHuqnpdO23A7NSCRWC5lK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160717,"logo_path":null,"name":"SwordSmith Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Growing in the Spirit through memorizing God's Word","title":"The Armor of God: Gospel Adventure Story","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3229801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul McIntyre","original_name":"Paul McIntyre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Chuck","credit_id":"613bbbdba6ddcb0061be82e6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3229806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalie Davis","original_name":"Natalie Davis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Liz","credit_id":"613bbc04322b2b00891defa1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3229808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daisy Bailey","original_name":"Daisy Bailey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Casey","credit_id":"613bbc1be2726000423ce600","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3229809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Gilardi","original_name":"James Gilardi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Joey","credit_id":"613bbc48e8999b008d39e35f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3229811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"DJ Brown","original_name":"DJ Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Steve","credit_id":"613bbc5ac68b69002bc67d5b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3229801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul McIntyre","original_name":"Paul McIntyre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613bbcbba6ddcb002c62ed38","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3229817,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris tawney","original_name":"Chris tawney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"613bbcef322b2b0029645251","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wXz5pUmHuqnpdO23A7NSCRWC5lK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5708,"name":"gospel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
