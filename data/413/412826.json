Work was filmed in Asylum for adults in Bidružica. Without any real care or therapy, under hard sedatives and drugs, inhabitants of Asylum wasted their days without any meaningful activities – walking in circles in the yard, sitting on the benches or in the best case drinking in local pubs.","popularity":0.4894,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forbidden: Dead Harbor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","title":"Mrtva luka","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1330468,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nenad Puhovski","original_name":"Nenad Puhovski","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57bfe19b9251414b15000914","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1330468,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nenad Puhovski","original_name":"Nenad Puhovski","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57bfe1a29251414b21000888","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34169766","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1248,"name":"croatia"},{"id":11857,"name":"mental institution"},{"id":18409,"name":"mental patient"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
