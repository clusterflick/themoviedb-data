At  Beaumont Hamel the regiment was nearly wiped out, as only 110 of 780 soldiers survived the day. To commemorate its 100th anniversary, Brian McKennaâ€™s  documentary film tells the story of this epic tragedy. Using a technique that brings new meaning to reenactment, McKenna recruits descendants of soldiers who fought this battle, offering them a unique opportunity to relive the experience of their ancestors in trenches built specifically for the film.","popularity":0.495,"poster_path":"/cFGaHiO2qY0poul8Ao6oevjGUwp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4896,"logo_path":"/zCUGLv6QxlEHngDCwlVolTZu8kF.png","name":"Galafilm","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":33137,"logo_path":"/48FTUmbd9izGa98zHJWfP0PZXVk.png","name":"Morag Loves Company","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Newfoundland at Armageddon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noel Burton","original_name":"Noel Burton","popularity":0.1795,"profile_path":"/7Sj8iHUlE7QKwhE1DSnfSflktCC.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"General Haig","credit_id":"57bf2c279251414dd2003be9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Doyle","original_name":"Alan Doyle","popularity":0.1178,"profile_path":"/yMsjqPBBxXnFGcm7n9Cj4QeBTGi.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"57bf2c32c3a3685bc3003bdd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhiannon Morgan","original_name":"Rhiannon Morgan","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/ha7vFQiKepuGUDBAtzrCQlnIgFO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Coleen","credit_id":"57bf2c539251414dd2003c00","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4028902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Rex Bailey","original_name":"Michelle Rex Bailey","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"67cb8dc142c7521252f58dd6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Sprung","original_name":"Guy Sprung","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/cuEEQXOBMphQeKicbR2XDWzOsF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lieutenant General Hunter-Weston","credit_id":"57bf2c809251413d800074fb","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90715,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mark Ellam","original_name":"Mark Ellam","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63966771a1a9ba00942fd9f7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507610,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Natalie Dubois","original_name":"Natalie Dubois","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57bf2cf69251414dee003c2b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian McKenna","original_name":"Brian McKenna","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57bf2c95c3a3685bc3003c26","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1364201,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barbara Doran","original_name":"Barbara Doran","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/7HDgRgSmQoaXJlRHWCmmx8eSWBN.jpg","credit_id":"57bf2ce5c3a3682155008228","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1392552,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Susan Shanks","original_name":"Susan Shanks","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57bf2cc2c3a3685c5d003e67","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102767,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arnie Gelbart","original_name":"Arnie Gelbart","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":"/3RFHDayGaqy59rX1Dh7gHF3ajiz.jpg","credit_id":"57bf2d09c3a3682c4a009df5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5837066","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cFGaHiO2qY0poul8Ao6oevjGUwp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2504,"name":"world war i"},{"id":6178,"name":"newfoundland and labrador"},{"id":273967,"name":"war"},{"id":290079,"name":"battle of the somme"},{"id":329895,"name":"beaumont hamel"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"NEWFOUNDLAND AT ARMAGEDDON - Trailer","key":"170188997","site":"Vimeo","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-06-10T15:56:06.000Z","id":"63d2d38566ae4d008c92706a"}]}}}
