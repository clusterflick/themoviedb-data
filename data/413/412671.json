His past as a taller-than-average comedian and TV pitch-man has left him broken and unable to face his demons. That is until he finds himself both summoned for jury duty and under the constant harassment of the pizza delivery guy (Stoo Metz). With no other option, Floyd must confront his past, make friends with his enemies, and battle the great big scary unknown that is the outside world.","popularity":0.1658,"poster_path":"/crjucYNaMVo8KUCrRrR32FjdNdY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Head Space","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Struan Sutherland","original_name":"Struan Sutherland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"57befcffc3a3685bd30027c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stoo Metz","original_name":"Stoo Metz","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"57befd0ac3a3685c5d00250a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Struan Sutherland","original_name":"Struan Sutherland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Floyd","credit_id":"57befd16c3a3682c4a008360","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dale Willman","original_name":"Dale Willman","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"57befd3f9251414dee00240d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wendy Blais","original_name":"Wendy Blais","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"57befd4dc3a3685bd30027f2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Corkum","original_name":"Bill Corkum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"57befd57c3a3685c5d00253d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670075,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jeff Knox","original_name":"Jeff Knox","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57befdbf9251414dee002443","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1392423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole Steeves","original_name":"Nicole Steeves","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/ocHikcE2TrvJHe9cS9A7l4oplLs.jpg","credit_id":"57befd659251414dd20023bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670074,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lynn Matheson","original_name":"Lynn Matheson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57befd999251414dd20023d6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":99071,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kimberlee McTaggart","original_name":"Kimberlee McTaggart","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57befdb1c3a36838d900569c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Struan Sutherland","original_name":"Struan Sutherland","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57befdcc9251414dde00245d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1392423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicole Steeves","original_name":"Nicole Steeves","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/ocHikcE2TrvJHe9cS9A7l4oplLs.jpg","credit_id":"57befd80c3a36838d9005683","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":168770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingrid Veninger","original_name":"Ingrid Veninger","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":"/hSCbPql84rlIPVxPHcF8R4NnWVF.jpg","credit_id":"57befda1c3a3685bc3002327","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7913508","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/crjucYNaMVo8KUCrRrR32FjdNdY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
