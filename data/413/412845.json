These images are from a Shakespearean speech that dates from the seventeenth century. Climate change today has twisted the seasons beyond recognition, and the Bard's words describing a 'mazed world' are more relevant now than ever before. 'The Seasons Alter' is a vivid short film that uses Shakespearean poetry in the mouths of a modern family to illustrate the most pressing environmental challenge of our time.","popularity":0.4765,"poster_path":"/j4oqVFnZYhXKqenh4M4eYhmV5nw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2002-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Seasons Alter","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keira Knightley","original_name":"Keira Knightley","popularity":5.2686,"profile_path":"/bRC1B2VwV0wK3ElciFAK6QZf2wD.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Helena","credit_id":"57c01304c3a3682137002c08","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cherie Lunghi","original_name":"Cherie Lunghi","popularity":0.6967,"profile_path":"/LoIGKqUw3d58MrVsLpw22goYCK.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Titania","credit_id":"58620472c3a3681a68041452","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":172935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Owen","original_name":"Lloyd Owen","popularity":0.4321,"profile_path":"/xsBtLkxCedK1z4wfC11Q2ZBQa8Q.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Oberon","credit_id":"5862048092514115cf03ac0c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Lunn","original_name":"Roger Lunn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c0131fc3a3684d39001eb5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0399618","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j4oqVFnZYhXKqenh4M4eYhmV5nw.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4ucdAkSVtHwZMNUCYWJdumdWkmk.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
