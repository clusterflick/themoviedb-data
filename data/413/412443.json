This series reveals New Zealand’s rich and intriguing wildlife stories, from the bustling communities of penguins hiding away in giant daisy forests to the kakapo – Earth’s only species of flightless nocturnal parrots. New Zealand was also the last place to be discovered and settled by people who brought with them new animals, like merino sheep and new predators like the stoat. Finally the series meets the pioneering conservation heroes who are fighting to save some of its most endangered species.","popularity":0.5154,"poster_path":"/bzy9UGMXy8k7Z5nSts9oqPn1rWp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"},{"id":18407,"logo_path":"/cI9BOAZbURxD8hrbtbB4ncwZzox.png","name":"NDR Naturfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Zealand: Earth's Mythical Islands","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Wild New Zealand","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Neill","original_name":"Sam Neill","popularity":2.486,"profile_path":"/iIfuxalf37xUayuGyK0zG7z6WEZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"57bc3533c3a36822f20051bf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1030221,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Flowers","original_name":"Mark Flowers","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57bc33f1c3a368223700443c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276027,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Morgenstern","original_name":"Robert Morgenstern","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57bc3416c3a368226c0052da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1276020,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oliver Heuss","original_name":"Oliver Heuss","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57bc34da9251412d23004ba9","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1656692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Easton","original_name":"Nick Easton","popularity":0.0606,"profile_path":"/3k0yQNbrc5b1oq3kgxVw48xPHVf.jpg","credit_id":"64a7b84cf9253200eb6cab6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5994812","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tzrNwra6joUmKkkyuvwMzJ1RZw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eFt3cwH4FhLIV48vuoR6qOkjDwO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lttpHLNPa8UsnHuTIpVdYz1BqtK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5DZ6BPzY1jj8NEenXscmFW8Bb1X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bzy9UGMXy8k7Z5nSts9oqPn1rWp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2658,"name":"new zealand"},{"id":18165,"name":"animals"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":221355,"name":"nature documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC Two","release_date":"2016-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
