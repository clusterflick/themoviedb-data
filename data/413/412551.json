Legendary, multi-Platinum selling rockers Twisted Sister performed an explosive 90-minute concert of their biggest hits spanning their 40-year career. The show was dedicated to the honor of Twisted Sister’s iconic drummer, A.J. Pero, whose tragic, sudden death just two months prior to the filming of this event shocked the music world. The band announced that not only were all the remaining concerts being performed in 2015 dedicated to the memory of A.J. Pero, but that 2016 would mark the 40th and final year of the band’s legendary live performances. They recruited renowned drummer and friend of A.J. Pero, Mike Portnoy (The Winery Dogs, Dream Theater, Avenged Sevenfold) to take the reins, and his very first Twisted Sister appearance was captured by the “Metal Meltdown” camera crew.","popularity":0.6011,"poster_path":"/dltwdK2B8ojLlRzSJpJCXSAwuIQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27747,"logo_path":"/v1Ypqc1uH7WRk5sVQYYeaxS81Ng.png","name":"Rock Fuel Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Sound of Thunder","title":"Metal Meltdown - Featuring Twisted Sister Live at the Hard Rock Casino Las Vegas","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dee Snider","original_name":"Dee Snider","popularity":0.3803,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Vocals","credit_id":"57bd337ec3a368226c00d923","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Jay French","original_name":"Jay Jay French","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/airULoFN3z7hIxZYitzH6vpMVml.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself - Guitar","credit_id":"57bd3394925141046e00498b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie 'Fingers' Ojeda","original_name":"Eddie 'Fingers' Ojeda","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/iRjZ0sBr1FnGR9KAXwDlNPTaz0U.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself - Guitar","credit_id":"57bd33b192514168350050ce","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Mendoza","original_name":"Mark Mendoza","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/cIus2LUeLfsQUCiuttAhQtWQROK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself - Bass","credit_id":"57bd33c3c3a3683971005063","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Portnoy","original_name":"Mike Portnoy","popularity":0.2404,"profile_path":"/tGXcleyhLkBh1Dugz1g6tmJhO0y.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself - Drums","credit_id":"57bd33d79251412dba00ccb7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1111413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Lockwood","original_name":"Brian Lockwood","popularity":0.1462,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57bd3360c3a3683930004bad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6829142","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dltwdK2B8ojLlRzSJpJCXSAwuIQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":578,"name":"rock 'n' roll"},{"id":5540,"name":"heavy metal"},{"id":18001,"name":"rock band"},{"id":213805,"name":"farewell tour"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Twisted Sister Metal Meltdown, a concert to honor A.J.
