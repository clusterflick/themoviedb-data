The film deals with the richness of its collection, the recognition of international entities, and explores what its relationship to the general public was like. Nitrato also portrays the neglect with which the institution is treated, as seen in how precarious its building infrastructure is, how politicians neglected to communicate with the institution’s staff, and the aftermath of another fire in the building.","popularity":0.1978,"poster_path":"/zHLZD4HvvcvdG3vPHhb8Upp74Qa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131618,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemateca Brasileira","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nitrato","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1175418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulo Emílio Sales Gomes","original_name":"Paulo Emílio Sales Gomes","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/fbUVXlMXFtTQheOZBILV5KD86Eg.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"57bf877c92514106cf001caf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Fresnot","original_name":"Alain Fresnot","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/1vUBTVtg7WDxvgK4auDOGjv9SMi.jpg","credit_id":"57bf8788c3a3684d3d001e9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183628,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pedro Farkas","original_name":"Pedro Farkas","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/qPGEfFxnr2vobVgSvLgZ2DAMr3W.jpg","credit_id":"57bf88a492514106dc001d4b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Fresnot","original_name":"Alain Fresnot","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/1vUBTVtg7WDxvgK4auDOGjv9SMi.jpg","credit_id":"5f8614cbd4b9d90035231e54","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Fresnot","original_name":"Alain Fresnot","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/1vUBTVtg7WDxvgK4auDOGjv9SMi.jpg","credit_id":"5f8614b76082eb0036f50d40","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":931784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alain Fresnot","original_name":"Alain Fresnot","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/1vUBTVtg7WDxvgK4auDOGjv9SMi.jpg","credit_id":"5f8614c36082eb0035ec1eed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1147680,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Adilson Ruiz","original_name":"Adilson Ruiz","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa2bc260c125500372a120f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2843225,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carlos Rosset","original_name":"Carlos Rosset","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa2bc4bbcf8c900343ebf66","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2843226,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Felipe Macedo","original_name":"Felipe Macedo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa2bc647d2bc10038e77492","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12920486","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zHLZD4HvvcvdG3vPHhb8Upp74Qa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
