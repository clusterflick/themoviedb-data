Originally conceived as the composers first operetta, the work is an artful blend of opera and operetta, with a lighter mood than Puccinis other works. This live production filmed at the Deutsche Oper Berlin stars Dinara Alieva and Charles Castronovo in the lead roles. Renowned stage director Rolando Villazon sets this rendition, and the Orchestra and Chorus of the Deutsche Oper Berlin is conducted here by acclaimed Maestro Roberto Rizzi Brignoli.","popularity":0.0952,"poster_path":"/bd5ADW61SVGopxW0A0HkRCpuV5a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Delos","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Well Done Dinara Alieva!","title":"Puccini La Rondine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dinara Alieva","original_name":"Dinara Alieva","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/Ao3ABWFI2AsoXqH3SS7FOKmCUiN.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Magda","credit_id":"57b8bb8c9251413f650001eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1390118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Castronovo","original_name":"Charles Castronovo","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/kH3RqNqHPkwywWxysQLxw2Y3Vsb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ruggero","credit_id":"57b8bbd9925141423e0000ef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Hutton","original_name":"Alexandra Hutton","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lisette","credit_id":"57b8bc9792514141e300019f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvaro Zambrano","original_name":"Alvaro Zambrano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Prunier","credit_id":"57b8bd48925141417e0001db","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Rizzi Brignoli","original_name":"Roberto Rizzi Brignoli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"57b8bdc6c3a3685c15000381","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolando Villazón","original_name":"Rolando Villazón","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/x3uFOePgzuazAmt7AERncBLw9zN.jpg","credit_id":"57b8c32bc3a368611200056c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1587186,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giuseppe Adami","original_name":"Giuseppe Adami","popularity":0.1006,"profile_path":"/zBO8CLZxnFD55EyyZ6PmGruA5iE.jpg","credit_id":"57b8c426c3a36861120005f4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":958346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giacomo Puccini","original_name":"Giacomo Puccini","popularity":0.119,"profile_path":"/mAVi1Op8QWvu6QC63nb6tn1MXDm.jpg","credit_id":"66919cc0bdd9973f5de24fc1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1562,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bd5ADW61SVGopxW0A0HkRCpuV5a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1041}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"6","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
