Director Sergey Bukovsky takes the viewer on a journey of discovery as he and several Ukrainian students absorb the testimony of Ukrainian people who escaped brutal execution and those who rescued friends and neighbors during the Holocaust. A collection of men and women share the details of their experiences, and we are afforded a glimpse of modern-day Ukraine: the ethnic stereotypes that continue to exist and the manner in which Post-Soviet society is dealing with the question of how to memorialize the sites where tens of thousands of Jewish families and others were executed and thrown into mass graves.","popularity":0.6449,"poster_path":"/yEMyoDztQ1Wr4FJQQmuMkZQXmHe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1956,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plus Films","origin_country":""},{"id":80563,"logo_path":null,"name":"USC Shoah Foundation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spell Your Name","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Untitled Ukrainian Holocaust Project","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Polina Bel'skaia","original_name":"Polina Bel'skaia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"57b9dbd29251413621000675","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maryna Chaika","original_name":"Maryna Chaika","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Transciber","credit_id":"57b9dc019251413618000733","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mariia Egorycheva-Glagoleva","original_name":"Mariia Egorycheva-Glagoleva","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"57b9dc14925141361b0006a3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1433815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serhii Bukovskyi","original_name":"Сергій Буковський","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/4XfQBMFsLR7lBMof8rkPf3RzOQX.jpg","credit_id":"57b9db929251413615000689","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3883830,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roman Yelenskyi","original_name":"Roman Yelenskyi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cbbf2d9a6435008abb1a57","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Spielberg","original_name":"Steven Spielberg","popularity":2.959,"profile_path":"/tZxcg19YQ3e8fJ0pOs7hjlnmmr6.jpg","credit_id":"59414eb59251417a8301891c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1833468,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victor Pinchuk","original_name":"Victor Pinchuk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59414f1392514105990144ee","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0443684","wikidata_id":"Q4312327","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1497,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yEMyoDztQ1Wr4FJQQmuMkZQXmHe.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1271,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gJ5coHrpgeQHfFyqwRylgE2ZBJQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":848},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1368,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/g8iMAvpZbSs5TYESmTUYX2nR8lW.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":969},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1276,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/xktXgi9ynxHYLOkypgbT6pbBV6d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":851},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1373,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/xR3JBtBfKVGDitlQdUfNPKLdAfn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":973}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1739,"name":"holocaust (shoah)"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":14546,"name":"massacre"},{"id":189422,"name":"nazi occupation"},{"id":207883,"name":"1940s"},{"id":228736,"name":"german forces"},{"id":272265,"name":"ukraine"},{"id":311673,"name":"babyn yar massacre"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
