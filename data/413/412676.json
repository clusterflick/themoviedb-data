Laura Carlisle is a mid-thirties history professor who has recently begun a romantic relationship with Tom. Abigail Scott is a mid-twenties graduate student studying under Carlisle who is also Tom's oldest and closest friend from childhood. The three realize that they have interconnecting relationships when they find themselves at the funeral for Laura's former mentor. Unbeknownst to Laura, Tom and Abigail have a past that extends beyond friendship - they were once lovers. While Abigail longs for a return to that passionate relationship, Tom struggles with his continuing attraction to her, even as he falls further in love with Laura. Observing all of this at a distance is Rev. Ezekiel Hartt, a clergyman in his mid-sixties who has returned to town after a long absence with a secret that threatens to destroy them all.","popularity":0.1971,"poster_path":"/nZoalk2L09Ov4mq2F24qme9ynHj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":244824,"logo_path":null,"name":"Starhawk Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exit Thread","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilary Connell","original_name":"Hilary Connell","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/uidtv128CWBnudNvJCjlnGRvltW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Abigail Scott","credit_id":"57bf05869251414dee002802","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crystal Allen","original_name":"Crystal Allen","popularity":0.6325,"profile_path":"/gCnC9CTwho9kCphhcy5j9n5wxoY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Laura Carlisle","credit_id":"57bf05ba9251414dde00283f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1414164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Shuster","original_name":"Anthony Shuster","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Thomas Decker","credit_id":"57bf0599c3a3683873005a7a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1395428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert G.
