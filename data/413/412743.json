Astonished Island fishermen and scientists offer conflicting explanations for the bluefin’s puzzling behaviour. One thing is certain: this great resurgence of gigantic tuna flies in the face of scientific assessments claiming that endangered stocks are down by 90 percent.","popularity":0.0765,"poster_path":"/7mqDJRpJGiPfn7wMXxYGWHL6gI0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bluefin","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1476509,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul
