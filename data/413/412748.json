For almost 70 years the RCI shortwave towers broadcast around the world. Due to budget cuts, the site was decommissioned in 2012 and dismantled in 2014. Examining themes of identity and memory, the film captures images of the towers over four seasons in various weather conditions, accompanied by the voices of residents and technicians narrating accounts of hearing radio broadcasts emanate from their household appliances.","popularity":0.4407,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":87172,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magnetic Mountain Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about radio waves, relationships, landscape, and loss.","title":"Spectres of Shortwave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Ombres Des Ondes Courtes","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1670236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amanda Dawn Christie","original_name":"Amanda Dawn Christie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57bf4d7ec3a3684d3d0005fe","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1670236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amanda Dawn Christie","original_name":"Amanda Dawn Christie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57bf4d90c3a3684d340004e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1670236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amanda Dawn Christie","original_name":"Amanda Dawn Christie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57bf4d7292514106d200057c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1670236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amanda Dawn Christie","original_name":"Amanda Dawn Christie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57bf4da0c3a3684d25000601","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767073,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno Bélanger","original_name":"Bruno Bélanger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b57fd3c3a3685edf00a447","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767069,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dan Grady","original_name":"Dan Grady","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b57f149251410ada00ad46","department":"Camera","job":"Key Grip"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1767074,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Sylvain Cossette","original_name":"Sylvain Cossette","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b58002c3a3685f2c00a9a8","department":"Editing","job":"Color Timer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767072,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ryan Hillier","original_name":"Ryan Hillier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b57facc3a3685ef700af35","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1670236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amanda Dawn Christie","original_name":"Amanda Dawn Christie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b57fb9c3a3685eb100ac77","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767071,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nathan Jones","original_name":"Nathan Jones","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b57f9dc3a3685edf00a3fd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767070,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rob Tough","original_name":"Rob Tough","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b57f8cc3a3685f2c00a8f7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1670236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amanda Dawn Christie","original_name":"Amanda Dawn Christie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b57fe09251410a8000b93d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1670236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amanda Dawn Christie","original_name":"Amanda Dawn Christie","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58b58024c3a3685f0200a817","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2811582","wikidata_id":"Q27038312","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2135,"name":"radio"},{"id":175985,"name":"landscape"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
