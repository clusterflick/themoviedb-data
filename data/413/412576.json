The film featured four actors: two women and two men, one of them Godard. According to Rivette, “It ran 40 minutes and nothing happens. It’s just four people sitting around a table, looking at each other. After ten minutes, people started to leave, and at the end, the only ones who stayed were Jean-Luc and a girl.” (Richard Brody)","popularity":0.0561,"poster_path":"/p6rdyrvDqpx9VZP1iuwgyAMjLAM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1950-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Quadrille","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Quadrille","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Luc Godard","original_name":"Jean-Luc Godard","popularity":1.0955,"profile_path":"/zP5EDY5MstfkdBmPXNCj8Y6v5KR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57bd8b0cc3a3684f63000094","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1928856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne-Marie Cazalis","original_name":"Anne-Marie Cazalis","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":"/ieP7Xfic7d0V2eLXnbKXoeBQZMi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6211ba1aa24232006b0105c5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liliane Litvin","original_name":"Liliane Litvin","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6211ba2844a4240046c9a936","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3434806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"François Nithart","original_name":"François Nithart","popularity":0.0626,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6211ba2c3f4833001c949b35","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Rivette","original_name":"Jacques Rivette","popularity":0.3005,"profile_path":"/rJVyIQcU8CcCkWOuThhY1g5SrSh.jpg","credit_id":"57bd8af29251410ed00172a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0042866","wikidata_id":"Q11349133","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/p6rdyrvDqpx9VZP1iuwgyAMjLAM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1950-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
