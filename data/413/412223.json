The film is about a certain stage in the development of a young artist confronting the real world in terms of her own idealistic notions of what art is supposed to do. You never see her. She is the camera’s eye and when someone says to the camera “My darling be careful”, it could be addressing her or you the spectator. The subjective camera set-up challenges your position as an impartial observer. - BM","popularity":0.1538,"poster_path":"/9xEAbtwOaXy3qTpzhM4n8fiUCTu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cold Eye (My Darling, Be Careful)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1334317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Barth","original_name":"James Barth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"57b9ae129251415b4b001430","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Deem","original_name":"George Deem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"57b9ae28c3a3684fe30014eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Ginsberg","original_name":"Kim Ginsberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"57b9ae2f9251415b4b001445","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maggie Grynastyl","original_name":"Maggie Grynastyl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"57b9ae379251413f65006c46","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saskia Noordhoek-Hegt","original_name":"Saskia Noordhoek-Hegt","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"57b9ae3ec3a3682f910085b6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1276203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valda Setterfield","original_name":"Valda Setterfield","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"57b9ae4592514141e3006d3c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1202196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ela Troyano","original_name":"Ela Troyano","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/djJPoTvOzMbsU5p9JZMwkPYTEJg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"57b9ae4dc3a3682f910085bd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3913435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Power Boothe","original_name":"Power Boothe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"63e55518c2ff3d008e586596","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1017426,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Babette Mangolte","original_name":"Babette Mangolte","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":"/lW1aBFQVh4GNXtqZPFL8QTIlJQm.jpg","credit_id":"57b9ae73925141299f0023dc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1017426,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Babette Mangolte","original_name":"Babette Mangolte","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":"/lW1aBFQVh4GNXtqZPFL8QTIlJQm.jpg","credit_id":"57b9ae5ec3a3682f910085c7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1017426,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Babette Mangolte","original_name":"Babette Mangolte","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":"/lW1aBFQVh4GNXtqZPFL8QTIlJQm.jpg","credit_id":"57b9ae64925141299f0023d5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1334317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Barth","original_name":"James Barth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b9ae7e9251413f65006c67","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1017426,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Babette Mangolte","original_name":"Babette Mangolte","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":"/lW1aBFQVh4GNXtqZPFL8QTIlJQm.jpg","credit_id":"57b9ae6dc3a3680e28002606","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1017426,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Babette Mangolte","original_name":"Babette Mangolte","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":"/lW1aBFQVh4GNXtqZPFL8QTIlJQm.jpg","credit_id":"57b9ae58c3a3684fa7001787","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0319206","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9xEAbtwOaXy3qTpzhM4n8fiUCTu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":930}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
