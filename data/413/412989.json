Five decades later, Martin and his girls live very separate lives. Martin remained true to his counter-culture beliefs and today, lives \"in community,\" sharing his rambling Montreal, Mile End apartment with young roommates who dig his alternative vibe. For Martin, being a hippy wasn't a phase, it's a way of life. His daughters, both now living in Philadelphia, decided on less eccentric existences. Martin and his girls give honest accounts of their lives together and why their paths and dreams ran so far apart. This is a film about choices and how they impact those we love.","popularity":0.0882,"poster_path":"/2lTxU9R0MY4wfoKxaU2wpWRDuqI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Histoire Hippie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-André Fourestié","original_name":"Jean-André Fourestié","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c10b8bc3a3687a3c002cbf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1670824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-André Fourestié","original_name":"Jean-André Fourestié","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f85e3dc3a368602e01105e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1575139,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nathalie Barton","original_name":"Nathalie Barton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f85f5ac3a36860af010c70","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914989,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ian Oliveri","original_name":"Ian Oliveri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59f85e6ec3a36860af010b28","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1881780,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hervé Baillargeon","original_name":"Hervé Baillargeon","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6c532e0e4fc81ce0d9224c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5989304","wikidata_id":"Q27039201","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1762,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2lTxU9R0MY4wfoKxaU2wpWRDuqI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1175}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
