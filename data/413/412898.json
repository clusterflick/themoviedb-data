Rainer had become world-famous for his abstract art and, in particular, for his over-layering of photographs and overpainting of his own and other artists’ works. But who painted over the “overpainter”? Speculation rages: Did he attack his works himself? A year later, an unsigned letter surfaces claiming responsibility for the act directed against Rainer – and modern art in general – and accusing the artist of being complicit with “destructive modernism.” At the same time, Austria is shaken by a series of mail bombs by the Bajuwarian Liberation Army, in response to the supposed threat to Austria’s “German identity.” Are there connections between the overpainting event and the mail bombs? Or is this all just a game? A dream? Or perhaps a hallucination?","popularity":0.3521,"poster_path":"/tScmcTTUsbPju6v7gTcosXQrgcX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lutz Dammbeck Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1998-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Master Game","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"621de34a8a88b2001c6a790a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38196,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Thomas Plenert","original_name":"Thomas Plenert","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621de3bd9f1be7001b1166fa","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","credit_id":"621de378f12cf4001b7d3c7c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39540,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"J.U.
