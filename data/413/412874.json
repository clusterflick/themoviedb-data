Not only because of the wide range of artistic disciplines, but also because of the timespan, since the mid 1960s to the present day, that has been saturated by hundreds of records, thousands of concerts, exhibitions, interviews, videos, spoken word performances, collages, sculptures, philosophy, cultural engineering, occultism and radical transgender concepts. A couple of descriptions are still valid after these 50 years of active creativity and provocation. P-Orridge is a romantic existentialist and a cultural engineer. Everything is both work as such and seed for cultural and behavioural change.","popularity":0.2175,"poster_path":"/aEcdKxz2c2USQDI3xTBX0Yl44kX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80736,"logo_path":null,"name":"TRAPART","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2016-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Change Itself – An Art Apart: Genesis Breyer P-Orridge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":550261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Genesis P-Orridge","original_name":"Genesis P-Orridge","popularity":0.1393,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Themself","credit_id":"57c03a30c3a3684d39002ecf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Abrahamsson","original_name":"Carl Abrahamsson","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b1be2696386404701d90ad","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carl Abrahamsson","original_name":"Carl Abrahamsson","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c03a0992514149eb000355","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5755808","wikidata_id":"Q27045123","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aEcdKxz2c2USQDI3xTBX0Yl44kX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4048,"name":"musician"},{"id":5933,"name":"poet"},{"id":293118,"name":"experimental music"},{"id":338022,"name":"genesis breyer p-orridge"},{"id":338024,"name":"performance artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
