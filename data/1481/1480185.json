Filmed during the 2.5 month recording session with Producer Dave Otero, the film focuses on each individual instrument's recording process with interviews from each member contemplating the work once the album was wrapped up. All the stress, frustration, comradery, laughter, intensity and passion for the work is on display here and its a must-watch for any Cattle fan of every era.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":262154,"logo_path":null,"name":"NJV Media","origin_country":""},{"id":262155,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cattle Decapitation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The official studio documentary of the making of 2023's \"TERRASITE\".","title":"From This Flesh - A Cattle Decapitation Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5434667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"NJ VanVidler","original_name":"NJ VanVidler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68229a60f2fba6e6698643f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5434667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"NJ VanVidler","original_name":"NJ VanVidler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68229a9ad332be6464a1652d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5434667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"NJ VanVidler","original_name":"NJ VanVidler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68229aad34194d40d04b495f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5434667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"NJ VanVidler","original_name":"NJ VanVidler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68229ac4ba5e98bbaf7394ad","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Straight to YouTube","release_date":"2025-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
