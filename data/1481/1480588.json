The film derives inspiration from Etel Adnan’s ‘Le Livre de la Mer,’ as we meditate on the Mediterranean Sea and our relationship to it. Our choice of location emerges from our shared homeland of Egypt and our inspiration from the work of Sappho, Constantine Cavafy, and Etel Adnan. Utilising their mythos and works, Oracle is crafted to map a beginning in our artistic practice by exploring the Mediterranean Sea and our relationships to it. We invite the audience to witness our homes on the Eastern Mediterranean, Palestine and Egypt, and the relationships we share with neighbouring lands.","popularity":0.0857,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oracle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
