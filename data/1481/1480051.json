After giving up her dreams to care for her father after a tragic accident, Esme, seven years later, is offered a dog-sitting job in Greenwich Village by a mysterious stranger, giving her access to all of her long-buried hopes and dreams, as well as to an epic collection of designer shoes. Esme jumps at a second chance to step into the future she’s sure was meant to be hers. As she retraces her steps, one pair of borrowed shoes at a time, making new friends and reconnecting with her old love, Esme tries on versions of herself she didn’t know existed. But the hazy August days and warm summer nights pass too quickly, and Esme must decide how much of the life she imagined still fits, and what — and who—is on the road ahead of her.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":262135,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mrs. Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Rumored","tagline":"","title":"A Shoe Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Rinna","original_name":"Lisa Rinna","popularity":3.2614,"profile_path":"/e1reRbSRgIEUDp56LwyEgID2sfc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68225669aeac0742467e7e9b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5434256,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jane L.
