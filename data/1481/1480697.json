Two vertical bars move back and forth across the width of half the frame. Through these apertures a girl is seen walking back and forth, in a similar manner to the bars. The movement of each of the bars is fairly constant whilst that of the figure is erratic. Each section of the film, i.e. right and left hand images, was shot entirely at random - the matte being moved by hand and the figure's movement being decided by herself. DUET was preceded by two earlier forms; both of which were abandoned. The first (Summer 1974) used a single image, the camera panning constantly between two points whilst the figure moved at random within, and without the frame. In the second version the camera described a circle, the figure moving along the circumference of circles at varying radii.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Duet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1861745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roger Hewins","original_name":"Roger Hewins","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6823bfaf73f573f98b333d80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
