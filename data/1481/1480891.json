Like a modern day Maude from Harold and Maude, Babs moves through life at breakneck speed. She spars with her ex over her 5-year plan for relationships, admitting to a reputation for always having her vibrator. She lap-dances at a party celebrating the 41st anniversary of her 39th birthday, threatening to kick anyone who says “80” out the door. A trip to the AIDS memorial grove on the heels of aquacise class at the Jewish Community Center sparks a glorious rumination on a possible afterlife.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thanks, Babs!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
