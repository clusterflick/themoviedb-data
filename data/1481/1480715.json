A woman dances, via these still images, to music by Stockhausen, her image filling the screen, her performance evoked through the use of jump-cuts. Breaking in on this is an animated sequence which describes women and childbirth. This experimental film eventually moves into live action, showing the dancer’s movements in slow motion and freeze frames.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mantra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1753747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeanette Iljon","original_name":"Jeanette Iljon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6823cc332186d5ae7ead9bab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
