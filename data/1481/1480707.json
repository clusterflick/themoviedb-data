These graves are the partially submerged remains of mothballed tugboats, ferries and other vessels. Arthur Kill is the name of the waterway separating New Jersey from Staten Island. The graveyard has been described as an 'accidental maritime museum,' but you won't find it on any tourism map. This 32-minute documentary offers its audience a rare tour of the boneyard, while focusing on its history and eerie aesthetic appeal.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/xR8yiR6NQkmFcF32P0wU1Dc5pNW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Graves of Arthur Kill","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5436793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Will van Dorp","original_name":"Will van Dorp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6823c621299d2db7ca333db1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3037638","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xR8yiR6NQkmFcF32P0wU1Dc5pNW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Graves of Arthur Kill.
