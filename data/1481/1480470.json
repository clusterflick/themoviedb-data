Deserted tables, a slow-moving staff. The waiter leans at the window, unhurriedly cleaning his fingernails. The cook and the waitress bide their time patiently. Gestures of waiting. Communication no longer seems necessary, as the well-coordinated routine functions smoothly without it. Only the trainÂ´s clattering on the rails is audible - an monotonous and soothing sound. This monotony is echoed in the forced lethargy of the restaurant-car staff. It seems to be a ghost train, a train without passengers. Then the tableau comes alive as if wakened by an inaudible signal. The three figures begin to sweep and wipe: The car must be cleaned thoroughly before it reaches the terminus.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/mRFojygv3SmuI8qvLlL1HbrmLKJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95813,"logo_path":null,"name":"BKA Kunst","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5435865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingeburg Wurzer","original_name":"Ingeburg Wurzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Waitress","credit_id":"68235aa2555633850ead98f7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5435866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Zitko","original_name":"Otto Zitko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Waiter","credit_id":"68235ab68754011eb24b4a6f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josef Dabernig","original_name":"Josef Dabernig","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Cook","credit_id":"68235add41cfdac3c8a166ea","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josef Dabernig","original_name":"Josef Dabernig","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68235aeeafc73518c47399fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josef Dabernig","original_name":"Josef Dabernig","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68235b1065d0c8f3be2d2091","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1112227,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christian Giesser","original_name":"Christian Giesser","popularity":0.1198,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68235b1d7d5a6bf67d7e81e2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josef Dabernig","original_name":"Josef Dabernig","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68235b2e8a66bfded07e832d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josef Dabernig","original_name":"Josef Dabernig","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68235b45e5b34d36067e820e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0307652","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1384,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mRFojygv3SmuI8qvLlL1HbrmLKJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":923}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
