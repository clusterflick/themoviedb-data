Murrow's CBS \"See it Now\" series and with Murrow as the commentator, was produced for theaters and was not a television program...and WAS NOT part of the Murrow television series. This \"Iron Curtain/Atomic Age\" preparedness film is a plea for needed civilian volunteers to act as aircraft spotters all around the United States. An air attack on New York City is simulated by B-29 bombers flying from London, England, and they fly practically undetected to their target area due to a shortage of civilian-volunteers at spotting points around the country. Murrow's dooms-day narration didn't calm the nerves of the theatre-audiences that saw this, either.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Plane, One Bomb","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1225821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward R.
