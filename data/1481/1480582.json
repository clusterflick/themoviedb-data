In this city, space – both size and location – directly correlates with costs, and discussions about final wishes are necessary but frequently overlooked and neglected. 414 unearths the cultural and societal hesitations surrounding discussions about funeral arrangements, types of burial and final resting places. The film invites viewers into contemplative conversations about the philosophical and practical wishes of the dead – past, present, and future.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"414","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
