The first response on the same rhythms and themes as television. Primordial consumer technology as a creative basis for a video work on the border between painting and animation. United with the video hiss of AMIGA pixels, with the overflow of its other color frequencies, the hold of the PAL, on the border of VHS. A narrative construction that tells in a non-linear way. Since 1995 a prelude to contemporary visuals.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/p8X8DmSL2ZbitKWLkSxMb7u1bWQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":240011,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amiga Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A tribute to the world of television","title":"A tribute to the world of television","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3443062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saul Saguatti","original_name":"Saul Saguatti","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68238c3d90599652aead9b7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p8X8DmSL2ZbitKWLkSxMb7u1bWQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
