But as career and family was settling in, an emptiness overtook him, eventually leading him back to the country he barely remembered but ran deep in his blood. There, he connected with a team of courageous nuns and dedicated volunteers. Together, they built a house for an impoverished family. Then another. Soon there were hundreds. Educational programs would follow. And a ripple effect that would change the lives of thousands.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/iryup148EPmXokCMvDShvBlWZEa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United
