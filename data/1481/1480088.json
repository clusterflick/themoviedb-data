The heroine of the three-volume, voluminous novel is the bewitchingly beautiful girl from the mountains, Nuca. Under the Cathedral, Urszun lives in a strange, round wooden house with his father, the speechless Tóderik. He knows no other law than the law of forests and mountains, nor does he learn goodness from God or in its shadow, but from nature. Her life is not easy, as her father is taken away by the gendarmes, so the ten-year-old girl grows up relying on herself and people's compassion.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":262138,"logo_path":null,"name":"EP-Overseas Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Witch of Funtinel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1433100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Nádasdi","original_name":"Peter Nádasdi","popularity":0.4053,"profile_path":"/wL5CoD0PwI77xk2boAHIEfbg5wN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tóder","credit_id":"6822644aa11532efe87e807d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5434395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emöke Katalin Szabadi","original_name":"Emöke Katalin Szabadi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Nuca","credit_id":"682264598529c58a5e6ee5d3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1795335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Attila Bocsárszky","original_name":"Attila Bocsárszky","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":"/eTxltQqDIdkK8oVf65eE2V5KZT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Farkas Dumitru","credit_id":"6822646b8a0d663e9f73953e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5434396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Péter Havasi Jr.","original_name":"Péter Havasi Jr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Garabonciás Gyerkó","credit_id":"6822647b2a93e270ba73944a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3813223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Szilárd Petrik","original_name":"Szilárd Petrik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Kirilla","credit_id":"68226490ba5e98bbaf739408","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5434397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"László Székely-Benczédi","original_name":"László Székely-Benczédi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Éltetö Gáspár","credit_id":"6822649f551b4c1d89739571","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5434399,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Albert Wass","original_name":"Albert Wass","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682264b0a9bce0e586739417","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3737512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mário Lago","original_name":"Mário Lago","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682264b9ba5e98bbaf73940c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3541314,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Miron Manega","original_name":"Miron Manega","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682264c5e64080c0657e7f37","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2018332,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kevin Blair","original_name":"Kevin Blair","popularity":0.0912,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682264cd981f6258c26ee742","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2516032,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Csaba László Eröss","original_name":"Csaba László Eröss","popularity":0.5374,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682264d7371aad4c3f2d1e82","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3541298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magdolna Cecília Eröss","original_name":"Magdolna Cecília Eröss","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682264e1c9d49e83bca1678d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5434403,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Béla Péter Mónus","original_name":"Béla Péter Mónus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"682264f00834f8f64c2d1b58","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3423418","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"},{"id":3205,"name":"fairy tale"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
