A special emphasis is placed on their status as mothers and on the role of nurseries and socialist kindergartens not only in making their lives easier, but also in giving them the time they need to build a career. Another concern of the filmmaker, starting from the concrete case of one of the protagonists, is to highlight the differences between the happy present and the not-too-distant past in which someone with her social status should have dedicated herself exclusively to raising children, in hygienic and extremely difficult lives.","popularity":0.1705,"poster_path":"/m9G7lWOfiqQM5LRH2XlaCvtrho5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155806,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studioul \"Alexandru Sahia\"","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1958-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women of Today","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2128918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ioana Drăgan","original_name":"Ioana Drăgan","popularity":0.3237,"profile_path":"/1FjYlsNYXIGvNgiv68KQ0gkroQO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"658d8750fdfc9f6127e01824","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4452083,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dumitru Popescu","original_name":"Dumitru Popescu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658d872f2afb255f700cc287","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4451238,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eugenia Gruici","original_name":"Eugenia Gruici","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658d873ffdfc9f5fa2e0653a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2404422,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Constantin Ionescu-Tonciu","original_name":"Constantin Ionescu-Tonciu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658d86c8fe5c91244d109b32","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":233717,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Márta Mészáros","original_name":"Márta Mészáros","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":"/p0fZlJMGYRjgD5lYpcPsLhp5bz9.jpg","credit_id":"658d867e1b1f3c5937fcf30c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1738721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugen Popescu","original_name":"Eugen Popescu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658d86e28ed03f5eeb93d2ec","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":2118,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m9G7lWOfiqQM5LRH2XlaCvtrho5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1422}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3023,"name":"eastern europe"},{"id":158987,"name":"post war"},{"id":179882,"name":"romania"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":224427,"name":"soviet realism"},{"id":235671,"name":"gender equality"},{"id":298721,"name":"women"},{"id":299282,"name":"nonfiction"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ro","note":"","release_date":"1958-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
