The film follows a protagonist as they traverse a desolate landscape, reflecting on the transient nature of life and the inevitability of death. Through a series of dreamlike sequences, the audience is presented with a powerful meditation on the idea of eternity, and how it can be seen in the rise and fall of empires. The film culminates in a powerful scene of the protagonist standing atop a hill, looking out at the ruins of the Soviet empire, and contemplating the eternal cycle of life and death.","popularity":0.5234,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":216787,"logo_path":null,"name":"arTevi Films Ltd.
