The film interrogates our familyâ€™s experiences in relation to the displacement and oppression undergone by Aboriginal people in Australia and considers the ramifications of being a displaced person settled on Indigenous (stolen) land. The film is situated between Art and Documentation as a relation between traumatic events and the recording of a truth as means for preventing the distortion and erasing of facts by colonial powers.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cleaning In Progress","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
