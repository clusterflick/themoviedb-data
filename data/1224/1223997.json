Running mostly along the course of the river itself, this documentary puts the viewer in the driver's seat, showing the almost pristine landscapes of the upper Douro, through a view that until today has been exclusive to the railwaymen who travel the 171.5 kilometers of the route between São Bento station (Porto) and Pocinho (Vila Nova de Foz Côa). Along the way, we cross three World Heritage Sites: the Historic Centre of Porto, the Alto Douro Wine Region and the Côa Valley Rupestrian Art Sites.","popularity":0.0726,"poster_path":"/8GG5gkiePa7NeXIyEv2xLIxk7vX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":217067,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sobre Carris","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":219,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Douro Line - Heritage on Rails","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1931495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luís Sobreiro","original_name":"Luís Sobreiro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658f18431f748b6f2e9845f3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1931495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luís Sobreiro","original_name":"Luís Sobreiro","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658f18350d2f535e25d3baea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30491126","wikidata_id":"Q124045111","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2691,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/8GG5gkiePa7NeXIyEv2xLIxk7vX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1794}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
