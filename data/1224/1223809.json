This work repeats fragmented, distorted, and faded elements over and over again, while drifting towards abstract degradations and looped simulations, circling back on itself endlessly until exhaustion, insisting on saying what it already said in the first instance (much like this very sentence). Words, sounds, and textures merge and disintegrate into noise without an apparent pattern but very present nonetheless. The subject stretches, compresses, and expands, once again showing that the possibilities of technological replication can generate subpar prints, leaving a bad impression both on paper and in our minds.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Compre(hen)ssion of Artifacts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4453141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damián Anache","original_name":"Damián Anache","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658e4953d18fb90156ad1ed4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
