In a way, it can be defined as a historical chronicle, following the historical facts in their order and inter-relationship, sticking to the documentary style of story-telling and image. The characters are named after real people or after realistic prototypes. In choosing this highly conflicting moment of history as the object of artistic exploration, the film's authors were undoubtedly attracted by its stark heroism and tragedy, as well as by the opportunity to convey a contemporary moral message.\"  - Grigor Chernev.
