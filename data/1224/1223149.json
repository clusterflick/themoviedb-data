Amalia reaches out to Sofia for support—she was raped by her coach from the ages of 11 to 13—leading them on a path toward justice. In a milestone trial, Amalia faces grueling courtroom proceedings, intense victim-blaming, and attempts to discredit her. Sofia stands firmly by her side, providing support and crucial testimony. The statute of limitations on her case has expired, preventing her from having her day in court.","popularity":0.1584,"poster_path":"/weZ2pH1SFdJPWLXlLX5SE2dtYYe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tack","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4600744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia Bekatorou","original_name":"Sofia Bekatorou","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/94Qqi3bDgGQwnLDsyrdLeDbo9Ms.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"65f86b26ae3843017d4ca6c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4600745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amalia Proveleggiou","original_name":"Amalia Proveleggiou","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"65f86b47a6fdaa017d6f95b1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3238839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vania Barbara Turner","original_name":"Vania Barbara Turner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/36NRJy8p46JzHn0wGB2EXiapmJI.jpg","credit_id":"658c544fb33903224fe84543","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3238839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vania Barbara Turner","original_name":"Vania Barbara Turner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/36NRJy8p46JzHn0wGB2EXiapmJI.jpg","credit_id":"676ff74e2c9097b266618576","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3238839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vania Barbara Turner","original_name":"Vania Barbara Turner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/36NRJy8p46JzHn0wGB2EXiapmJI.jpg","credit_id":"676ff779d6d10ecc8c12e060","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3238839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vania Barbara Turner","original_name":"Vania Barbara Turner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/36NRJy8p46JzHn0wGB2EXiapmJI.jpg","credit_id":"676ff7c56cc4caf8fb928c79","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Design Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31248601","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ugwAztUv1wC8FqrTS2RvOHGSRsj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hhTkWRB4gI2Iy98bDrw3sh5UCg6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/weZ2pH1SFdJPWLXlLX5SE2dtYYe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"Thessaloniki International Documentary Festival ","release_date":"2024-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Film Festival for Women's Rights","release_date":"2024-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"6+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Women Make Waves International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Molodist Kyiv International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
