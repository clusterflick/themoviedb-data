Live images accessible 24/24. My family members appear in front of one of the cameras. Then go away, disappearing from the frame. I'm trying to find them with other cameras. The seasons change and transform the city. I continue to wander there, obsessed with the idea of seeing them again. Their distant voices regularly give me news on the phone. I am hanging from a lamppost, from a Soviet building, from a tree. And I stay there, watching the others.
