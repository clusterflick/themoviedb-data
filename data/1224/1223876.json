Its title and narration are taken from a piece written by Manuel Zimbro, in which he muses on what it is that prevents man from being able to fly, and what impact this limitation has on the natural world. The images collated in this film trace the devastation left by the fires of 2017 – the worst year on record in terms of damage to Portugal's forests.
