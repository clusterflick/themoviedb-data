The job will soon be taken over by AI! To get back at the beauty guru, Adam kidnaps his wife and famous brand face Evelyn. Unfortunately, it doesn't occur to Rob to pay a ransom for her. On the contrary: the vain star surgeon wants to rejuvenate his relationship with 29-year-old beauty model Lene anyway and is even grateful to the kidnapper! When Evelyn makes it clear to Adam that without her help he will neither get the money he craves nor get out of the affair in one piece, the two of them join forces. They come up with a brazen plan to empty Rob's offshore accounts.","popularity":0.5875,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":217031,"logo_path":null,"name":"307
