She finds solace around animals and visits her favorite cat café, Munch the Night Away three times a week. Every day that she spends there, she tries to build up the courage to talk to others, but nobody piques her interest. One day, a girl named Mai catches Lydia's eye and she's instantly, but shyly, smitten. Lydia tries to get her attention to talk to her but since she’s unable to speak when she’s nervous, the situation immediately becomes much harder than it initially seemed.","popularity":0.0842,"poster_path":"/cgN7c0BCdCwvrSm1VKOqBvDTWQV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Café au Fate","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4453960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mika Ervin","original_name":"Mika Ervin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658f0a2e7a4ee779c383e62b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4453960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mika Ervin","original_name":"Mika Ervin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658f0a23d363e55283099b39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cgN7c0BCdCwvrSm1VKOqBvDTWQV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
