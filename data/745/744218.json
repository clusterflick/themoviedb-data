Growing up in the projects, he joined a gang and was incarcerated. He was deported back to Cambodia--a country he had never been to. In Phnom Penh, word spread that KK was a break dancer. Kids would show up at his door asking him to teach them. He saw they were sleeping on the street, not going to school, and getting into drugs--a bad path he knew. He started teaching them and his friend Shhort, who had a similar story as KK, taught English. Now, Tiny Toones teaches 100 kids dance and other subjects each day. Most importantly, KK turned his life around to give kids like him an education and a chance.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":"/pvPxaxh2aluyDMG0clvPisXxPcj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","name":"Cambodia"}],"release_date":"2020-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Name Crew: Tiny Toones","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tuy \"KK\" Sobil","original_name":"Tuy \"KK\" Sobil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f643e82d236e600347cee8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chhoeung \"Shhort\" Reuth","original_name":"Chhoeung \"Shhort\" Reuth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f643e8c069f0e0036b00162","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sorn \"Slick\" Sochea","original_name":"Sorn \"Slick\" Sochea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f643e96dd926a003942adfd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saram \"Jacky\" Sara","original_name":"Saram \"Jacky\" Sara","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f643ea187f3f2003a84d9c0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arestia Rosenberg","original_name":"Arestia Rosenberg","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f643eb084448e0037682a9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12621794","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pvPxaxh2aluyDMG0clvPisXxPcj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fPNQmuK2s5zarcZcHidljqC9BWx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DC Shorts film festival","release_date":"2020-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cambodia Town Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
