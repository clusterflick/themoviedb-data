For years, a declining population and treacherous waters had made life there risky. In 1953, the Irish government evacuated the 22 remaining residents of An Blascaod Mór to the nearby village of Dún Chaoin. This documentary examines aspects of the island's history and literary legacy, and features interviews with former islanders.","popularity":0.697,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÉ","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1985-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Island: A Portrait of the Blasket Islands","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kieron Moore","original_name":"Kieron Moore","popularity":0.3559,"profile_path":"/n2LJ0Hfvea7o3lhQ5A7mP3SZiNU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself / Narrator","credit_id":"5f65495c5a78840034ba76d7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2784197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Muiris Mac Conghail","original_name":"Muiris Mac Conghail","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f65499208cf870037454f62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2784197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Muiris Mac Conghail","original_name":"Muiris Mac Conghail","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6549a01684f7003951e9fb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2784200,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Myles Merriman","original_name":"Myles Merriman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6549b2dd926a003a402c7f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":31192,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gerard Victory","original_name":"Gerard Victory","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f654a02ce5d820034a090b7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1597373,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Breffni Byrne","original_name":"Breffni Byrne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f654a21ce5d820036abe7e6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2784205,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eamon Timoney","original_name":"Eamon Timoney","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f654a6ace5d820036abe93a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2784206,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Liam McDonagh","original_name":"Liam McDonagh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f654aa3945c200037df98c9","department":"Lighting","job":"Electrician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2323707,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Deborah Spillane","original_name":"Deborah Spillane","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f654ab757530e0039a7c3ab","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1672375,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Daithí Connaughton","original_name":"Daithí Connaughton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f654acfaf3da6003728f0b0","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2784209,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Maura Lee","original_name":"Maura Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f654b186a222700378815ae","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2227,"name":"evacuation"},{"id":14985,"name":"ireland"},{"id":155746,"name":"deserted island"},{"id":220234,"name":"island life"},{"id":220235,"name":"remote village"},{"id":232529,"name":"irish life"},{"id":253687,"name":"evacuee community"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"RTÉ One","release_date":"1985-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
