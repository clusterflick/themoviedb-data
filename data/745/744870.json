A couple creates their IDs with their faces before plastic surgery and develop their love for each other. On the anniversary of the 100th day of their first meeting through the app, the couple are about to make love, but the app is down. Love Virtually is a rom-com about a couple searching for true love in a world where virtual reality is the norm by mixing the real world and virtual reality. Both in the real world and virtual reality, they meet each other before and after cosmetic surgery; the world’s standards for appearance might be meaningless for people trying to find their other half. The important thing is ‘the apple of my eye’, regardless of the real or virtual world.","popularity":0.4069,"poster_path":"/qAwtVUaYUCU4bec8iAMQnluEtno.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96988,"logo_path":"/akinMWSzcOArgVt7xJPdy7AOl1d.png","name":"Soo Film","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":26511,"logo_path":"/muK9W0KLV8KfEnR7MYu0YpfpdnO.png","name":"MBC","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":129416,"logo_path":"/ynjFzjybVSnYd26oYQ1VKWpc7gE.png","name":"Directors Guild of Korea","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Virtually","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"에스에프에잇: 증강콩깍지","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"SF8: Love Virtually","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Choi Si-won","original_name":"최시원","popularity":1.1139,"profile_path":"/9NWbnMRKDa6HV2OeoNw0wTeyl6t.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f66cb3384448e00386f766f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1251124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uie","original_name":"유이","popularity":0.8981,"profile_path":"/3cs6UzzHLO3MkpiKV3keodiFImu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f66cb38c1ffbd0036cc081d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2124185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Han-na","original_name":"Kim Han-na","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":"/q6fy1p35Y4dLsgwoAlxG0rXCwY6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f66cb4ce18e3f003b0aa7e4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1676565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahn Se-ha","original_name":"안세하","popularity":0.5994,"profile_path":"/ah6E27lc3UJrLPLArSEsgY4GXCu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f66cb5277070000371096e9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oh Ki-hwan","original_name":"Oh Ki-hwan","popularity":0.1583,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f66cb2957530e0036b02c2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oh Ki-hwan","original_name":"Oh Ki-hwan","popularity":0.1583,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f66cee9c1ffbd0036cc1621","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12688726","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1140,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/qAwtVUaYUCU4bec8iAMQnluEtno.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":760}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bucheon Intl.
