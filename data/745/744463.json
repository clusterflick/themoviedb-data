The film demonstrates the courage and perseverance of the city's people as they slowly begin the long and difficult process of rebuilding a city which has been destroyed by war. Shots include machinery clearing away rubble, a flag raising ceremony and distribution of food, water and a locally produced newspaper. The people of Caen begin the process of establishing lines of communication with other regions of the liberated country, searching for spies in the community and repairing the pipes and sewers buried beneath the streets. Life is slowly returning to normal as people enjoy idle time spent fishing or enjoying a concert but they also remember the allied soldiers who have given their lives for their freedom. Included is a shot of a grave-site with a cross which reads \"Bdr. Hill, E.I.; July 18, 1944\".","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":"/umug2gHVJhEFB2wSIbbXe3d2Peb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1944-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Can't Kill a City","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12997750","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/umug2gHVJhEFB2wSIbbXe3d2Peb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1944-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
