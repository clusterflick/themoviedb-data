In the meantime, the members of the team were interviewed regarding the sport, the conditions under which it takes place in Greece and their interaction with the wheelchair. The result is ‘No Heroes’, which is mainly an observation exercise on the dynamic relationship of space, body and technology, in wheelchair basketball. As wheelchair sports in Greece do not enjoy great publicity, the documentary focuses on the basic level of assemblage, hoping that observation will turn to viewpoint on the big screen.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5XeAPG2hPdVdvFE1zZcfReGhW2e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Heroes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2783536,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fragiskos Penidis","original_name":"Fragiskos Penidis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f64d1e0a0b690003732dfe1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dimitris Anagnostou","original_name":"Dimitris Anagnostou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f64d1eee33f830037f6a69b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2783535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yorgos Vitsaropoulos","original_name":"Yorgos Vitsaropoulos","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f64d1d184448e00376a89b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2783536,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fragiskos Penidis","original_name":"Fragiskos Penidis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f64d1f61684f7003643771d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1255,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5XeAPG2hPdVdvFE1zZcfReGhW2e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":837}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
