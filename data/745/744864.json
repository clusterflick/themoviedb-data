Having lost all her money, fame and fans that she had accrued over time, she seeks to recover her reputation and to return to the air by participating in a live broadcast of a new psychology-based VR game. However, she can’t overcome the trauma she faces in the game and she is trapped in the virtual world. In this fiendish game that makes people go back into their past traumas, the past she faces is even more painful. The nightmare within the game, which seems never ending, is a part of her own subconsciousness that she hasn’t addressed, or perhaps she doesn’t want to know about.","popularity":0.293,"poster_path":"/gA0V8UXhLPqdTY90Y68DAwAZ7N4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96988,"logo_path":"/akinMWSzcOArgVt7xJPdy7AOl1d.png","name":"Soo Film","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":26511,"logo_path":"/muK9W0KLV8KfEnR7MYu0YpfpdnO.png","name":"MBC","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":129416,"logo_path":"/ynjFzjybVSnYd26oYQ1VKWpc7gE.png","name":"Directors Guild of Korea","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Crow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"에스에프에잇: 하얀까마귀","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"SF8: White Crow","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1834433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hani","original_name":"하니","popularity":0.3412,"profile_path":"/6TZ49EFsCbA9eD1Y4BO9T0Ejpbr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f66c8951684f700354b26b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2752543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Se-hee","original_name":"이세희","popularity":0.6277,"profile_path":"/vpa9X8XP5R25xQ80HHFBsrnBwuH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f66c89b1684f70039595bc8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1029157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shin So-yul","original_name":"신소율","popularity":0.4046,"profile_path":"/p6BeRaRC5Ez8m15EOiVMBT9gIZa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f66c89faf3da600363276ab","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3406276,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Park Jin-sung","original_name":"Park Jin-sung","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61f7f65fb6abc400687a895b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jang Cheol-soo","original_name":"장철수","popularity":0.1651,"profile_path":"/wOIw268jENRDYJVyJzckrHutmCW.jpg","credit_id":"5f66c88c1684f70039595bae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2218891,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kang Sun-ju","original_name":"Kang Sun-ju","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f66ced75c564e0034670bae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12688722","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1140,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/gA0V8UXhLPqdTY90Y68DAwAZ7N4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":760}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bucheon Intl.
