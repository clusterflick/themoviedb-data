He wanted the “real” thing” he filmed, with the locals, being one of the first to give Polynesians, Maoris, Aborigines and Khmers a chance to appear on screen. His hybrid cinema dealt with questions of alterity, identity and representation.","popularity":0.0712,"poster_path":"/AtluBpaDpA4mlAHLgHyO2tvi2Ms.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11403,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nocturnes Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":20116,"logo_path":"/qWEOTzHiZNWnyp1b3PYB1X63vfy.png","name":"La Cinémathèque Française","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2005-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gaston Méliès and his Wandering Star Film Company","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le Voyage cinématographique de Gaston Méliès dans les mers du Sud et en Extrême-Orient","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1172420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gaston Méliès","original_name":"Gaston Méliès","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f6584c06a22270038857979","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1117817,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Raphaël Millet","original_name":"Raphaël Millet","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c230d7fc5f060168c524c9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1117817,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Raphaël Millet","original_name":"Raphaël Millet","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f65842e8258fc0036b33519","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2583634,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bertrand Amiot","original_name":"Bertrand Amiot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f658810e33f83003cf836c6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1117820,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Selleron","original_name":"Julien Selleron","popularity":0.266,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6587ee84448e00386aeb40","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2428832,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wei Yong Teo","original_name":"Wei Yong Teo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bpZdx1qhDyCc5zkFKr7O664NN6X.jpg","credit_id":"5f6587bf8258fc0036b341fb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1117815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Bohler","original_name":"Olivier Bohler","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6587995a78840033b2a917","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5738510","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AtluBpaDpA4mlAHLgHyO2tvi2Ms.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":677}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Gaston Méliès and his Wandering Star Film Company Trailer | SGIFF 2015","key":"scnQn2fW9qE","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-10-20T08:31:38.000Z","id":"61ed842ac669ad0058f4e191"}]}}}
