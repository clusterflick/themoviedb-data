At first, there are four vertical gray elements: pulsing tubes, rods or wires that divide up the black picture. At the very beginning a kind of afterimage separates from the bundle to the far left, a bright-red vibrating shadow that then moves from one rod to the next. This feedback process continues until, after a kind of explosive overload, three flickering columns of red begin to settle between the gray tubes.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TILT","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Billy Roisz","original_name":"Billy Roisz","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f66a6ec5c564e00346624a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
