All of these happen though the narration of an old man who comes back to his land after many years to find it exactly as it was when he left. Bleak. He’s searching for a pure water fountain, in vain… All he can see is bleakness and plastic flowers. Perhaps this will be his ending too?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2gcZylqfR7cRJWeNOmAx8CvnAzg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2019-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plastic Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1800254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yannis Zafiris","original_name":"Yannis Zafiris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f63d3285a78840034b3f010","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":842,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2gcZylqfR7cRJWeNOmAx8CvnAzg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":561}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
