Song Hae is the oldest active celebrity at 94 and the longest-running host of the ‘National Singing Contest.’ He has been a singer, comedian, actor, and radio DJ, but never a star. Song Hae 1927 shows a backstage face we’ve never seen. His closed eyes and serious look seem like a good place to hide sadness and pain. Song Hae is a man of few words. To the death of his wife, he only said, ‘I wish I had had a chance to say goodbye to him.’","popularity":0.2054,"poster_path":"/sfZLchdrsY960qYcvMEdumUPtyw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140999,"logo_path":null,"name":"YROTS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2021-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Song Hae 1927","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2004793,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Song Hae","original_name":"송해","popularity":0.0943,"profile_path":"/hvDaGjOaT8rYlldqZVHK8QdnGg7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f6476fea0b6900038321ce6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2653618,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kim Him-chan","original_name":"Kim Him-chan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6611e35e356a71016423a9ee","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1617951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jéro Yun","original_name":"윤재호","popularity":0.1243,"profile_path":"/5mbylu8qS5n7rarQX8sgQaV2gR3.jpg","credit_id":"5f6476ec84448e003867a53b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294117,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kim Jong-sun","original_name":"Kim Jong-sun","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f72deb61f748b00392c176a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14871868","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":843,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tSNfd9IA9GcVp8q5RyJfkKz7Mnt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2852,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/kTJy7kWoOTlLVYpLhmOQGGz4P8W.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1902},{"aspect_ratio":0.741,"height":1214,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/rwgsmIUTbXwpyEfuSBl8EVV0nU1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sfZLchdrsY960qYcvMEdumUPtyw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Busan International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
