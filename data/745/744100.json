During the speech, he also announced his resignation. For many, Nasser’s speech was the first hint of the full scope of the loss and the disillusionment with the pan-Arab vision he had led. The film weaves numerous stylistically divergent excerpts together, extracted from Egyptian movies and television series produced between 1976 and 2016; the found footage excerpts were edited to reconstruct Nasser’s speech of resignation according to the original text by using elements appropriated from popular culture.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3WFPRIpn6525qw8f7PMAWq9xTmk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2019-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return of Osiris","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Essa Grayeb","original_name":"Essa Grayeb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f63ddfc87f3f200387e45c0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Essa Grayeb","original_name":"Essa Grayeb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f63ddf3e33f830037f26c62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2782421,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Essa Grayeb","original_name":"Essa Grayeb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f63de0f87f3f2003780daf1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3WFPRIpn6525qw8f7PMAWq9xTmk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":854,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nAM1yBc0dpPTSdgqmfrnSFd6LHH.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":570}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Independent Short Awards","release_date":"2019-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
