Yet, 25 years later, South Africa is the most economically unequal country in the world and the legacy of economic apartheid continues to define day-to-day life for most South Africans. Heartbreakingly insightful, the film consists of remarkably frank interviews with a full spectrum of South Africans, from informal workers to pop culture figures to artists, politicians, and academics. Moving through the last three decades, the film follows the South African narrative from the early days of liberation to a contemporary society that is increasingly fractured and in which the culture of resistance and protest is as strong and vital as it was during the height of legislated apartheid.","popularity":0.0577,"poster_path":"/qyXneOIG35YTniko5cKScjzcWW2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140428,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anaphora Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2020-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A New Country","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masello Motana","original_name":"Masello Motana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5f665a305c564e003464bf9a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1845807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sifiso Khanyile","original_name":"Sifiso Khanyile","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6657dbe18e3f003b086c5f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1845807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sifiso Khanyile","original_name":"Sifiso Khanyile","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6657f2af3da60036304c42","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785147,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lesedi Molefi","original_name":"Lesedi Molefi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f66580b5c564e003464b369","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785149,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kabi Modiko","original_name":"Kabi Modiko","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6658325a78840034bfc239","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1845807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sifiso Khanyile","original_name":"Sifiso Khanyile","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f665847c1ffbd0035c8f587","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785150,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mabuta","original_name":"Mabuta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f665859945c200036e5347d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785152,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Shane Cooper","original_name":"Shane Cooper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f665879a0b69000383af378","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785154,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jonathan Kyriakou","original_name":"Jonathan Kyriakou","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f6658a9af3da600352a6317","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14740618","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1654,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qyXneOIG35YTniko5cKScjzcWW2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1169}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"Black Star Film Festival (online)","release_date":"2020-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Encounters South African International Documentary Festival (online)","release_date":"2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
