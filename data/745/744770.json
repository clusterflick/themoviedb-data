When a mutual friend delivered Sherman to the McDougall’s farm, the donkey was on death’s door: He had infected sores all over his bloated body and hooves grown as long and curled as witch’s nails.  The McDougalls taught Sherman how to be a donkey again, how to run, and then how to race. The story culminates in Sherman competing with his human and donkey buddies in a race in the Rockies that’s both grueling and hysterical.","popularity":0.045,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Running With Sherman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1971208,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Randall Green","original_name":"Randall Green","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f665192dbcade00371c7be3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2785103,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christopher McDougall","original_name":"Christopher McDougall","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f66517f1b1f3c003aa6a383","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
