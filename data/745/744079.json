This film is a tribute to Yufit, who died in St. Petersburg in 2016.","popularity":0.0418,"poster_path":"/759I2ZPeY0EDr9Emv6wWNpB1DId.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Riba","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":555501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evgeny Yufit","original_name":"Evgeny Yufit","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":"/8hBGhZcmMfeQcoJLSMwn0Z5jbSn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5f63d5f1156cc70035ea49a0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1736202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moira Tierney","original_name":"Moira Tierney","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f63d55987f3f2003780bcd9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/759I2ZPeY0EDr9Emv6wWNpB1DId.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
