A crossroad where beloved people meet, lonely next door people, strange travellers. Their stories are intertwined, the past meets the present, music and dancing transform reality. As the night falls and the celebration reaches its ecstatic peak, the café becomes a small Arc, travelling beyond space and time, filled with memories, wishes, and revelations. 50 actors, musicians and dancers take part in the film.","popularity":0.1911,"poster_path":"/a3ftxOhiTfGfIzqL57jDmRv0j49.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Sing, I Sing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Τραγουδώ αν τραγουδάς","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikos Kornilios","original_name":"Nikos Kornilios","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6293e63591745b006865cf3c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2647910,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aris Pavlidis","original_name":"Άρης Παυλίδης","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6293e651477215009b807824","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2026744,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Costas Bokos","original_name":"Costas Bokos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6293e646a27502005044eb81","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2711297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexios Koukias-Pantelis","original_name":"Αλέξης Κουκιάς-Παντελής","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6293e65eab5e34004f3fe1d2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1641283,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Evgenia Papageorgiou","original_name":"Ευγενία Παπαγεωργίου","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f64d3a11684f70039501fac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikos Kornilios","original_name":"Nikos Kornilios","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f64d39484448e0036676717","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1179316,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikos Kornilios","original_name":"Nikos Kornilios","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f64d399ce5d820036aa129e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2783539,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Christoforos Georgoutsos","original_name":"Christoforos Georgoutsos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f64d3b0ce5d8200349fefc1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2783538,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yiannis Misouridis","original_name":"Yiannis Misouridis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f64d3a86a2227003983620b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1641283,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Evgenia Papageorgiou","original_name":"Ευγενία Παπαγεωργίου","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f64d3b7ce5d820037a5e8d9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14192164","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"el","file_path":"/a3ftxOhiTfGfIzqL57jDmRv0j49.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fv4vmpwI4nBm2JSNvpZQWMU3BaG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"el","file_path":"/cglrs9h9fAgwiHzgDS9Z6taRb45.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
