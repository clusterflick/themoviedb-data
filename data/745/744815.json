Lane is at war with her head doctor boss at the hospital, played by Randy West, and she takes out her vaguely feminist but highly neurotic tendencies by having her creation Angela act out - offing men right and left after humping them. In her remodeled body she has super strength, but the feature never really enters sci-fi territory, and the frequent violence is kept off-screen, just implied.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/894IzdYgO9aha9ay7D7OhXKZzub.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Teutonic Goddess Angela is the perfect sex robot created for ultimate pleasures!","title":"Robofox","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Robo Fox","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2488252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Baron","original_name":"Angela Baron","popularity":1.636,"profile_path":"/hMeG9xVxoVYn63xG1lw18Efmfja.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Angela","credit_id":"5f66888aaf3da600372d96f4","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":101159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy West","original_name":"Randy West","popularity":1.999,"profile_path":"/ok1E5yuwTYLkOGYv4gcTJLr6afI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Johansson","credit_id":"5f668899c1ffbd0035c9841a","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":106428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krista Lane","original_name":"Krista Lane","popularity":1.34,"profile_path":"/tJPRaRfLKsPQ0lfroThvVLgvCC7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Pamela Moses","credit_id":"5f6688a7dbcade003625b631","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":106895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Byron","original_name":"Tom Byron","popularity":9.471,"profile_path":"/8AKqVx8JMJNy8zLR78zWaJB4jo0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"5f6688b6945c200036e61167","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":574169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erica Boyer","original_name":"Erica Boyer","popularity":5.671,"profile_path":"/9QCg0lubGIzpwpiZIxUeWQk1GRc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bar Girl with Pamela","credit_id":"5f6688c2dbcade003625b79f","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":134590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Dee","original_name":"Billy Dee","popularity":2.691,"profile_path":"/eTTJETY044MooQxbil8V5jTnPPT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Male Nurse","credit_id":"5f6688dd1684f7003750b033","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2785319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Rome","original_name":"Eric Rome","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Theater Guy with Angela","credit_id":"5f6688f3e04d8a00392d2940","order":6},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2785320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon","original_name":"Brandon","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Ted (as Edward Hillegar)","credit_id":"5f66894357530e0039aa589d","order":7},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":2394286,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roger Carr","original_name":"Roger Carr","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Bartender","credit_id":"5f6689845c564e003363e1eb","order":8},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1111552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Jones","original_name":"Mick Jones","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/bCOZxnUpubqK77KPmb3mDc6wouK.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Black Guy in Bar","credit_id":"62a172abdc1cb40fb51627f4","order":9},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1726370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Bright","original_name":"Lisa Bright","popularity":4.04,"profile_path":"/6YiEzzXvRTd3Ll4BW6HVYHIB2O0.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Darcy (as Lissa Bright)","credit_id":"5f6689efe18e3f003b095c26","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":53568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Thomas","original_name":"Paul Thomas","popularity":3.226,"profile_path":"/1GrKUcorxN0NAONsFMCznEhc9um.jpg","credit_id":"5f6689fd6a2227003986849c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0190716","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/894IzdYgO9aha9ay7D7OhXKZzub.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/f256Cj95Tqol72nVyuXfHeyLSw3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
