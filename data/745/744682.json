His Arcades Project, a monumental study of nineteenth century Paris, is set in the context of his life and times. His friendships with Brecht, Scholem, Arendt and Adorno and his romances are evoked.

The film includes photographs, documents, letters and manuscripts from the Benjamin archives in Berlin and Jerusalem, prints and photographs from the Bibliotheque national in Paris, interviews with leading Benjamin scholars and archival film of Paris and Berlin in the 1920s and 1930s.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":"/eJcI7sDH3pRSi1xEZE8vVG2ncLH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Passages of Walter Benjamin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2784747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judith Wechsler","original_name":"Judith Wechsler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f65e73d5a78840036afa16b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4382772","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1813,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eJcI7sDH3pRSi1xEZE8vVG2ncLH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1208}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
