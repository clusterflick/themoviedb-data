Director Lee Soojung calls her ‘sister J’. 10 years into the fight for reinstatement, Jaechun now writes, plays guitar, and sings while living in a tent. She says her personality has changed after 7 years of being laid-off from “originally timid” to being very lively. Sister J deals with a struggle for reinstatement, but it is actually a film about a single person, as stated in the title. This documentary brings artistic vitality to the ‘4,464 days’ Sister J spends on the site, with lines and music driven from the forms of the play into the cinema.","popularity":0.3389,"poster_path":"/ssl6PUWg3exfXBlNuF9vd4Uz9tf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53366,"logo_path":"/5fbWZ4BsG9gh50cay7lOj5aKguu.png","name":"Cinema Dal","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":150525,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mitte des Lebens","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2022-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sister J","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"재춘 언니","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3783656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"임재춘","original_name":"임재춘","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6370a95b21621b00cd62e95a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3783657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"김경봉","original_name":"김경봉","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6370a95f02842000a3212a06","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3783658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"장석천","original_name":"장석천","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6370a9651684f700c4eb2bfb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3783659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"이인근","original_name":"이인근","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6370a96981383100abf66ecf","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2491081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Soo-jung","original_name":"이수정","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yhhu4c2ywOAKV5JExXZhKQdRqE0.jpg","credit_id":"5f6475fdaf3da60037268977","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2491081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Soo-jung","original_name":"이수정","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yhhu4c2ywOAKV5JExXZhKQdRqE0.jpg","credit_id":"6046d14c0102c90044f01c47","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2491081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lee Soo-jung","original_name":"이수정","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yhhu4c2ywOAKV5JExXZhKQdRqE0.jpg","credit_id":"6046d155e18b9700591014cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":843,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/45jeFmmFIHDE7mcH3tTCE4egdt9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/ssl6PUWg3exfXBlNuF9vd4Uz9tf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c9Nb8WmLNbtPhTus9TytNT4Y49h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Busan International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"#BIFF2020 Wide Angle - Sister J / 와이드 앵글 - 재춘언니","key":"4u5-hSIVyHs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-23T09:00:00.000Z","id":"5f6b1103688cd0003724ceb6"}]}}}
