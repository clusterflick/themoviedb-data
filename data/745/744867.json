As the end approaches, people reveal all sort of hidden aptitudes, even psychic abilities. Hye Hwa tries to prevent the world from coming to an end with Kim Nam Woo, a forever-single type, who just feels lonely, even at that critical moment. Can they save the world and start love? One week is enough time for the world to end, but not enough for love to begin. For the time being, there aren’t many things left to do, but the end of the world would be the moment I disappear. However, if I existed somewhere else, the world would carry on regardless. Baby It’s over outside holds a question about the existence of both the world and us. All the characters in the film are adorable, particularly the psychics who come forward to the save the world: Hye Hwa, who is embarrassed about her trivial abilities, and Nam Woo, who believes he has met Hye Hwa before.","popularity":0.415,"poster_path":"/bNQ5OQvJvIrFGDR1UHdEI61XRMk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96988,"logo_path":"/akinMWSzcOArgVt7xJPdy7AOl1d.png","name":"Soo Film","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":26511,"logo_path":"/muK9W0KLV8KfEnR7MYu0YpfpdnO.png","name":"MBC","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":129416,"logo_path":"/ynjFzjybVSnYd26oYQ1VKWpc7gE.png","name":"Directors Guild of Korea","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baby It's Over Outside","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"에스에프에잇: 일주일 만에 사랑할 순 없다","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"You Can’t Be In Love After a Week","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"SF8: Baby It’s Over Outside","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Lee","original_name":"이다윗","popularity":0.549,"profile_path":"/qWGDFlr47d2AJLtJsOEmfmaC21l.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f66c9ab5a78840034c20803","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1576065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shin Eun-soo","original_name":"신은수","popularity":1.3416,"profile_path":"/6JOcSSp46RUXTqb9lvAYxBSoqb8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f66c9b2af3da600372ea5a6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1891352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hwang Jeong-min","original_name":"황정민","popularity":0.2828,"profile_path":"/eKD0YL9E72a3JCECIL9ipVTTQvw.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f66c9bc77070000371090bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2033111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bae Hae-seon","original_name":"배해선","popularity":0.6398,"profile_path":"/hqR7waJDYkOspnosemMkD2Wm4rO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f66c9c184448e00396a8fe2","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1489282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahn Gooc-jin","original_name":"안국진","popularity":0.1416,"profile_path":"/oMHYRe7f6rplhp8m1tJIBQWyApT.jpg","credit_id":"5f66c9a308cf87003948751e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2740234,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Han Boon-wi","original_name":"Han Boon-wi","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f66cec3945c200037e37edd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12688720","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1140,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bNQ5OQvJvIrFGDR1UHdEI61XRMk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":760}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bucheon Intl.
