A Clandestine American Military Agency, 'Black Halo', is forced to move a vital asset out of the warzone in Amrakistan. Mike McGuirk sends in a Black-Ops team led by Segar to securely extract Moshin Dewar and his newest invention. Moshin sensing something is not right, escapes Segar by jumping out of a flying plane. Using his device to survive, he literally falls into the clutches of a slave mining magnate, Anwar the Butcher, now holding Moshin for trespassing on his land and destroying one of his vehicles. Segar fails in to negotiate with Anwar. McGuirk under extreme pressure from his superiors who fear he is losing control of the situation, switches to Plan B.","popularity":0.4152,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead On Time","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Madsen","original_name":"Michael Madsen","popularity":1.5049,"profile_path":"/2pKJJKeCggtLOE4hzqgq07KYqFh.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mike McGuirk","credit_id":"5fc3b9fbb84f94003f0b64bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":566889,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Sjogren","original_name":"John Sjogren","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tom Bruise","credit_id":"5fc3ba2b62fcd3003fbec281","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2874744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohammed Zouaoui","original_name":"Mohammed Zouaoui","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Moshin Dewar","credit_id":"5fc3ba5d0328b9003e6975d2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1222676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Colton","original_name":"Scott Colton","popularity":0.2727,"profile_path":"/5b9p6lQd2vUA5X2cdOqfoJmq4Bc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fc3ba96a8858700410868b9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2874745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rish Mustaine","original_name":"Rish Mustaine","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc3bacadcf8750041d6735f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4173184","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
