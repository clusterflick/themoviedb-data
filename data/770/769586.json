Faced with two authoritarian fathers, two sons, both of whom are thwarted lovers, turn to the crafty Scapin, who is driven by a mad desire for revenge. The character is a double of Scaramouche, the Italian actor of the adventurous life whom Molière admired: “to tell you the truth, there are few things that are impossible for me, when I put my mind to them” declares the buffoonish servant whose name, as Denis Podalydès points out, derives his from the Italian scappare which means “to escape”, “to scamper off”. Scapin is beaten with a stick at one point but also gets his own back and, against a background of ransom demands and paternal contradictions, he comes up with an avalanche of stratagems and other tricks, which Molière excels in depicting.","popularity":0.2726,"poster_path":"/AnHwWoaVxgvcBfjEjI1BLoKFT0c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88501,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Comédie-Française","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Fourberies de Scapin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1637273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilles David","original_name":"Gilles David","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/sMVoOKPb3W97V1RtNFhuXAoHbRG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Argante","credit_id":"5fc29a3bb84f9400420a370b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1082093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bakary Sangaré","original_name":"Bakary Sangaré","popularity":0.1304,"profile_path":"/pO4gUocJFJ5D0OsnvDXHC8G2MP9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sylvestre","credit_id":"5fc29a55cf9ba30041c159a6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Lavernhe","original_name":"Benjamin Lavernhe","popularity":0.4065,"profile_path":"/e0wFxLvNHS0XmdRKpMeIytDFZmO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Scapin","credit_id":"5fc29a63174a870041e1a5d3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Didier Sandre","original_name":"Didier Sandre","popularity":0.1607,"profile_path":"/xR6wLnoawLAoh9pTHRcACKl2L2m.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Géronte","credit_id":"5fc29a750328b9003f6862b1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1315534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adeline D'Hermy","original_name":"Adeline D'Hermy","popularity":0.0851,"profile_path":"/lx16ybQmFwP2WSQNT4Yyrwd9QxZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Zerbinette","credit_id":"5fc29a8e63536a003f24c2e1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1164116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaël Kamilindi","original_name":"Gaël Kamilindi","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/zqICs8gyWWcfF3o8Ft199l7n2s8.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Léandre","credit_id":"5fc29aa80328b9003f6862e0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Frison","original_name":"Julien Frison","popularity":0.5886,"profile_path":"/c2SdLPtRv6mNufS3xcmuo1y52H8.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Octave","credit_id":"5fc29abab84f94004009abd5","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Podalydès","original_name":"Denis Podalydès","popularity":0.4956,"profile_path":"/uKEvUFBjdkDuNQgDoEVwFw1TvSa.jpg","credit_id":"5fc29a0f3a340b003edcda87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":178018,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Christian Lacroix","original_name":"Christian Lacroix","popularity":0.096,"profile_path":"/vOwUXJjHC2nKTRJlGXv2kfOZGr3.jpg","credit_id":"5fc29a22875d1a003ff0ff0c","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q101095630","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AnHwWoaVxgvcBfjEjI1BLoKFT0c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4326,"name":"theater play"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"French\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"French\"}","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
