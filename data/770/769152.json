The reason this was so important is that the Japanese high command was ordering the execution of all prisoners when it appeared that the camps were soon to be liberated. So, in the case of this camp, it meant a covert operation well behind enemy lines in order to get to the guys before it was too late. The episode consists of many, many interviews--including several living POWs, a Philippino partisan, members of the assault team, their second in command and some historians.","popularity":0.5275,"poster_path":"/rrXNmkgqgt2tvMfBKn2Sxbj3tur.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87957,"logo_path":null,"name":"PBS American Experience","origin_country":""},{"id":10197,"logo_path":"/lRah8iyzBZJ90ZgsKUIWUU9XnRu.png","name":"GBH","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The most daring rescue of World War II.","title":"Bataan Rescue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bataan Rescue (American Experience)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bataan Rescue: American Experience","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"American Experience: Bataan Rescue","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Glenn","original_name":"Scott Glenn","popularity":2.0223,"profile_path":"/keBKcMPojtRTi5ImLXOoKDmDbqU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5fc13e768efe73003d6c4202","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Axelrod","original_name":"David Axelrod","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/ijzFHnUMpK93kGKBKZkEg4H5EKW.jpg","credit_id":"64a99b9166a0d300ade7a924","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Axelrod","original_name":"David Axelrod","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/ijzFHnUMpK93kGKBKZkEg4H5EKW.jpg","credit_id":"64a99b9f66a0d3013a71faa2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115271,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brian McDairmant","original_name":"Brian McDairmant","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a99ba96a344800c9fa8d71","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":582639,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kate Amend","original_name":"Kate Amend","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a99bb4b686b9010e0ba028","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3278,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mark Adler","original_name":"Mark Adler","popularity":0.1471,"profile_path":"/g31rIHaTBeK0xHHMezl7NwmzYtP.jpg","credit_id":"64a99bbf66a0d3011d7ad4f5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2124143,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Mark Bautista","original_name":"Mark Bautista","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a99bd2d1a89300c574deda","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup & Hair"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2659695,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Dave Riley","original_name":"Dave Riley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a99be49c97bd00ff1a9c19","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Jones","original_name":"Peter Jones","popularity":0.0726,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc13eb6dd926a004078f76d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0511738","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rrXNmkgqgt2tvMfBKn2Sxbj3tur.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2003-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
