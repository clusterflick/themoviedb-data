Today she lives as a man. She is a sworn virgin. The tradition of sworn virgins started 600 years ago: if there were no sons, one of the daughters had to live as a man, to maintain the family. Some women have chosen this path because they wanted to be free. Bedrie couldn't accept the restrictions of a woman's life. One day she gets a call from the young Adele (26) living in Tirana. Adele is searching for her identity, she wants to live self-determined in patriarchal Albania. Adele hopes to get answers and Bedrie is proud to share.","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":109983,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmkantine UG","origin_country":""},{"id":5975,"logo_path":"/vvjgoKygWWYZvYyidT3RmOCq5If.png","name":"YLE","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"THE SWORN VIRGIN AND THE GIRL","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Birthe Templin","original_name":"Birthe Templin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc2987b0328b9003e682093","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristine Nrecaj","original_name":"Kristine Nrecaj","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc2986ca8858700400661ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DOK Leipzig","release_date":"2024-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
