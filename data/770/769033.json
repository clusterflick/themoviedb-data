(Gottfried Benn)  Using tableau-like takes of different places of the Muscovite suburb (Moskatchka), a poor quarter of the Latvian capital Riga, the film shows fragments of the choreography of life and combines them to form a picture of reality. Without making any comments, the camera observes the people’s behaviour, which reminds you of the early Flaherty and how his camera “stuck to” his film heroes . It also reminds you of the beginning of film art when the recording of reality on a strip of film was an event, in spite of its accidental character.","popularity":0.108,"poster_path":"/td3SKdxWbT5ivyrAkL5SdNQ5iY0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kino Kombat","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":93609,"logo_path":null,"name":"Screen Vision","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2004-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moskatchka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1105423,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Aleksandrs Grebņevs","original_name":"Aleksandrs Grebņevs","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":"/cQ9eehyZ4ABXssfsURJ0GasO6bV.jpg","credit_id":"5fc0b94d9f51af0041e89e5a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2861931,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laima Freimane","original_name":"Laima Freimane","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc0b9ff9d2b630042f2657b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annett Schütze","original_name":"Annett Schütze","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc0b984175051003f13d7aa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annett Schütze","original_name":"Annett Schütze","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc0b93225b95500399ba395","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871694,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annett Schütze","original_name":"Annett Schütze","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc0b9cb9c97bd003fa43cf0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1989798,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ruslans Gailitis","original_name":"Ruslans Gailitis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc0b963dd926a0040786a7f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591878,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Fred Kelemen","original_name":"Fred Kelemen","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/qBcX8xfAHifClU7IjQMRmaAMEXU.jpg","credit_id":"5fc0ba2517505100421647fc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0870939","wikidata_id":"Q131623507","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1267,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/td3SKdxWbT5ivyrAkL5SdNQ5iY0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
