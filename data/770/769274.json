The Curonians lived in the western parts of modern-day Latvia from the 5th until the 16th century. They eventually merged with other Baltic peoples to form the Latvian nation. The docu-mentary utilizes reenacted scenes, interviews with known historians and 3D animation to tell the story of this brave warrior tribe. They were feared even by their Scandinavian neighbors and remained one of the last remaining pagan tribes in Europe. Evidence of Curonian rituals can be found as late as the 19th century. The film offers a brief insight into their lives, culture, customs and beliefs. It tells about their moments of strength, victory and also their defeats.","popularity":0.1287,"poster_path":"/mixdzJRkmjwWxWxRzIySeTDcvYj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tritone Studios","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2015-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Curonians","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raitis Ābele","original_name":"Raitis Ābele","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc18fa963536a0042233a64","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2828909,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Toms Ķencis","original_name":"Toms Ķencis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc18febd2f5b50040d56153","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2634361,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jānis Indriks","original_name":"Jānis Indriks","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc18f860ed2ab0040cc9076","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raitis Ābele","original_name":"Raitis Ābele","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc18f27875d1a003def9b2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lauris Ābele","original_name":"Lauris Ābele","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc18f3c875d1a003eefa0ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2850992,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mārcis Ābele","original_name":"Mārcis Ābele","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc18f59b84f94003f08ab79","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872662,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kaspars Bārbals","original_name":"Kaspars Bārbals","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc1907c2d8ef30040541428","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lauris Ābele","original_name":"Lauris Ābele","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc18fca0ed2ab003fcc933f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raitis Ābele","original_name":"Raitis Ābele","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc1905e2bcf67003cbe6b4b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2044647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raitis Ābele","original_name":"Raitis Ābele","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc18fdc4d6791003cd6c13d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2851064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zane Sietniece","original_name":"Zane Sietniece","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc18f97875d1a003eefa147","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mixdzJRkmjwWxWxRzIySeTDcvYj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Kurši filmas treileris","key":"BP2WkHMSvU8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-09-17T17:55:40.000Z","id":"6007516b869e75003f8664f5"}]}}}
