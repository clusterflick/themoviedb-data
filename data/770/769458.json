Will the community and its residents ever be the same?  Farewell Regent is a 90-minute documentary that captures the Regent Park community of downtown Toronto (the place where social housing began in Canada) in the midst of the largest housing redevelopment project in North America. With this transition, it will go from a site of 100% social housing to a mixed-income community where condo units will outnumber the social housing units 4 to 1.  The documentary profiles past and current tenants, city officials, developers and housing advocates to get an inside view of the complex issues, emotions and drama that are involved in such a massive redevelopment.","popularity":0.1185,"poster_path":"/3TDlvJpVxlscgEu8kXnJVza1rUU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151272,"logo_path":null,"name":"Syncopated Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Farewell Regent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3019465,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jonah Zapparoli","original_name":"Jonah Zapparoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6057d18d0792e10028ef1ef4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1627912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christene Browne","original_name":"Christene Browne","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/g4Mt14UY41DjQwVLV5pSOkpK3us.jpg","credit_id":"60581adcb39e350028f40b93","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1627912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christene Browne","original_name":"Christene Browne","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/g4Mt14UY41DjQwVLV5pSOkpK3us.jpg","credit_id":"60581ae78c44b9002a6bbd01","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1627912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christene Browne","original_name":"Christene Browne","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/g4Mt14UY41DjQwVLV5pSOkpK3us.jpg","credit_id":"60581ad1fd4f80002970535c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1627912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christene Browne","original_name":"Christene Browne","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/g4Mt14UY41DjQwVLV5pSOkpK3us.jpg","credit_id":"5fc253882bcf67003cbf42be","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9292504","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xH1dwSpMveOkoIj8hpuF4GDhvGT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1282}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":855,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3TDlvJpVxlscgEu8kXnJVza1rUU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":570}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Farewell Regent trailer","key":"picvfTQ4NhE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-02-14T14:47:32.000Z","id":"654ac0fd1ac2927b2c81f98f"}]}}}
