The Vasulkas were interested in the building of control systems for the manipulation of electronic signals, resulting in their collaborations with several designers and engineers. One such example was the Multi-Level Keyer, a tool designed in 1973 by George Brown at the request of the Vasulkas, who were interested in expanding their range of source imagery. Steinaâ€™s manipulation of the image through keying, layering, and the manual control of luminance is seen here.","popularity":0.0849,"poster_path":"/dt24A11YAizkjscvA8I9TK36OEY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orbital Obsessions","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steina Vasulka","original_name":"Steina Vasulka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fc154368efe73003d6c6ad6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steina Vasulka","original_name":"Steina Vasulka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc1543e54508d0040d9061f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1462455,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Woody Vasulka","original_name":"Woody Vasulka","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc15445c613ce00418000c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dt24A11YAizkjscvA8I9TK36OEY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"National Gallery of Art: Machine Vision: Monitors and Space by Steina","release_date":"2020-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
