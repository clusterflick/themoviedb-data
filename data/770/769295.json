What role can architects have in addressing homelessness? And how can cities become better homes for all? The documentary film What It Takes to Make a Home follows a conversation between architects Michael Maltzan (Los Angeles) and Alexander Hagner (Vienna), who have been grappling with these questions over many years and through various projects. While the cities and the political and economic contexts in which Maltzan and Hagner work differ, both search for long-term strategies for housing instead of reacting with ad hoc solutions. Focussing on some causes and conditions of homelessness, the film questions the role architects can play toward overcoming the stigmatization of people experiencing it, in order to build more inclusive cities.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/maXGnNUxKWFxILFRZuqfwFNuTsL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74026,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canadian Centre for Architecture","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What It Takes to Make a Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872795,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Christian Lange","original_name":"Christian Lange","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc1a9d8875d1a003fefcdc9","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235298,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jonas Spriestersbach","original_name":"Jonas Spriestersbach","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc1aa6b420228003fbf72f1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872800,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sophie Couture","original_name":"Sophie Couture","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc1aab80328b9003c67046b","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872791,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marie-Josée Lagrange","original_name":"Marie-Josée Lagrange","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc1a9384d6791003cd6ed7d","department":"Production","job":"Post Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872788,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alexandre Lamy","original_name":"Alexandre Lamy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc1a8c3d2f5b50041d59b49","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872792,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vincent Cardinal","original_name":"Vincent Cardinal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc1a96063536a003f2372cd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Schwartz","original_name":"Daniel Schwartz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc1a6e90ed2ab0041ccc905","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872789,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pierre-Luc Paré","original_name":"Pierre-Luc Paré","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc1a8e1875d1a003eefd5d3","department":"Crew","job":"Post Production Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872799,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Camille Lavallée Prairie","original_name":"Camille Lavallée Prairie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc1aaa2875d1a003cefce64","department":"Production","job":"Production Coordinator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872793,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vincent Cardinal","original_name":"Vincent Cardinal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc1a9734d6791003bd6faec","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872796,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hannah M.
