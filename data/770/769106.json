In parallel to splitting electrons in the laboratory, he seeks a connection to the Almighty, and is a dreamer, an exceptional scientist, family man and educator, socially active and civically minded. What allows him, unlike most of us, to be so harmonious and seemingly omniscient? Together with quantum physicist, theological authority and Latvian patriot Vyacheslav Kashcheyev, the film searches for the code to modern-day life.","popularity":0.325,"poster_path":"/8P5DgP50wl25UhhWNBIiOTRUQ36.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85188,"logo_path":"/dt6pAG7kCbPrzwcp92NMxTGJyLJ.png","name":"Juris Podnieks Studio","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2016-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quantum Code","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santa Skutele","original_name":"Santa Skutele","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc10a9cc613ce00407ed647","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Santa Skutele","original_name":"Santa Skutele","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc10aa6c613ce003e7f064d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2871996,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jurijs Skorobogatovs","original_name":"Jurijs Skorobogatovs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc10aca9d2b630040f27066","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297711,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anrijs Krenbergs","original_name":"Anrijs Krenbergs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc10af19d2b630040f270a0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297708,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sandra Alksne","original_name":"Sandra Alksne","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fc10b0625b955003a9baa5e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1761335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antra Cilinska","original_name":"Antra Cilinska","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/cCSilJuyy3zMESQ4TmdNcwyCbtH.jpg","credit_id":"5fc10b1d54508d003dd9eb4b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1697,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8P5DgP50wl25UhhWNBIiOTRUQ36.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1144}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":199065,"name":"physics professor"},{"id":217034,"name":"quantum physics"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
