The result? The Lotus 18 followed by a race version designed and built in collaboration with Keith Duckworth. Not only was this the start of an association with Cosworth but also the debut of Scottish driver Jim Clark. The company was to enjoy new success in the Formula Junior Class; the Elite a role in GT racing; and a new GP car debuted at Argentina with Innes Ireland. Neville Hay recounts the events of these three intensive years in the Lotus story. All the major races and personalities of the era are featured, including Moss and Surtees at the 1960 GP de Monaco, 1960 Le Mans 24 hour, Dutch GP debut of the Lotus 25, 1962 Goodwood Easter meeting, British, German and South African GP. You also hear from major players of the era - Duckworth, Ireland, Wagstaff, Surtees, Moss, Taylor and Lovely.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1pqtq2QmWPR9VrSLLByr8hgplXl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Time of Change","title":"The Lotus Story Part 2 - Time of Change","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gGwDEAqixCDdNQA64mDJwFSzStn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1pqtq2QmWPR9VrSLLByr8hgplXl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":359471,"name":"formula 1"},{"id":367013,"name":"lotus racing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
