He puts on a strong front, but is floundering and he hates his life until a beautiful Black woman, Gloria, arrives on the scene. They secretly marry against the family’s will – not only is she Black but she is also an American. PUSHING PAST THE BAD tells an unusual story of love that transcends romance. Gloria and Stann find themselves in a world falling apart. Stann is tortured by his crazy brutal father and the rest of the family. Meanwhile, the police pursue Stann for murder but it was the father who was the assassin. Stann refuses to denounce him, and he disappears, leaving the family to Gloria who had already left behind a troubled world in the United States. Gloria is now both provocateur and mediator. A strange and poignant fable.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In today's changing world, where nothing can be counted on, how does a family survive?","title":"Pushing Past the Bad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2573491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Philippe","original_name":"Pierre Philippe","popularity":0.075,"profile_path":"/ikxAeBLSF8n8J7ax0jfD0Q2KXCX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Stann","credit_id":"6984f2ad3b83f2b85d6eedb0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2053685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelly Lawson","original_name":"Nelly Lawson","popularity":0.2466,"profile_path":"/jMWSq5p5bpaOgxfkR23ZbcGtKNd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gloria","credit_id":"6984f2bc8902ed3a8c36397d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":575910,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Penny Allen","original_name":"Penny Allen","popularity":0.0885,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6984f283969e6a36624f6c59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464835,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mike S.
