The Rytmi-Pojat, led by Eugen Malmsténin (1907-1993), perform 1930s hits in Suomi-Film's excellent musical film, including the tango Vain tämä yö on meyän, written by Veikko Virmajoki, which was once banned from being performed on Yleisradio. The Rytmi-Pojat's repertoire was particularly popular with urban youth in the 1930s. The film is accompanied by hidden advertising of sheet music and records. The phenomenon that led to the end of the tax reduction system for Finnish short films in the mid-1960s was therefore already present early on.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21046,"logo_path":"/ghVwr2Y0DgRbg3b4Mm3FVdhJ6Fo.png","name":"Suomi-Filmi","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1936-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rytmiä ja iskelmiä","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Rhythm and Hits","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3419113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sven Grönholm","original_name":"Sven Grönholm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"69852d36d0ffa9d37c691223","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5989534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olof Larsen","original_name":"Olof Larsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"69852d45e73ac5bcdb48d915","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1703111","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fi","note":"","release_date":"1936-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
