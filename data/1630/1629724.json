From Hurricane Beryl, a category 5 storm with 165 mph winds to Hurricane Helene - one of the deadliest since Katrina of 2005 - and Hurricane Milton, the most powerful Category 5 hurricane reaching 180 mph.  We reveal how hurricane meteorologists are trying to stay one step ahead with cutting edge weather satellites that patrol the planet, warning of when and where a hurricane will hit land. And we join a team of Hurricane Hunters as they fly into the eye of these fierce storms on rugged aircraft crammed with several tons of scientific kit. We also learn from a scientist at NASA who experimented with hurricane flights which were unmanned, using repurposed military drones called Global Hawks to fly into the world's most deadly storms.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":169121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silverlining Rights","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hurricanes are the deadliest storms on Earth and climate change is making them even more intense.","title":"Hurricanes From Above","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zA3nZdEELxIaQ62KnNhybQwFNJL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qSCY2Nyd1wpOv1jCAkUtAN9RwlB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2215,"name":"hurricane"},{"id":3694,"name":"weather"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
