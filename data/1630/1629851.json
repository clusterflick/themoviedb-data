Revered by fellow artists and averse to labels and styles, Artschwager produced an extensive body of work spanning Pop, Minimalism, and Conceptual art, always with humor and wit. The documentary traces the artist's career as it follows him through his studio, playing piano at home, walking the canyons of New Mexico, and traveling the world. Interviews with Agnes Gund, John Torreano, and Malcolm Morley complete the mosaic of this irreverent artist.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ykOqJVOn4PwSH3KvvHHLAvsHqqx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shut Up and Look","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1767109,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maryte Kavaliauskas","original_name":"Maryte Kavaliauskas","popularity":0.2195,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6984f9442f75bd2b194f6ba1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ykOqJVOn4PwSH3KvvHHLAvsHqqx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
