This incident served as a pretext for the Nazis to carry out pogroms against the Jewish population on the night of November 9-10, 1938. In addition to providing historical insight into the background of the events, which were euphemistically referred to as \"Reichskristallnacht\" (Night of Broken Glass), the film uses the person and story of the then 17-year-old to illustrate the conflicts that persecuted young people grew up with in the 1930s.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Attentäter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5985805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz van Dijk","original_name":"Lutz van Dijk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698351d9b59342c49f8e60bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
