On the surface, he lives like any other boy his age. But behind the mask hides a boy living a nightmare—a nightmare fueled by silence, the fear of speaking up, and the dread of what might happen next.  Elias and Adryen, his best friends, can feel something is wrong. They watch their friend change, without truly understanding the reality of what is unfolding.  The short film follows this internal struggle: the story of a teenager trapped by what he dares not say, and the fragile thread that still connects him to those who could save him.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/d2sG5WlY3sAfu3fl89MbRWXkRLx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2026-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Voice of Silence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5988030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Owen Paté","original_name":"Owen Paté","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Aaron","credit_id":"698488b0c0f61b819c6e75d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5988035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eliott H.","original_name":"Eliott H.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Naël","credit_id":"698488e2723f9772b06e7640","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5988036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar L.","original_name":"Oscar L.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Elias","credit_id":"698488f90012c6ccec912f0e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5988037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiago D.","original_name":"Tiago D.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Adryen","credit_id":"6984890dcff396614474ad65","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5988038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elioth P.","original_name":"Elioth P.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lyam","credit_id":"698489409cef7884f236359a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5988030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Owen Paté","original_name":"Owen Paté","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69848835d9cb8320896e775c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xcyaUKBx8STLkhV4OmooNfQz2eG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1247,"iso_3166_1":"FR","iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/d2sG5WlY3sAfu3fl89MbRWXkRLx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":832}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2026-01-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"La VOIX du SILENCE - Parler pour tout arrêter | Moyen Métrage contre le harcèlement","key":"FJiNet6Zdk8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2026-01-06T17:01:46.000Z","id":"69848ab6723f9772b06e765f"}]}}}
