He feels comfortable up there, because from here he has a clear view of his neighborhood, Kuptschino, a dreary concrete housing estate. He can observe crimes. And he can intervene. As proof, he pulls out an imaginary pistol and fires it wildly. The man is a member of a club dedicated to fighting crime. After all, every child knows that crime is part of everyday life in Russia.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aus der Praxis, für die Praxis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0115594","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
