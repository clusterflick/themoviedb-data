After more than 40 years of silence and social and artistic exclusion of the Roma, ROMATHAN is a first cautious step toward carving out a \"space of normality\" in an otherwise hostile environment. The ensemble has given us an insight into its everyday theater life, and we encounter its members as artistic and creative people who are learning to regain their dignity and self-confidence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romathan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2673951,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Monika Hielscher","original_name":"Monika Hielscher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69846e950e6514cdf5912e1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
