How can we visually recreate a memory? We walked and filmed, photographed and painted, got to know each other and told our stories. An experience transformed into a story that speaks of a shared journey, made up of filming, changes of season, conversations about the moon, and exchanges of techniques. Inspired by “Dark Side of the Moon,” we tried to represent the intimate and personal emotions that came to us through the album. Each song has a language, each movement a color, each sound an expression. What remains today, half a century later? Something inexplicable, perhaps. A wonderful creation of friendship and mutual artistic esteem, the (re)creation of multiple memories, which overlap like membranes on the screen. - Erik Negro","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Return to the Moon (or Nothing)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2527305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Negro","original_name":"Erik Negro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6984da12c43a59b9a94f6aa3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5988768,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bea Morino","original_name":"Bea Morino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6984da2f66777e15ba74adc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"The film screened at Pesaro International Festival of New Cinema","release_date":"2026-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
