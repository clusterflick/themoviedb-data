Kaven is just there - in the background of different lives, different worlds. He doesn't chase. He doesn't speak. Most people don't even notice him.But reality slowly begins to feel... off. Small details change. Memories don't line up. Familiar places feel unfamiliar. As the universes start to overlap, one truth becomes impossible to ignore: Kaven isn't the threat.  He's the proof that something has already gone wrong. And by the time you realize what he really is, it's too late.","popularity":0.7571,"poster_path":"/i7kApUol0YB0QLLbbCW7xHQrZB7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Kaven","title":"The Kaven Universe","video":true,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5986293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandon Ostopowicz","original_name":"Brandon Ostopowicz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Actor","credit_id":"69838549f2774f7d431ef2bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5986295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brett Oddsen <","original_name":"Brett Oddsen <","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Actor/editor","credit_id":"6983855b826f94b02afa66c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5986296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaven Koeffler","original_name":"Kaven Koeffler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Actor/editor","credit_id":"698385669e786ec650301891","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5986297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enrique Proell","original_name":"Enrique Proell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Actor/filmer","credit_id":"69838573d330e85a848e6324","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5986299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Grable","original_name":"Thomas Grable","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Actor/filmer","credit_id":"69838593252ba469598e6246","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sMd7BHkNhhzYxvCe5jueAsEuh2c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hDtQ35FZOb8HpWOnhry4oYsdVdw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i7kApUol0YB0QLLbbCW7xHQrZB7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":325818,"name":"frightened"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2026-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
