Wherever Nele ends up, she feels that something is missing, something she believes can only be found elsewhere. No sooner has she settled down with her dog in Amsterdam and furnished her caravan than she no longer knows why she is there. So she sets off again: to Berlin to visit a friend she can't find, to Dresden, which was once her home and is now unbearable to her, to Hamburg, where she gets into trouble with the police and the money from social services fails to materialize. Resigned and completely exhausted, Nele finally hears about a way out, a way of life she can imagine without having to stay in one place.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ritt über die Grenze","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosemarie Blank","original_name":"Rosemarie Blank","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698356544d8e36e0ac8e615b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
