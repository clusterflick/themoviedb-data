An important appointment. But the elevator malfunctions and becomes his prison... Two texts by playwright Heiner Müller that ironically tell the story of two men. Composer Heiner Goebbels has interwoven these texts and adapted them musically into an audio play: \"The Liberation of Prometheus.\" Theo Janßen composed the images to accompany it: documentary, staged, and journalistic images. Archive footage, photographs, drawings—not illustrative, but associative and contrapuntal. The result is a kind of \"film opera\" or \"film musical.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adler passen auf Menschen auf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
