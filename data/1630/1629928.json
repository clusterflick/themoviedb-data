As well as the scene of the arrival of the bodies at Trieste and of the funeral rites there are those taken on that fateful 28th of June 1914: the Archduke and his wife getting out of the car to enter the Sarajevo City Hall a few minutes after a dynamite attempt had wounded a member of the escort. Eclair even manages to film the scene of the assassination; playing on the confusion, the clothes on the ground and signs of the damage. This is followed by scenes of the city, the castle home of the couple and the funerals.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1914-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sarajewo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Sarajevo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
