A landscape devoid of raptors is without ecological integrity, the barometer of our collective wellbeing. High atop these remote ridgelines above the Great Basin, a region of unforgiving deserts, mountain ranges and sagebrush steppes, is the frontline of raptor conservation. Our journey began and ended with the whisk of broad wings. The golden eagle took flight and floated skyward. We had joined the migration and followed golden eagles for thousands of miles-a fraction of their entire route-and just long enough to peek into their remarkable journey. We got to know and admire the biologists and passionate volunteers who briefly intercept a handful of them along the way, gathering information that will help generations of raptors to come. And perhaps most importantly, we experienced what stewardship and conservation can accomplish.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sky Migrations","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1581187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Max Lowe","original_name":"Max Lowe","popularity":0.1309,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6983f416eda1161c9e3632c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5987230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Post","original_name":"Charles Post","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6983f435f6faab061574a98f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4160822,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Forest Woodward","original_name":"Forest Woodward","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6983f44c723f9772b06e72f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7970316","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
