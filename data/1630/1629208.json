In 1963 and 1965 Lotus triumphed over BRM and Ferrari, with Clark winning the championship despite a strong challenge from Graham Hill, John Surtees, Jackie Stewart and Lorenzo Bandini, as well as Brabham and Gurney. Across the Atlantic a similar revolution was underway in Indy Car racing. Ford made its entrance at Indianapolis, where the Americans claimed a disputed win and Clark took the honours for Lotus at Milwaukee. In this compelling programme, the third volume in this exciting Lotus Story, we continue the full and fascinating history of one of Britain’s best-loved motor racing teams. We feature Clark’s battle against the surprising Brabham resurgence and the strengthening of the link between Lotus and Ford with the Mark 1 Lotus Cortina.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/efToJxnFyB1mu26Wr7HmrtgFSi6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duke Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Golden Years","title":"The Lotus Story Part 3 - The Golden Years","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gGwDEAqixCDdNQA64mDJwFSzStn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/efToJxnFyB1mu26Wr7HmrtgFSi6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":359471,"name":"formula 1"},{"id":367013,"name":"lotus racing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
