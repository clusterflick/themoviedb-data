It was a unique occasion seeing these two masters create art under the open sky once again. Through this rehearsal process, the documentary draws a vivid portrait of the Grange Theatre’s past and present, the community built around it, and the unique energy that binds Vojvodina Hungarian identity with the troupe’s history. The film is not merely a retrospective; it reveals how liberating and life-affirming theater-making can be, and how the joy of free creation remains indispensable today.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vLnUpOkyQbCu3RaFK3xx3cBr97I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184524,"logo_path":"/eVnQvFsAqzNGgxD7DpZgBGSfc4r.png","name":"Salamandra
