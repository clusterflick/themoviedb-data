Four people in different forms of relationships: two women, a man and a woman, two men. At the center is a frozen love, two open relationships at the edges—a triptych. Three pieces of music: opera arias for the side sections of the triptych, a jazz tango for the main section. On the left and right, a camera on a steadycam; in the middle, a revolving stage—a contact improvisation begins, danced variations on the possibilities of togetherness and disunity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Contakt Triptychon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1644046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Gregor","original_name":"Lutz Gregor","popularity":0.095,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6983516888f209b6a5e74c15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
