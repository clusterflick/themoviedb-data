Long, almost untouched beaches, very cold water, rain, few lucrative jobs, a fishing industry in decline, humor, a thick dialect, friendly people. An English region that is being abandoned. Four years ago, fishermen spotted a dolphin near the coast. It was early summer, salmon season. The dolphin found plenty of food and stayed. Children named him Freddie. He made the place famous, and Amble became a tourist destination. Northern England, 1991, a visit to Amble by the Sea above and below the water.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freddie der Delphin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2461072,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Barbara Metzlaff","original_name":"Barbara Metzlaff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69835111edb87fd5316210c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4191360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tillmann Scholl","original_name":"Tillmann Scholl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"698351168a64cc157dfa653f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
