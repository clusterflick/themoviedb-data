The film follows a group of hall-resident students who are deeply involved in campus politics. Through control over guest rooms, extortion, misuse of power, and blind loyalty to political leaders, they exercise power politics and dominate others. As the story unfolds, the movie shows how student politics often turns into a struggle for power, revealing the darker realities behind university life.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/2FSOm56xShK7INh52cwGslR6zaz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":142,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Political Satire","title":"The University of Chankharpul","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39394821","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.759,"height":843,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2FSOm56xShK7INh52cwGslR6zaz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
