Jiao Gong Band initially received attention from their efforts opposing the Meinong Dam project. After a brief pause in the Dam issue, Jiao Gong began following farm and farming issues, with their musical style quickly gaining increased popularity.  This film discusses the uneasy situation faced by Taiwan’s farm youth. The youth that sets out to the city seeking to develop themselves carry feelings of homesickness from leaving their farm and land; on returning to their hometown after the bubble economy, they continue to push the elder generation to leave the village. Aside from this, because of their difficult social status, farm youth can often only search for Southeast Asian “foreign brides” when seeking marriage. Within the film, new residents (新住民) discuss their feelings and mindset in moving to Taiwan and collaborate with Jiao Gong throughout the album’s recording process.","popularity":0.0481,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":97320,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taiwan Public Television Service Foundation","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"County Road 184","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2399774,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ho Chao-ti","original_name":"賀照緹","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602c0883d6d64d0040c90318","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2980541,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Chen Hsin-lung","original_name":"Chen Hsin-lung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602c20fde72fe8003e128bb7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2980539,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wang Hsing-chung","original_name":"Wang Hsing-chung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602c20e966469a003c27b7a6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2980539,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wang Hsing-chung","original_name":"Wang Hsing-chung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602c2156ae26be003e887050","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2980543,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Liu Huang-wen","original_name":"Liu Huang-wen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602c212cab5e3478449e6092","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2980544,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Li Ching-yun","original_name":"Li Ching-yun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602c219666469a003b27983f","department":"Crew","job":"Post Production Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2980538,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yuan Hung-shu","original_name":"Yuan Hung-shu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602c20d533ad8f004086200a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2399774,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ho Chao-ti","original_name":"賀照緹","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602c21ce90dde00041d40d19","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2980545,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tsuo Pei-hua","original_name":"左珮華","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602c21b85b370d00404477eb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2980537,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sylvia H.
