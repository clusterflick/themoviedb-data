The lightning itself fusions with its environment and creates a hypnotic point of view. The sound in the video was recorded on the occasion of the exceptionally high water alert in Venice, Italy. The alarm is composed of two parts. The first was the sirene in use under bombardments during WW2, whereas the second is designed by the University of Venice and should be heard during all the sleep phases, yet not causing any panic.  The images themselves were shot during multiple thunderstorms in the mountains between Lake Lugano and Lake Como. So, an interplay of salt and sweet water. Furthermore, the title TEMPORALLY is a combination of the Italian word for storm \"temporale\", and the word for atmospheric weather \"tempo\" which in English means rhythm and rally, thus a race of lightning, in the end, following in a recovery.","popularity":0.3336,"poster_path":"/o9BLZEwglc67qQiCjDNQyJdW80N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artoldo Pictures","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Temporally","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2275064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sara Ferro","original_name":"Sara Ferro","popularity":0.1772,"profile_path":"/oaBGP71OPeiPBkhpTnJtEThZj49.jpg","credit_id":"602d5c738ac3d0003fccea83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2275065,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Weil","original_name":"Chris Weil","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":"/2yzp3hSDQnFEDeZmYCjyCureOAl.jpg","credit_id":"602d5cc9a14bef004063576d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/helKGtCzxhe7u8hPx22UBPAvujg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/o9BLZEwglc67qQiCjDNQyJdW80N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":276847,"name":"moving images arts"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
