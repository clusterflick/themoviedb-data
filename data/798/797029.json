One day, the museum staff notice a rat in the boat’s hull and begin setting traps to catch the rodent before it damages this brilliant museum piece; however, as it turns out, the rat is not alone. In fact, there are surprisingly many of them. The staffs’ attempts to get rid of the rodents prove futile. And, because of its gentle Swedish upbringing, even the cat they bring in doesn’t help. They need to call in the experts – the Rescue Team!","popularity":0.1432,"poster_path":"/3zevIHIHUKcymuahrTireZj29nx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82672,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animācijas Brigāde","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2014-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vasa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1401880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jānis Cimmermanis","original_name":"Jānis Cimmermanis","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/78AVAJzNgQ0eiZvQuAeauiJTu9J.jpg","credit_id":"6029724328723c003ed2b022","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1401880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jānis Cimmermanis","original_name":"Jānis Cimmermanis","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/78AVAJzNgQ0eiZvQuAeauiJTu9J.jpg","credit_id":"6029724e511d09003e5951d6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1388050,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Māris Putniņš","original_name":"Māris Putniņš","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602972663396b9003cf3f569","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1388050,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Māris Putniņš","original_name":"Māris Putniņš","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602972743a48c5003f0ddc7d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1698481,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ēvalds Lācis","original_name":"Ēvalds Lācis","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/xic9sF27fNinhkF35uSIoUv5bap.jpg","credit_id":"6029728b417aaf0040091a6e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2820723,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Elvijs Menniks","original_name":"Elvijs Menniks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602972a40b5fd6003d8a190e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2820723,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Elvijs Menniks","original_name":"Elvijs Menniks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602972b25ab81a0040e5dfd0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1761346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mārtiņš Brauns","original_name":"Mārtiņš Brauns","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602972cc9603310040f71f77","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297711,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anrijs Krenbergs","original_name":"Anrijs Krenbergs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602972e3c7176d0040d5c202","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1388050,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Māris Putniņš","original_name":"Māris Putniņš","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602972fe9a358d003efed0f7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3509984","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":2819,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3zevIHIHUKcymuahrTireZj29nx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1921}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlinale - Generation KPlus","release_date":"2014-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Vasa\" director Jānis Cimmermanis","key":"563603355","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2021-06-16T09:11:16.000Z","id":"632660fadb154f007d3c76f8"}]}}}
