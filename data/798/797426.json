Identity is shaped and informed by the dominant culture, often producing stereotypes that are reinforced by the media. Through such structures racist behaviour is learned and condoned. So Are You uses unconventional structures and casting to criticize stereotypes. The eighteen cast members include Natives, Asians, Blacks and Whites. Paul Wong continues to explore the idea of self-identity by investigating gender boundaries through the inclusion of a set of identical male twins and two female impersonators who portray twins and two female impersonators who portray twins in the cast. The video uses recognizable television and cinematic framing devices to highlight the idea of the construction and dissemination of stereotypes through the broadcast news, cinema verite, interviews, etc. Comprised of short scenes, So Are You is faced paced and entertaining.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/brglumxV1xpAOM8x5L0WaKgccfm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103406,"logo_path":null,"name":"Video Out","origin_country":""},{"id":88516,"logo_path":null,"name":"VTape","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1995-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"So Are You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2979497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Wong","original_name":"Paul Wong","popularity":0.2315,"profile_path":"/nlwZppEVRRkjYk7XRZb1gwP5Wpr.jpg","credit_id":"60db7c3def9d72007e040eba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/brglumxV1xpAOM8x5L0WaKgccfm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
