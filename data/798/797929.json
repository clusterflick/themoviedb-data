The capture rate is set at one frame per second, though sound is recorded in real time. Focus, exposure, and effective shutter speed are allowed to float and respond eccentrically to changing light levels, focal distances, and color temperatures in ways that produce a free play between figuration and abstraction. However, despite the abstract, painterly, and conceptual character of these images, the work is meant to be understood as a document responding to specific landscapes, situations, movements, trajectories, and durations.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/wdsk0sO2Vl2KfjNk4c4Mlx0CuX6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waterloo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1938011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.
