And about East and West, muscle and mind power. About masters and students. A film full of paradoxes. Violence and its prevention are important themes in our society, and we are each involved in one way or the other. Aggression is bad, is the prevailing opinion. We, in the West, have begun to consider ourselves too civilized to fight. We fight with words and on the off chance that something does go wrong, a trauma team is at hand. Nevertheless, people continue to have a need to fight; take the violence during soccer matches. But in fact, we don't know how to handle aggression. In this film, several approaches to the martial arts in the West and the East are highlighted. The essence of the film is philosophical, but disguised as fight. Not as much a fight against an opponent but rather against oneself.","popularity":0.2989,"poster_path":"/9ABiGkYAglArwEGGIySdmT4JtGk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109985,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scarabee Filmproducties Nederland","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eat Your Enemy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2176534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eline Flipse","original_name":"Eline Flipse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602d75a255c1f4003e041927","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":227648,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hetty Naaijkens-Retel Helmrich","original_name":"Hetty Naaijkens-Retel Helmrich","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/sBGywRJ2udUwr5u4NaW9SpMaQEk.jpg","credit_id":"602d75ed770700003d6b1b48","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9ABiGkYAglArwEGGIySdmT4JtGk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":682}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":779,"name":"martial arts"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
