Then, she gave up everything for a \"beautiful marriage\". Now in her thirties, she is experiencing more and more difficulties in her life, which is both materially overprotected and difficult with her three children and an increasingly absent husband. She breaks down, cracks up and tries to imagine how she could broach the subject with her husband before it's too late. To her great amazement, it was Didier who, one evening before going to visit friends, announced that he was leaving and that he had already rented a small studio. After the shock, Rose goes to her father, an old Spanish anarchist, who gives her back the taste for values she thought she had lost.","popularity":0.2038,"poster_path":"/5P0twMowofDw5iLsBjap2hB7L75.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Osby Films","origin_country":""},{"id":11359,"logo_path":"/aqWJRi66t2oMPMmC60CdK9I3WQd.png","name":"France 2","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les femmes et les enfants d'abord","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Galiena","original_name":"Anna Galiena","popularity":0.6936,"profile_path":"/rJKizpOOVV0ZsdFss20wNqaS2NG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rose","credit_id":"602b8ce27e12f0003ef608fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Féodor Atkine","original_name":"Féodor Atkine","popularity":0.3421,"profile_path":"/qCpSPJyM7v9p3fGBJV8ZqGETBr0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Didier","credit_id":"602b8d0dab5e34003fa0bc34","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":32102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Ibáñez","original_name":"Roger Ibáñez","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/yOdYRDB1En326lHT6799vKyiRRH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pepe coquillage","credit_id":"602b8d35fea0d7003d2fd96c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Javier Albalá","original_name":"Javier Albalá","popularity":0.2378,"profile_path":"/p9vOw5Rpjftx5PtIsp31VOsNjzv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pedro","credit_id":"602b8d568258fc003d9dffe6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mapi Galán","original_name":"Mapi Galán","popularity":0.239,"profile_path":"/9F0Zj2ceDVln5sV29OUdf5niWoZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"602b8d8e8258fc003f9f23a4","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2344010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antoine Cousin-Mazure","original_name":"Antoine Cousin-Mazure","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Thibault","credit_id":"602b8dd67e12f00040f736ae","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2979859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heloise Labrande","original_name":"Heloise Labrande","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Marine","credit_id":"602b8e079d2b630040869ecc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2979861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mélisande Labrande","original_name":"Mélisande Labrande","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Thyphaine","credit_id":"602b8e5390dde0003fd26444","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543364,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascal Aubier","original_name":"Pascal Aubier","popularity":0.2661,"profile_path":"/dIfXWo2CBe0EIm5OSCLTHDYrQ27.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Max","credit_id":"602b8e7d7e12f0003ff641e8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1204336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulo Filipe","original_name":"Paulo Filipe","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/iD22iIfDrdtn7ddllJRmNBgWQlB.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6086b954532acb0077eeb02c","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050968,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sandra Joxe","original_name":"Sandra Joxe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602b8e9dc04429003edbc8e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050968,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sandra Joxe","original_name":"Sandra Joxe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602b8eae9a9e20003c368479","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0205059","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/5P0twMowofDw5iLsBjap2hB7L75.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Diffusion sur France 2","release_date":"1994-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
