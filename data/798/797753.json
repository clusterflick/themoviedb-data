Rather than taking the making-of approach, Ninki Nanka, The Prince of Colobane used the filming of Mambéty’s movie, which he wrote, directed, and acted in, as a pretext to examine his character. Following him throughout the shoot and also paying visits to his family and childhood friends, Laurence Gavron set off on a quest to find the real Djibril—actor, author, filmmaker, brilliant poet, rogue and clairvoyant, charmer with a big heart—in order to expose the different facets of this generous, creative, and fiercely committed vagabond spirit.","popularity":0.0666,"poster_path":"/4Edzez7NdwEkAYTXHOOPRbgAAG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":223350,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eldorado Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Wolof","iso_639_1":"wo","name":"Wolof"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ninki Nanka, The Prince of Colobane","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079380,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Djibril Diop Mambéty","original_name":"Djibril Diop Mambéty","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":"/qP0a19xyKBoAY22ZsnJJy9Okfm6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"602c86e9d4b9d9003fd151d8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurence Gavron","original_name":"Laurence Gavron","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f1a399470ead017e9d4836","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1596856,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ndiouga Moctar Bâ","original_name":"Ndiouga Moctar Bâ","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f1a3042fdec6017020ffc6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3619554,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bara Diokhane","original_name":"Bara Diokhane","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f1a2edfbe36f0185ef1495","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Variety Moszynski","original_name":"Variety Moszynski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f1a315470ead01629c4e03","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurence Gavron","original_name":"Laurence Gavron","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602c86d144ea540040d40f8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4Edzez7NdwEkAYTXHOOPRbgAAG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1068}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
