Twenty two years later, forty eight year old Martin Bryant, the man convicted of the crime, rots away in prison, never to be released. But many unanswered questions remain surrounding the massacre. Did he act alone? Was justice really served and was he guilty beyond reasonable doubt? WASP will rip away the silence that surrounds that black day in Australia's history, delving into the people, the places and the crime that changed a nation forever.","popularity":0.4058,"poster_path":"/iEpdQ5HeMfsETlSXqZJ6cCIEAtZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149435,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hybrid Films","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Wasp: The Port Arthur Massacre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"The port Arthur massacre","type":"Subtitle"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Moder","original_name":"Paul Moder","popularity":0.1349,"profile_path":"/gByftbxalQBSK0QCSVgeXee2Fqg.jpg","credit_id":"602be8f6e72fe8003b10d72e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Moder","original_name":"Paul Moder","popularity":0.1349,"profile_path":"/gByftbxalQBSK0QCSVgeXee2Fqg.jpg","credit_id":"602be90d9d2b63004187f54c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491535,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Walker","original_name":"Brian Walker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602beb728d22fc0040df0777","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491535,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Walker","original_name":"Brian Walker","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602bebd38d22fc0040df081b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5323172","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"bryantthemovie","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1628,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iEpdQ5HeMfsETlSXqZJ6cCIEAtZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1148}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276784,"name":"port arthur"},{"id":276816,"name":"martin bryant"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Wasp - The Port Arthur Massacre trailer","key":"gRsJJsrSOhY","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-06-12T05:43:09.000Z","id":"602bea779d2b63004187f953"}]}}}
