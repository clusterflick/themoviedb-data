Ben, a freelance wedding photographer, suddenly finds himself a single parent of three young boys. After adapting to his new situation, Ben finds himself an innocent victim of the system and struggles through a roller coaster of emotions as he fights for his rights against an irrational, faceless organization, desperately trying to provide a home for his children against all the odds. Following enormous public protests, the Child Support Agency was axed in 1996 and replaced with a revised system, which is still controversial today.","popularity":0.0934,"poster_path":"/1UYo0yoPYwJwcHw9fcCjCkdrhtQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172868,"logo_path":null,"name":"BBTV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father's Daze","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Father's Daze","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4399371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxwell Whitelock","original_name":"Maxwell Whitelock","popularity":0.1099,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Scott","credit_id":"67853a720690ac06e77b83d6","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11460372","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1UYo0yoPYwJwcHw9fcCjCkdrhtQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
