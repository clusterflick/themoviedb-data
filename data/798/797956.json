All movement in this film has been eliminated or neutralized in order to intensify the impact of changing color systems. The evolutionary process of these color systems is created with the basic cinematic technique of fading-in and fading-out. The geometry of Brain Field, as a result, is static and consists of color-activated nonrelational forms. Varying envelopes of space are created throughout Brain Field by orchestrating the attack and decay of color sensations. By using this minimal approach to film, it was my aim to create temporal color activity that is real, self-evident, and devoid of subject matter or secondary associations.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brain Field","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1539695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Russett","original_name":"Robert Russett","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602d62f7e86017003fff8479","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
