When the film starts the Soviet Union has fallen and Latvia is now an independant state. The women are pretty much left to fend for them selves and their children. They describe their lives as divorced and single mothers in a time of social, political and economic crisis. It is a film about broken relationships between men and women, between generations and a society in shambles.","popularity":0.1262,"poster_path":"/p1hQhA7NyZBMFypK66HXlNmcjVb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75283,"logo_path":null,"name":"Little Big Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girls of 1960","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Flickor födda 1960","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1105422,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Una Celma","original_name":"Una Celma","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/wyoj50Clvti1zhwJMZEehgB9jEP.jpg","credit_id":"602d09090f3655004025df73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1761346,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mārtiņš Brauns","original_name":"Mārtiņš Brauns","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602d091a223e20003f969d70","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1686857,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna G.
