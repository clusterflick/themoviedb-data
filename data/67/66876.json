Although referee \"Clean Game\" Kinney does his best to supervise, the hockey game really gets out of hand eventually. Two star players, Bertino and Ferguson, are so anxious, they never get let out of the penalty box, referee Kinney is never able to drop the puck without being physically hurt somehow, and the spectators themselves are so worked into the game, they take out their aggression on the ice while the players relax in the bleachers.","popularity":0.6692,"poster_path":"/f0P2oPEI2vyeWE4p5G9g6V61pwF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hockey Homicide","video":false,"vote_average":6.957,"vote_count":35,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Homicidio en el hockey","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Partita al massacro","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Jan Långben på hal is","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doodles Weaver","original_name":"Doodles Weaver","popularity":0.5522,"profile_path":"/wHqmjRk0737jHfrVzudsOLavp3F.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"569ec76cc3a36858c8007684","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pinto Colvig","original_name":"Pinto Colvig","popularity":0.3687,"profile_path":"/jslBLHuV1cOKsyx763CA1RqsrQU.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Goofy (voice)","credit_id":"569ec8d0c3a36858c80076af","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Kinney","original_name":"Jack Kinney","popularity":0.3626,"profile_path":"/4wFzg3PdcrB1wPnCl5sj4KuS2Mk.jpg","credit_id":"52fe474ec3a368484e0bfab5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"569ec77c9251415e5e007bc0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148253,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jack Boyd","original_name":"Jack Boyd","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569ec7939251415e5e007bc5","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":149976,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"John Sibley","original_name":"John Sibley","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569ec79ec3a36858c800768b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143787,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Hal King","original_name":"Hal King","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569ec7ab925141095800410d","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138170,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Milt Kahl","original_name":"Milt Kahl","popularity":0.118,"profile_path":"/3Kh10dBqHTNDbXmsEoD7GAISelz.jpg","credit_id":"569ec7c8c3a36858c8007690","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150737,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Art Riley","original_name":"Art Riley","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569ec7eb925141370b000213","department":"Art","job":"Background Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don DaGradi","original_name":"Don DaGradi","popularity":0.2795,"profile_path":"/1ZLdNjZqJtxCkEfEg9Z9AyzSuDV.jpg","credit_id":"569ec83ac3a36858cb007148","department":"Directing","job":"Layout"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148073,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bill Berg","original_name":"Bill Berg","popularity":0.1492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569ec84b9251413849000222","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115757,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dick Kinney","original_name":"Dick Kinney","popularity":0.1633,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"569ec8579251415e67007bd4","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2107,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul J.
