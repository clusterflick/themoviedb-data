Aware that sharing this information with the coach might get his friends kicked off the team and ultimately cost the school the state championship, Tyler must choose what's more important: winning or doing what's right. As these events unfold, the camera also reveals more surprising footage to Tyler's kid sister Lucy. She learns that Cory has a secret past, unknown even to him. Now Lucy must convince her mom (Faith Ford, Murphy Brown) and family that the camera's revealing insight is not a product of her imagination as she enlists their help to find the answers Cory so desperately needs. It's a compelling and intriguing story that shows both the challenges and rewards of doing the right thing even when it's tough to do.","popularity":1.0875,"poster_path":"/oJ8mc6cSgQfzDti9k8mGpsKdSlq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63813,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rosemont Productions International","origin_country":"US"},{"id":22367,"logo_path":"/pbkAbvOROqyZOcWgGvTsiryrUfW.png","name":"Procter & Gamble Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes being a leader is tougher than winning","title":"Field of Vision","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"L.
