Yet after a race, he tests positive for illegal substances and is subsequently suspended from racing. He decides to move to Macau, in Asia. There his circumstances change very quickly: he wins one race after another, earning himself large amounts of money and success with women. But, his new life also brings him an ever-increasing sense of solitude. Macau has its own unspoken rules that Christophe thinks he can ignore. But events start to gain momentum as the net tightens around him. Motivated by love for an intriguing young Chinese woman, Christophe ends up gambling with his own destiny, but this time on the card tables.","popularity":0.5183,"poster_path":"/oucwxVcEo9mO9owjO7ml0czGRtR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6274,"logo_path":"/ngZoa368SAnERTz3IBvgTT4eWeB.png","name":"MK2 Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stretch","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":64439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fan Bingbing","original_name":"范冰冰","popularity":7.7406,"profile_path":"/pV2wYJiiPd6cgHK580PKD0GM4Dc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pansy","credit_id":"52fe4728c3a368484e0b800f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Carradine","original_name":"David Carradine","popularity":1.5154,"profile_path":"/1X2GlkMKS9FIG1kGou7o6LRqAjz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Monteiro","credit_id":"52fe4728c3a368484e0b8013","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Duvauchelle","original_name":"Nicolas Duvauchelle","popularity":0.4586,"profile_path":"/nQsvg9syyFY112gi9TC56xIKhRI.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Thierry","credit_id":"52fe4728c3a368484e0b8017","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Cazalé","original_name":"Nicolas Cazalé","popularity":0.2613,"profile_path":"/a1NyEPcJb5BR5l7tHutLP68Jn5D.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Christophe","credit_id":"52fe4728c3a368484e0b800b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2849035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cédric Segeon","original_name":"Cédric Segeon","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5fa8d8b25346610041ea8e99","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1814500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Frenay","original_name":"Simon Frenay","popularity":0.1093,"profile_path":"/xl3ruazrF2OBo7S5h7puE0ygH5q.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5fa8d8bd21621d003dfa591d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238973,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lowell Lo Koon-Ting","original_name":"Lowell Lo Koon-Ting","popularity":0.2396,"profile_path":"/wrBsg1D6KCxwtBQWWhVXvpp3Jf3.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"66cc2f7074a72352340f9f2b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":856126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Teo","original_name":"Pete Teo","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":"/7bJutZz5qd2rYBHHC2gyMQWNQbu.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"66cc2f76445b393ad93d29d3","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69761,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles de Meaux","original_name":"Charles de Meaux","popularity":0.1094,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4728c3a368484e0b8001","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69761,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles de Meaux","original_name":"Charles de Meaux","popularity":0.1094,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4728c3a368484e0b8007","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1455244","wikidata_id":"Q3500376","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.764,"height":1744,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/oucwxVcEo9mO9owjO7ml0czGRtR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1332},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eoMVrQV1foM1dFqrOPmhDizkFM3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
