The park's ranger, J. Audubon Woodlore, asks the bears to participate with the tourists but...no stealing! Humphrey decides to pair with Donald particularly because of the roast ham he has. When Donald doesn't reward the bear with his food, Humphrey tries a variety of means to get the ham finally getting Donald's attention by lying down on the road pretending that Donald ran over him. After Donald pays up with food, he sees through the scheme and struggles with Humphrey. After the ranger makes Donald and Humphrey clean up the resulting mess, he too notices the ham and makes off with it but is scolded for it by Donald and Humphrey.","popularity":0.7112,"poster_path":"/cmJXPfspP2ibJRqeY8fQJnrF0FP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1954-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grin and Bear It","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":19,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Sorridi e sopportalo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James MacDonald","original_name":"James MacDonald","popularity":0.3863,"profile_path":"/qf3IMvOrc39jKz6Bddtv4Ur2ski.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Humphrey the Bear (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe474ec3a368484e0bfa8b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Nash","original_name":"Clarence Nash","popularity":0.467,"profile_path":"/x2g2hbu4RRIcn6Q5RT8gpWR1FKV.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Donald Duck (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe474ec3a368484e0bfa8f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Thompson","original_name":"Bill Thompson","popularity":0.563,"profile_path":"/4l8jV6jZ9k06B62MH1rdtCho3Ag.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Ranger J.
