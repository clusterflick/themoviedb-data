They could travel to Marseilles and attempt to get the servile but still nominally independent government of Vichy France to grant them an exit visa. Then they could take passage to safer climes on one of the neutral vessels that stopped there. This drama, based on a novel by Anna Seghers, follows the fates of a small group of desperate people who are attempting to do just that.","popularity":0.2654,"poster_path":"/gUQ4vftndCFBwHjm4eNSoZZiJ2d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1991-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transit","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Koch","original_name":"Sebastian Koch","popularity":0.4597,"profile_path":"/4YFk0qauux4jn68mvIfd5EEtG2v.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Gerhardt","credit_id":"52fe4741c3a368484e0bd1ab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":545024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Messner","original_name":"Claudia Messner","popularity":0.4579,"profile_path":"/9g5EeUc5aTTcnktckzEjVa9wFWk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marie","credit_id":"52fe4741c3a368484e0bd1af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rüdiger Vogler","original_name":"Rüdiger Vogler","popularity":0.2712,"profile_path":"/bW9FkPAZ1HnzxmlLsXNIgOyTQ0O.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Doctor","credit_id":"52fe4741c3a368484e0bd1b3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":545025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magali Leiris","original_name":"Magali Leiris","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nadine","credit_id":"52fe4741c3a368484e0bd1b7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":236632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Allio","original_name":"Paul Allio","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Georges Binnet","credit_id":"679964bbf82d6da2b92795f3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":136169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Dogué","original_name":"Nicole Dogué","popularity":0.0827,"profile_path":"/uLTV3ZuFhFnhLDw0umsM0KTXruI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Claudine","credit_id":"679964cbb4b6f91453a96637","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238378,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"René Allio","original_name":"René Allio","popularity":0.1154,"profile_path":"/taRBvxBhasnBYJOxBPeLk5VMqO7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4741c3a368484e0bd1a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1159976,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anna Seghers","original_name":"Anna Seghers","popularity":0.1,"profile_path":"/wjz6J1550K3BMhiNDR24gM3Y16G.jpg","credit_id":"5a1e706c0e0a264cbc079a51","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56244,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Copans","original_name":"Richard Copans","popularity":0.1466,"profile_path":"/c6zkFdzQW6mQdYDMTdUVO1BVC2k.jpg","credit_id":"67996522f2ff0dde55c0c114","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1161035,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marie-Hélène Quinton","original_name":"Marie-Hélène Quinton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"679965cca3fef657cda9667b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0103118","wikidata_id":"Q3537630","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gUQ4vftndCFBwHjm4eNSoZZiJ2d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
