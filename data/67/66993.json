He immediately decides to get another one but he shows poor judgement in regards that the one he picks is unkowingly the home of a mountain lion. The lion returns to Goofy's penthouse to reclaim his tree, notices the hammock, and decides this is a much better source of relaxation than laying on a tree branch. Thus, he tries to remove Goofy from the hammock so he can relax himself and eventually a battle ensues.","popularity":0.8377,"poster_path":"/swSOzBicz7P1ECXcQqldNIVHyAV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lion Down","video":false,"vote_average":6.371,"vote_count":31,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Dingo et le lion","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pinto Colvig","original_name":"Pinto Colvig","popularity":0.3687,"profile_path":"/jslBLHuV1cOKsyx763CA1RqsrQU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Goofy (voice)","credit_id":"564fb969c3a3680712005214","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James MacDonald","original_name":"James MacDonald","popularity":0.3863,"profile_path":"/qf3IMvOrc39jKz6Bddtv4Ur2ski.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Louie (voice)","credit_id":"654278eae1ad79012c90bb9b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Kinney","original_name":"Jack Kinney","popularity":0.3626,"profile_path":"/4wFzg3PdcrB1wPnCl5sj4KuS2Mk.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4753c3a368484e0c0e05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"6524271cfd63000139e4be50","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":149217,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Merle Cox","original_name":"Merle Cox","popularity":0.0522,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"564fbabcc3a36833e7001106","department":"Art","job":"Background Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115757,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dick Kinney","original_name":"Dick Kinney","popularity":0.1633,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"564fbad0c3a368070a005185","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148161,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Milt Schaffer","original_name":"Milt Schaffer","popularity":0.121,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"564fbade9251414b07005434","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0043745","wikidata_id":"Q3028331","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6WTXWP4t0wl39VktTEuXNmeARO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":912,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/swSOzBicz7P1ECXcQqldNIVHyAV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6hJxolxQtkgeypozn0YtiLHL8oa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gcbRWOWiUQDM3J47WUBw8ueipWY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3py3HeYvqG70FM3RlJJAiB4azqD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3352,"name":"tree"},{"id":2043,"name":"lion"},{"id":4504,"name":"penthouse apartment"},{"id":11477,"name":"anthropomorphism"},{"id":15162,"name":"dog"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
