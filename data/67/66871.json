The collection is filled with poignantly fascinating moments, such as when an aging American veteran revisits the Omaha Beach he stormed on D-Day, and meets the elderly German who, as a teenager, was defending that section of the beach with his machine gun, or footage of Hitler's early political speeches, raging promises of things to come.","popularity":0.0704,"poster_path":"/ltRA1kCua9thG1C8OOcZf3Eu4rO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1800,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"History of World War II","title":"BBC History of World War II","video":true,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ltRA1kCua9thG1C8OOcZf3Eu4rO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
