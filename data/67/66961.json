In the first waltz (music based on Johann Strauss I), Yvonne is a sensitive Parisian ballet dancer, whose romance with a dashing officer is brought to an abrupt end by his family. She goes off to Vienna to become a big star. In the second waltz, her daughter, an even bigger star, but now of Paris music halls, has a brief flirtation with the rakish man-about-town who is the son of suitor number one. She throws him over pretty quickly for a chance to shine at a Gala performance. Finally, in the third waltz, the two get together, when she is a movie star, and he is posing as an insurance salesman.","popularity":0.3142,"poster_path":"/56kydZ1kTaWad5mYlCHaRODz8Bb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1938-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Waltzes","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":545673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne Printemps","original_name":"Yvonne Printemps","popularity":0.1883,"profile_path":"/aejQCgZucI9564RiJ4Jlv33uX4Y.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Fanny, Yvette et Irène Grandpré","credit_id":"52fe4752c3a368484e0c085b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Fresnay","original_name":"Pierre Fresnay","popularity":0.1462,"profile_path":"/kHa9UH2jlarWBkpyFSe5n1RsM8u.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Octave, Philippe et Gérard de Chalencey","credit_id":"52fe4752c3a368484e0c085f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Guisol","original_name":"Henri Guisol","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/wwribZzEw28HRao7imqkFcgl5qZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Brunner fils","credit_id":"52fe4752c3a368484e0c0863","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Périer","original_name":"Jean Périer","popularity":0.1286,"profile_path":"/gbGLT2nvUrGOL8txY6RRDH5iqu0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Le président Lebrun","credit_id":"52fe4752c3a368484e0c0867","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1688092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Stéphen","original_name":"Pierre Stéphen","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1a158a66a0d300121126b3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2745871,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Dorane","original_name":"Jean Dorane","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Un Groom (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f3af7f77e12f00032cf43d4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Vattier","original_name":"Robert Vattier","popularity":0.0966,"profile_path":"/40m5BRxxTAGTybya37eaxUvhPey.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"61f9feb759e8a900c3a992fa","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":589568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Helbling","original_name":"Jeanne Helbling","popularity":0.0539,"profile_path":"/qExFhSSvD53lc4OcAQq2V74dkZ4.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"61f9febcae6f09011578a908","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1341970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Maxudian","original_name":"Max Maxudian","popularity":0.0968,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"61f9fec70c4c16009ba836a3","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":593153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Cahuzac","original_name":"Georges Cahuzac","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"61f9fecc68929c0122a21c02","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolf E.
