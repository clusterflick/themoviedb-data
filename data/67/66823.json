They are also big party animals. Honorine, Bobby's aunt, is outraged by her nephew's bad behavior, all the more as it is with her money that the young man paints the city red, always accompanied by Pat. She then decides to send them both to the West Indies, where she owns a sugar-cane plantation, in the hope that far from temptation they will reform. Once there, the two revelers come up with nothing better than - swap identities, which will be the cause of a series of cheerful misunderstandings. Everything will end not in one, but several marriages.","popularity":0.2552,"poster_path":"/siup9pNe93MEpAPQeoJUFt7yvrQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1936-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toi,
