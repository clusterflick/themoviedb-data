In 1984, Byrne and filmmaker Jonathan Demme redefined the boundaries of the concert film with the Talking Heads documentary STOP MAKING SENSE, and more than 25 years later Byrne has teamed up with David Hillman to create RIDE, RISE, ROAR, which documents Byrne's 2008-2009 concert tour, in which he performs new material written in collaboration with Brian Eno as well as favorites from his solo career as well as his tenure in Talking Heads. Using costumes and inventive choreography, Byrne and his musicians and dancers give his music a stage presentation as exciting as the music.","popularity":0.3054,"poster_path":"/wr7SqA0SMNFGrNZ6BqKIcUxZ9Ex.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ride, Rise, Roar","video":false,"vote_average":7.714,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"David Byrne - Ride, Rise, Roar","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3078,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Byrne","original_name":"David Byrne","popularity":0.5258,"profile_path":"/iyD9S1hvyWjtiAedZAACDcWKuaf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"54eed83fc3a368402d002d79","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37317,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Eno","original_name":"Brian Eno","popularity":0.3595,"profile_path":"/lLdYPTiwg5uvFFSY70TI3CCJYE4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"628a4e847d5db51b2a9f1c1a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1069162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lily Baldwin","original_name":"Lily Baldwin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vh6xa2RVKNGFAUNAnqxNZKuP8jS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe472bc3a368484e0b8877","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1069163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Layla Childs","original_name":"Layla Childs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe472bc3a368484e0b887f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1068008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hillman Curtis","original_name":"Hillman Curtis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe472bc3a368484e0b8873","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1341795","wikidata_id":"Q7332466","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nQllzZf2iZ5G39xX8F6YjGMS03P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1924},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qSPeXtKqk8YJVm1zWTlRBO6jNjH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1526,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wr7SqA0SMNFGrNZ6BqKIcUxZ9Ex.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1017},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1170,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eC9RH1GUNkhemBMYuejN7hnciZl.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mar del Plata Film Festival","release_date":"2010-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"South by Southwest Film Festival","release_date":"2010-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ride, Rise, Roar Trailer.mp4","key":"8AkoD_rB2Dk","published_at":"2010-10-26T23:15:31.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6bcc3a3685448006832"}]}}}
