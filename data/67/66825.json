Not only did he not have any idea that this dramatic act was a possibility, neither did his other friends. Perhaps it had something to do with his having an unrequited love for a beautiful young neighbor, an attraction Ismaël also feels. Perhaps it had something to do with drugs, or a problem with a universally disliked teacher. Throughout most of the film, the young survivors discuss their departed classmate.","popularity":0.2299,"poster_path":"/mSOfbCX1ZIQ6gAuA33tnAYR1And.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":635,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Alain
