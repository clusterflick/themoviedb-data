Every image is marked and cancelled before it disappears. Even the emulsion of the film is treated with acid showing its fragility. The film is a highly effective compilation of image, colour and sound building upon each other, slowly heightening the sense of urgency.  Against this mood there is a reassuring image of a silhouetted woman working at the film projector. A strong, competent, fearless woman. Woman documenting, warning, saving.","popularity":0.0327,"poster_path":"/2CuFxCkPH1HnFsyFDIkjjIXqVzy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endangered","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","credit_id":"58adf64092514160f4000e85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0140988","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2CuFxCkPH1HnFsyFDIkjjIXqVzy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
