But over the past 25 years, their heated competition has steadily grown in intensity, with Duke and North Carolina gearing up each season to reach a common goal: to beat their archrival twice in the regular season, regardless of rankings or won-loss records.  These two Atlantic Coast Conference powerhouses frequently dominate the conference standings, and routinely compete for the top spot in the national polls. Remarkably, since the NCAA Tournament expanded to its current configuration in 1985, these two schools alone have combined for more national titles (five) and made more Final Four appearances (18), than any other entire conference.","popularity":0.2463,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6751,"logo_path":"/giPzzhPdiNloiuwo7qLagRn5uGH.png","name":"HBO Sports","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two rival powerhouses. 8 miles apart.","title":"Battle for Tobacco Road: Duke vs. Carolina","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liev Schreiber","original_name":"Liev Schreiber","popularity":2.5942,"profile_path":"/gTHvDnTN52iTdnQPVPu6LhirUHc.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"58bc5ee2c3a368664d03f3db","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112028,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Roy","original_name":"George Roy","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58bc5f2dc3a368663003b5cd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112025,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Erik Kesten","original_name":"Erik Kesten","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58bc5ef692514160730408a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112028,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Roy","original_name":"George Roy","popularity":0.0887,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58bc5f23c3a368666b03a5ff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1514261","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
