However powerful big shot Captain Innocencio (a misnomer indeed!)is, he proves unable to charm Lolita, the shapely daughter of his neighbor, a big-time rancher. Lolita expects better than this awkward unprepossessing showoff! Besides the fortune-teller she consults tells her her true love will get into her life after a terrible storm. This very night a violent storm does break out and an American pilot, whose plane is caught in it, is forced to make an emergency landing next to where she lives. The gringo - by the name of Phil Marvin - is both dashing and good-looking. Good news for Lolita but bad news for Innocencio who is not ready to bow that easily...","popularity":0.7318,"poster_path":"/d86R8HYTPQn5y4UKPcM491XJccR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"OUT OF THE CLOUDS HE CAME TO \"STEAL\" A REBEL'S SWEETHEART","title":"The Broken Wing","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lupe Vélez","original_name":"Lupe Vélez","popularity":0.2776,"profile_path":"/kQijKJyxUGZJwm6owDFEWfjmzT9.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Lolita","credit_id":"58b32136c3a36852540096d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Carrillo","original_name":"Leo Carrillo","popularity":0.1883,"profile_path":"/2vnSRTNNUcaay4PcnOTCqDCwjqf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Capt.
