Space travel, astrology, spirals, the universe, catastrophe and madness are recurring visual and narrative themes in this expressionistic theater. \"Of course we're all a little scared of the dark,\" says Oursler in his dreamlike narration. Rendered with his signature hand-painted sets and wildly constructed props, Spinout features a voiceover text by Oursler that is metaphorical as well as psychological, universal as well as personal.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spinout","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Oursler","original_name":"Tony Oursler","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":"/lcn8zD8Z6rSYQ8Owo6IYvZWvWuV.jpg","credit_id":"58b2c1c692514177f6002ec5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
