Through an examination of the emotional and cultural links between the women of one family, the processes of the construction of memory and the re-construction of history, are revealed. Utilizing an innovative combination of experimental, dramatic and documentary forms, the film emerges as a deeply moving and compassionate love letter. Just as the official history of the Japanese Canadians has been thrown into question, so does the film’s fictionalized narrative, question documentary as truth.","popularity":0.0749,"poster_path":"/BweOjlDlOpuutDjvNKhgJfqqOF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Displaced View","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1762801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suno Yamazaki","original_name":"Suno Yamazaki","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"58ac5541c3a36849cc013905","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1762803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Onodera","original_name":"Martha Onodera","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"58ac5548c3a36849f6012094","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1762804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matsuye Mori","original_name":"Matsuye Mori","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"58ac55509251415900014f87","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1360907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Midi Onodera","original_name":"Midi Onodera","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/uzmvxdgeTp0wU7Qasw4WZhWfZjL.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"58ac555792514158c001506a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1360907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Midi Onodera","original_name":"Midi Onodera","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/uzmvxdgeTp0wU7Qasw4WZhWfZjL.jpg","credit_id":"58ac54fc9251415900014f4c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1600311,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean Young","original_name":"Jean Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ac550cc3a36849fe01450b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":962587,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adam Swica","original_name":"Adam Swica","popularity":0.1691,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ac552692514158c8014368","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1762798,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michaelle McLean","original_name":"Michaelle McLean","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ac551a9251415900014f5e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1762800,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sarah Peddie","original_name":"Sarah Peddie","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ac553292514158c4014c51","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1360907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Midi Onodera","original_name":"Midi Onodera","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/uzmvxdgeTp0wU7Qasw4WZhWfZjL.jpg","credit_id":"58ac54e792514158c4014c2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1360907,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Midi Onodera","original_name":"Midi Onodera","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/uzmvxdgeTp0wU7Qasw4WZhWfZjL.jpg","credit_id":"58ac54f192514158c4014c33","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0095034","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/BweOjlDlOpuutDjvNKhgJfqqOF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11800,"name":"mockumentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
