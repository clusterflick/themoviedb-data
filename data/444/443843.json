Over 2000 monks live on Athos - cut off from the outside world. Access is denied to women, tourists are not welcome. Only workers and pilgrims can obtain a visa. The \"Autonomous Monastic State of the Holy Mountain\" attracts people who feel like they are missing something from their modern lives. With the help of three Athos monks, \"Athos - A Taste of Heaven\" tells the story of the island and its inhabitants in a unique filmed diary style. The film's guiding theme is the path we as people have to find and follow - each and everyone for themselves. \"First we must heal our own souls, only then we can help others\", is one of Father Galaktions core messages. He lives as a hermit on the holy mountain. Not all monks, however, live as secluded and demure as Father Galaktion. The film team is also received by Father Epiphanios - a gifted and poetic cook who certainly does not disdain the pleasures of life.","popularity":0.8055,"poster_path":"/jRwev7xhpQHzEjfWApJ4Wwtl4xR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88098,"logo_path":"/gtQtufT5tFzRdwijKwmQGOHWBzi.png","name":"Vidicom
