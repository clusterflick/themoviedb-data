After twenty years with Parkinson's, Larry attempts to ride 300 miles across his state of South Dakota with the support of his family and community to show the power of keeping your body active and mind positive, proving that the best cure is living life to its fullest. The film follows Larry as attempts to push his limits and expand the boundary of possibilities for those with Parkinson's. Weaved amongst his journey is an intimate portrait of Parkinson's, illuminating the day-to-day fight of those diagnosed, their families, and caretakers. It is a film for all those stigmatized or mired in the darkness of illnesses without cures. Larry and his wife Betty refuse to be defined by this diagnosis, proving that sometimes the best cure is living life to its fullest.","popularity":0.1348,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ride with Larry","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4329743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Smith","original_name":"Larry Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65321594efe37c00e42d28ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1763375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Alberts","original_name":"Jay Alberts","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58acdd37c3a3682a7a00186e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1763376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Drabant","original_name":"Emily Drabant","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58acdd4ac3a3682b050017b9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":65319,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Betsy Stahl","original_name":"Betsy Stahl","popularity":0.0549,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62b2296054f6eb0062fe52fe","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1763374,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ricardo Villarreal","original_name":"Ricardo Villarreal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58acdd049251411f97001b66","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1763373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Rubin","original_name":"Andrew Rubin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58acdcf59251411f84001af0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2386281","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-12-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ride with Larry - Official Trailer","key":"HQTFPoEtQD8","published_at":"2013-11-12T23:21:59.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"58acdcb4c3a3682ae6001870"}]}}}
