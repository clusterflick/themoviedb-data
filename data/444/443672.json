He recites a bit of doggerel about the current popularity of mystery plays (\"full of thrills and sighing moans, slamming doors and ringing phones\") and then slinks away. Eerie music, thunder, and sinister lighting set the scene. Vivien enters, frightened, and then John, ditto. They tiptoe about, and exchange ridiculous quips about how terrible it all is. Young staggers in, groaning, and slumps into a chair. Vivien screams, and dashes away. When John bumps into the corpse and excuses himself, the corpse comes to life long enough to say \"That's all right\" before falling dead again.","popularity":0.1403,"poster_path":"/2Yp3fw2BLaLp69fWJlUsRPdN7hn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/zhD3hhtKB5qyv7ZeL4uLpNxgMVU.png","name":"Warner Bros.
