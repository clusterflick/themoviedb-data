Filmed over the course of 1 day from sunup to sundown.  Constraint:\r Each individual shot in the iPhone cut (filmed and edited one month prior) was timed and each location mapped. Because the film was edited sequentially in-camera, physical movement through space was required in mimicking the cuts of the digital version - an unfolding of montage in real environments. The iPhone movie was constructed so as to form a map, the 16mm film is the traversing of the points plotted. Periodic shots of empty skies mark the passage of time through color.  The filmâ€™s digital counterpart has been deleted.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/sUee5cZebF50zG39jjXGrizWYqe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vigil, Split","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1763033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isaac Goes","original_name":"Isaac Goes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58ac840892514158c8015e2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sUee5cZebF50zG39jjXGrizWYqe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Vigil, Split","key":"9w8fhpRe5Is","published_at":"2017-02-06T16:11:49.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"58ac846d92514158c0016c96"}]}}}
