Washington is remembered as America's founding father, Arnold as America's most notorious traitor. Benedict Arnold rose from humble origins to become the most respected and feared of America's generals. He won brilliant military victories against the English colonists and was Washington's favorite soldier. But two conflicting forces battled inside Arnold's heart; a deep concern for his country and his passionate love for an enchanting and manipulative English woman, Peggy Shippen. Blinded by desire, Arnold defected to the English army, orchestrating an attempt to assassinate his own mentor, George Washington.","popularity":1.9292,"poster_path":"/bfVJXZvD7gNuCR0jgMZnrl0BqcY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18441,"logo_path":"/rJmXT9sgCKG8uSUO1T93kOTfAzm.png","name":"A+E Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2003-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Benedict Arnold: A Question of Honor","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Field of Honour","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aidan Quinn","original_name":"Aidan Quinn","popularity":1.3572,"profile_path":"/viUuUmhiGdsfoQh0IpO5N312qNd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gen.
