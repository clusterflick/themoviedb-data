Her husband, Ramón, wants more of her attention; her feelings are mixed, wanting domestic peace, feeling responsibilities to the revolution, and wanting to control her own life beyond doing dirty dishes. They separate; he begins an affair. When he wants a reconciliation, she asks what his response would be if she'd had an affair too. \"But men are different,\" is his reply. He's failed her test, and to hold on to independence and self-respect, she remains uncompromising and hard-edged.","popularity":0.1683,"poster_path":"/hGbFBuC1U1mHhpMn1tSxqB347SU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5175,"logo_path":"/sEc4VmMYh1G09ySm8ThZ5S3gcUS.png","name":"ICAIC","origin_country":"CU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"1979-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrait of Teresa","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","title":"Retrato de Teresa","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":228996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daisy Granados","original_name":"Daisy Granados","popularity":0.2077,"profile_path":"/yUFoiSKJHVdcuWqVcjuiXz6AjvF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Teresa","credit_id":"573bab40c3a3683b0600046d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolfo Llauradó","original_name":"Adolfo Llauradó","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/yvhi55olUH8pFgbWloJlcoAaQOS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ramón","credit_id":"573bab5092514167610004cf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alberto Molina","original_name":"Alberto Molina","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Sindicalista","credit_id":"573bab5f925141676b000491","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1505391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Idalia Anreus","original_name":"Idalia Anreus","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"59099e7cc3a36835ee00b609","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Benavides","original_name":"Miguel Benavides","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/vRonRnAcKn1RndaIUgL3WLMZC1u.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"59099e8a9251411cfb00b843","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1044160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Claxton","original_name":"Samuel Claxton","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"59099e8fc3a36835fc00a42d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1809279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsa Gay","original_name":"Elsa Gay","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"59099e9bc3a368357e00c012","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1809280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Germán Pinelli","original_name":"Germán Pinelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"59099ea1c3a368359d00bb7e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1460187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raúl Pomares","original_name":"Raúl Pomares","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/8UfMVssuDxhPkMRf9b5xms79izR.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"59099eaac3a368354800aa01","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1809281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alina Sánchez","original_name":"Alina Sánchez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"59099eb2c3a368354800aa0a","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pastor Vega","original_name":"Pastor Vega","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/vr3ljweWla6wc40TfYAB4nUCHaW.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d00c3a36847f8249395","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1621671,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ambrosio Fornet","original_name":"Ambrosio Fornet","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573bab11c3a3683b1800052e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1128480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pastor Vega","original_name":"Pastor Vega","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/vr3ljweWla6wc40TfYAB4nUCHaW.jpg","credit_id":"573bab1b92514167610004cb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0076619","wikidata_id":"Q7232309","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":1141,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4tqUtW0Yjy820fVLNJToWqkwyes.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2031}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hGbFBuC1U1mHhpMn1tSxqB347SU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
