He watches his former sweetheart Georgia (Maureen Mueller) from his farm down the road. Garnett is obviously socially withdrawn because of his injuries, and he soon enlists the help of itinerant young farmhand Potter Daventry (Patrick Dempsey) to deliver notes to Georgia. Garnet begins to open up to Potter before he suspects him of delivering more than letters. Potter quickly becomes a major focus in both Garnet and Georgia's lives in this drama taken from the novel by James Purdy.","popularity":0.9075,"poster_path":"/3VSL3NJgaV72adPxbusIgSywFz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3906,"logo_path":"/iSK5VQnKq7ZZKI3ge9K1DySvJYm.png","name":"American Playhouse","origin_country":"US"},{"id":898,"logo_path":"/pBh5kde6mhGEMglYLwCdFnqK5zh.png","name":"Lorimar Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":1200,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Trustees Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In a Shallow Grave","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Im Zeichen des Feuers","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Quem Ama Quem?","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Uma Chance Para Amar","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Haudatut tunteet","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Biehn","original_name":"Michael Biehn","popularity":1.5802,"profile_path":"/9oFLsADWQm2TvU8XzLIzBbjdMkU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Garnet Montrose","credit_id":"52fe4cf6c3a36847f8247267","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":164039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maureen Mueller","original_name":"Maureen Mueller","popularity":0.299,"profile_path":"/aWsyHvlmoojN9gGNQeGD6aSEG7r.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Georgina Rance","credit_id":"52fe4cf6c3a36847f824726b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Beach","original_name":"Michael Beach","popularity":1.5015,"profile_path":"/7gCBCpK2OSzuUWk5iTZds9NjqkF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Quintus Pearch","credit_id":"52fe4cf6c3a36847f824726f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Dempsey","original_name":"Patrick Dempsey","popularity":1.7686,"profile_path":"/2PpaYtXdaDmNi3jap4qPIdyVesL.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Potter Daventry","credit_id":"52fe4cf6c3a36847f8247273","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3901578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas B.
