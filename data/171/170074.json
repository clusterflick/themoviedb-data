Each one is going through or has recently experienced a painful breakup. Wesley seems to have worked through his, even though it took him close to suicide. Glenn turns inward; he's depressed and sometimes weepy. Chris seems mad at the world. Sammy looks low-key and self-contained. They know too much about each other, so as the dominoes clack and the liquor flows, the hostility they've been expressing about women gets turned toward each other.","popularity":0.521,"poster_path":"/cqVCEMofHPP8hzyqi7Uc1H4LOfs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Beat the Hell Outta Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Plummer","original_name":"Glenn Plummer","popularity":0.6662,"profile_path":"/lNfRFcxD7bhqKLZwOqdpumA83TL.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Glenn","credit_id":"5a23885e0e0a264cc40bc75b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terrence Howard","original_name":"Terrence Howard","popularity":2.0658,"profile_path":"/wXWt2NSY23v7DHe2yZQ1C8TikBp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Chris","credit_id":"5a23886cc3a3680b9a0cb581","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clyde Jones","original_name":"Clyde Jones","popularity":0.2284,"profile_path":"/2cBB2KLk9C5IBPfEleYOLDpPukK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Wesley","credit_id":"5a238887c3a3680b930c254f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1933894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles R.
