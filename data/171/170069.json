Daniele Ajort plays the simple 19th-century French peasant girl who insists that she has experienced a vision of the Virgin Mary. Once this sighting becomes common knowledge, Bernadette's very existence becomes a religious and political hot potato. Thousands of people flock to the grotto at Lourdes where Bernadette claims she has seen the Holy Mother, believing that the waters therein contain recuperative powers. Bernadette dies under a cloud of controversy, but is ultimately elevated to sainthood by the Vatican.","popularity":0.1642,"poster_path":"/4VkLjlbn7okcwEGJP0yXTb50hJ0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":197250,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinerez","origin_country":""},{"id":38741,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edition et Diffusion Cinématographique (E.D.I.C.)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The True Story of Saint Bernadette","title":"Bernadette of Lourdes","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bernadette of Lourdes","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":544198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danièle Ajoret","original_name":"Danièle Ajoret","popularity":0.1682,"profile_path":"/yNfBVXixom4x62OeyfV8ZaHgVXg.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Bernadette Soubirous","credit_id":"593bd2a992514105e200c017","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Lajarrige","original_name":"Bernard Lajarrige","popularity":0.2638,"profile_path":"/atNyQYh6j7Hvh0bQcDr0kdipIwu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"François Soubirous","credit_id":"593bd2d0925141059700bc8c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":239342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeleine Sologne","original_name":"Madeleine Sologne","popularity":0.0525,"profile_path":"/6WwusOIzu6IRauuWcSHkv5ewtJr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Madame Soubirous","credit_id":"593bd2ebc3a3680f1400b7de","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henri Nassiet","original_name":"Henri Nassiet","popularity":0.1072,"profile_path":"/yqKo9dITu44cC1ILg7mxOLLOkrt.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Le curé Peyramale","credit_id":"593bd305925141058f00c633","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Jacques Delbo","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Delbo","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":"/dqX3NXWfla0mzmgekHQVu2818p7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Le commissaire Jacomet","credit_id":"593bd327925141059700bcd6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":251083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renaud Mary","original_name":"Renaud Mary","popularity":0.1412,"profile_path":"/eibrCrS2zRfZBCJI84wbhrYjmuS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Monseigneur Forcade","credit_id":"593bd33d925141058f00c668","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":36314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadine Alari","original_name":"Nadine Alari","popularity":0.201,"profile_path":"/mblEt6viLnvo7uoDBd6BNnOFP3d.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mère Marie-Thérèse","credit_id":"593bd357925141059700bd13","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1180757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Darène","original_name":"Robert Darène","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/nwwcl6M9UQjahM93E9WQNED4xGB.jpg","credit_id":"593bd39c92514105e200c0fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1831413,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gilbert Cesbron","original_name":"Gilbert Cesbron","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/1aEWG1sth97ExuJmolKQxWisKS5.jpg","credit_id":"593bd3aac3a3680ee000d03c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0169604","wikidata_id":"Q3148546","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":791,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/4VkLjlbn7okcwEGJP0yXTb50hJ0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":535}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1961-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
