Humor is the drawing card in this version, with Jeff Goldblum a nerdish Ichabod Crane, Dick Butkus an appropriately nasty Brom Bones, and Meg Foster as spirited Katrina van Tassel. Angered that Katrina has grown fond of schoolmaster Crane, Brom Bones determines to scare off the interloper by filling his head with spooky tales of a Headless Horseman. Crane pooh-poohs the legends, until one fateful ride home in the dark of night.","popularity":1.8997,"poster_path":"/zmXqrb2dalZieCdbof5qY6KQKuC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90743,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schick Sunn Classics","origin_country":""},{"id":4664,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jensen Farley Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":6177,"logo_path":"/lPgMZcAQOgzh6PSRhC0p4jYsEWv.png","name":"Sunn Classic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Goldblum","original_name":"Jeff Goldblum","popularity":3.3862,"profile_path":"/o3PahuK7OmCI0RAQUq38CUBWYZ9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ichabod Crane","credit_id":"52fe4cf4c3a36847f82469a5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Butkus","original_name":"Dick Butkus","popularity":0.3348,"profile_path":"/peKRNFsLO46fpmd61KvfWPbDzqM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Brom Bones","credit_id":"52fe4cf4c3a36847f82469ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meg Foster","original_name":"Meg Foster","popularity":5.7832,"profile_path":"/6T6GeL0hNcsI5xtf4I5QMJv6xB7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Katrina Van Tassel","credit_id":"52fe4cf4c3a36847f82469a9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Sand","original_name":"Paul Sand","popularity":0.2951,"profile_path":"/h6PTXhdiAH94dSrs5UutrzZZhH6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Frederic Dutcher","credit_id":"58bb8f20c3a36851cd012bd0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":162229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Campbell","original_name":"Laura Campbell","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Thelma Vanderhoof Dumke","credit_id":"58bb8f49925141126a012084","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Griffith","original_name":"James Griffith","popularity":0.3459,"profile_path":"/7ES9uMQei0uAY7pTTXBAD7xLzx0.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Squire Van Tassel","credit_id":"58bb8f6bc3a368668602a896","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Ruud","original_name":"Michael Ruud","popularity":0.189,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Winthrop Palmer","credit_id":"58bb8f78c3a36866a502d315","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3818756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karin Isaacson","original_name":"Karin Isaacson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":33,"character":"Jenny","credit_id":"638fb6b615dea0007c491820","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1178364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"H.E.D.
