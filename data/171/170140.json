Cliff has stated that Two A Penny, his most dramatically challenging movie role ever, is the film he is proudest of. He has stated, \"if I did want to send a fiolm as a CV, I would send that one\". It is certainly his most demanding and controversial role; cynical, self centered and highly manipulative, Jamie Hopkins lies, steals and double-crosses his mother (Dora Bryan), forces himself on his girlfriend (Ann Holloway) and gets involved in fist fights with criminals. Through the influence of his girlfriend, a born again Christian, is the possibility that he may reform, yet in the mystery of the film's by-line \"He promised to love her forever….today\" lies the possibility that he may well not.","popularity":1.1809,"poster_path":"/gUgeino8vOngHhORTSGbotEvZ8F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1967-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He promised to love her forever….today","title":"Two A Penny","video":false,"vote_average":1.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cliff Richard","original_name":"Cliff Richard","popularity":0.4502,"profile_path":"/6GFjqrMxg1DNV6AU7HHn00p6wdj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jamie Hopkins","credit_id":"52fe4cf1c3a36847f82460ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43626,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dora Bryan","original_name":"Dora Bryan","popularity":0.2649,"profile_path":"/m244dIbw7X4okcfSSLxMgK9lvze.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ruby Hopkins","credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a36847f8246103","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avril Angers","original_name":"Avril Angers","popularity":0.1143,"profile_path":"/10vNKjecMOEV0i370CN15FOJReJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mrs Burry","credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a36847f8246107","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":219407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Holloway","original_name":"Ann Holloway","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Carol Turner","credit_id":"52fe4cf2c3a36847f824610b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geoffrey Bayldon","original_name":"Geoffrey Bayldon","popularity":0.4393,"profile_path":"/11XZ9KrxGBzDzWarlEPv1sBLIGE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"61a8cb5bc5c1ef0094ac5497","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2033157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Packer","original_name":"Tina Packer","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61a8cb621f33190088d1a093","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mona Washbourne","original_name":"Mona Washbourne","popularity":0.1679,"profile_path":"/3verXd1ywWcpiOIPxqApEV3TvTT.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61a8cb6aa24c500045d1b040","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earl Cameron","original_name":"Earl Cameron","popularity":0.255,"profile_path":"/jV8eAMdtMZCgwJqmWKdzcl3Wqnm.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"61a8cb71383df200905ef9d8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":214918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Graham","original_name":"Billy Graham","popularity":0.1952,"profile_path":"/sgloCXfR9zsOEpM7rC9lAycGXpB.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"61a8cb7b3d4d96002e6a1b50","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":202428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Evans","original_name":"Edward Evans","popularity":0.1599,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"61a8cb874a52f80064330fac","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":183207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Barkworth","original_name":"Peter Barkworth","popularity":0.242,"profile_path":"/eRuBwjmDkpctwgJYGO3ptjKY6ch.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"61a8cb9602842000457d77a9","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald Bisset","original_name":"Donald Bisset","popularity":0.1175,"profile_path":"/ygu9683wusNxHPAbimNGFgyJ8Ez.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"61a8cbb03dc3130044b381af","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James F.
