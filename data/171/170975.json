The unapologetically sentimental classic was directed by Wilhelm Dieterle, who launched a successful career in Weimar cinema before becoming known for romantic, lush melodramas and technicolor extravaganzas, including 1945′s Marlene Dietrich unforgettable Love Letters. The dashing Dieterle himself plays Harrogate, Earl of Torstein, whose star-crossed love for the luminous Rosemarie of Brauneck (Lien Deyers, discovered by Fritz Lang) is further doomed by royal heroes and villains, the requisite evil stepmother, and fantastical elements that channel the intoxicating romance of Camille through the magic of the Brothers Grimm.","popularity":0.3132,"poster_path":"/x353Ake73IB0MFSHqvb0v3nns0S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98818,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deutsche Film-Union AG (Defu) (Berlin)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1928-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Saint and Her Fool","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La sainte et son fou","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Saint and Her Fool","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Dieterle","original_name":"William Dieterle","popularity":0.3948,"profile_path":"/9xJgBwpVs7O55AH1jPt5DLioWUF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Harro, Graf von Torstein","credit_id":"5aa5be9c0e0a26075a02e13e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lien Deyers","original_name":"Lien Deyers","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/A2W0N3wrFZ4rHnogKKQyhdlefmZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rosemarie von Brauneck","credit_id":"5aa5beacc3a3687bfc02ebc8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gina Manès","original_name":"Gina Manès","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":"/tX0f14FnlxWfNzyqgrXnRrhprGA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Fürstin von Brauneck","credit_id":"5aa5bf00c3a3687bff02e9e9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1167382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Pagay","original_name":"Sophie Pagay","popularity":0.3219,"profile_path":"/mq8obGxWdkKt5xe02qTWvtjRWpp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Tante Uli","credit_id":"5aa5bf0f925141278d029232","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1361758,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camilla von Hollay","original_name":"Camilla von Hollay","popularity":0.0746,"profile_path":"/hstPdWbFkIOrAdcPkNGty9IdapG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5e63048e459ad6001855df19","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathilde Sussin","original_name":"Mathilde Sussin","popularity":0.2229,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6440b61763536a04df720363","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinrich Gotho","original_name":"Heinrich Gotho","popularity":0.0717,"profile_path":"/jQCghsU9mJ4EymcgOJNaJYALaZl.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6440b61eb3f6f5049c9d2330","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Dieterle","original_name":"William Dieterle","popularity":0.3948,"profile_path":"/9xJgBwpVs7O55AH1jPt5DLioWUF.jpg","credit_id":"59c4969cc3a368143002358d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13903,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Andrej Andrejew","original_name":"Andrej Andrejew","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6440b669e2bca804b54289ac","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48208,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Curt J.
