In the ads he announced that he was planning to blow up and mount the best of those movies into a feature documentary to be released in German cinemas. He was surprised how many home movies he received and how generously people allowed him to use them for his feature. Part 1 of \"Deutschland privat\" gives us typical German home movies of the 1970s, i.e. private holidays, family parties, etc. Part 2 consists of what is now called \"amateur porn\"; home made 8mm movies featuring real porn action.","popularity":0.1968,"poster_path":"/mt6FAiOombnusXBjvHxdHu775aL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27542,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robert van Ackeren Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Eine Anthologie des Volksfilms","title":"Deutschland privat","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Deutschland privat - Eine Anthologie des Volksfilms","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Udo Kier","original_name":"Udo Kier","popularity":1.106,"profile_path":"/8bD9dTPML8JZgkCzUu2tUN8byOG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a36847f824900d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert van Ackeren","original_name":"Robert van Ackeren","popularity":0.1241,"profile_path":"/5Hysi6U88O0zBAOevjEDcZiYLaw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a36847f8249009","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erwin Kneihsl","original_name":"Erwin Kneihsl","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cffc3a36847f8249013","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0080617","wikidata_id":"Q1206314","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mt6FAiOombnusXBjvHxdHu775aL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2804,"name":"exploitation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Locarno Film Festival","release_date":"1980-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Internationale Filmtage Hof","release_date":"1980-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
