DeMille produced this exuberant blend of orientalist melodrama and gender-bending comedy featuring his THE TEN COMMANDMENTS leading lady Leatrice Joy. An over-protective sea captain forces his daughter Eve to pass as a boy. But she craves romance and sets her sights on a handsome American tourist (Boyd) who still thinks she's a boy when she shanghais him aboard her father's ship; then a lustful Chinese pirate (Walter Long) takes them prisoner. Joy, an appealing comedienne whose career nosedived when talkies came in, sparkles in both her tomboy and love-hungry phases. -Martin Rubin, Gene Siskel Film Center","popularity":0.3131,"poster_path":"/9IJdWhcTNaKLiHkKsVjRaKgYSkz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eve's Leaves","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":100238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leatrice Joy","original_name":"Leatrice Joy","popularity":0.1136,"profile_path":"/mUrizNrPg9AfitR1kQLQnKdxEAT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Eve Corbin","credit_id":"5f05aa3461bac400369f243f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Boyd","original_name":"William Boyd","popularity":0.2758,"profile_path":"/iQNPrDYIzyHRFHmUWe3gjVA2s4r.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bill Stanley","credit_id":"5f05aa54d5ffcb00347fc45b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Edeson","original_name":"Robert Edeson","popularity":0.1969,"profile_path":"/qWHUMZ3pBUhoDH781Zhnon9xRqu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Captain Corbin","credit_id":"5f05aa741d1bf40036621dbc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Long","original_name":"Walter Long","popularity":0.122,"profile_path":"/oS2Ip4I7H5MQhKQcTNXVqMK62Im.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Chang Fang","credit_id":"5f05aa8d8a0e9b00359de073","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Harris","original_name":"Eddie Harris","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Cookie (The Cook)","credit_id":"5f05ab065e12000036e28f8a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Carle","original_name":"Richard Carle","popularity":0.2086,"profile_path":"/y7TVekUSJtf8y8V1UrRlPG71xjq.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Richard Stanley","credit_id":"5f05ab3f13a32000366e548a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sôjin Kamiyama","original_name":"Sôjin Kamiyama","popularity":0.146,"profile_path":"/ipKqPzL5eQcv7lPiEUbvjZl49ZL.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Le Sing","credit_id":"61de295ecb308400429a851d","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145837,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Sloane","original_name":"Paul Sloane","popularity":0.082,"profile_path":"/x9APM0ykaSwyqptTPMG3ExWFiza.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b61c3a368484e186643","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1690016,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Harry Chapman Ford","original_name":"Harry Chapman Ford","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f05abff61bac400359ca15f","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234677,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elmer Harris","original_name":"Elmer Harris","popularity":0.139,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6012c1f646f354003fb8aacc","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141061,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jack Jevne","original_name":"Jack Jevne","popularity":0.1274,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6012c2010816c70041831a70","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0016827","wikidata_id":"Q5416119","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Mt4Pmmg7fJprAEEgFTtz9WDUWU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1005,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9IJdWhcTNaKLiHkKsVjRaKgYSkz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":718}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1926-06-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1926-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
