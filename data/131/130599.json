In a few years, the hidden and silent violence of these policies spiraled and 30,000 citizens of different ages and social conditions were murdered. They were wrongly called the disappeared and, among them, there were young children or unborn young who were delivered in prisons of the military dictatorship and whose kidnappers abducted and registered as their own children. This movie tells the story of Estela Barnes Carlotto, a human rights activist in Argentina, chairwoman of the Association of Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who stopped being a housewife to get involved in public affairs after the kidnap of her daughter, Laura Estela Carlotto in 1977. The film is about the way her life was transformed.","popularity":0.2179,"poster_path":"/Af58Gjsv5klISNUPwqyPy0M9b6m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2011-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verdades verdaderas, la vida de Estela","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":567545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susú Pecoraro","original_name":"Susú Pecoraro","popularity":0.1919,"profile_path":"/4a4iEZsyE9bL4c4b7eOd1KJ83kN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b60c3a368484e186039","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alejandro Awada","original_name":"Alejandro Awada","popularity":0.1306,"profile_path":"/eSmf8JANABLuxrkJtzQ5JKLbcdI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b60c3a368484e18603d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inés Efrón","original_name":"Inés Efrón","popularity":0.3008,"profile_path":"/aSXV4etwXL8PGAeoFMcrmNGoSfG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b60c3a368484e186041","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":992529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Novoa","original_name":"Laura Novoa","popularity":0.274,"profile_path":"/nFRY0qc9l8nzFpXQ3WRZUVv1oc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b60c3a368484e186045","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1091848,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolás Gil Lavedra","original_name":"Nicolás Gil Lavedra","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/r3dWMmNCHufguAGxbX181lL96HE.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b60c3a368484e186035","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":583120,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"María Laura Gargarella","original_name":"María Laura Gargarella","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/w972yG8BjGZJQYUThAER0P4Tv16.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b60c3a368484e18604b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":955287,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fernando Sokolowicz","original_name":"Fernando Sokolowicz","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/lhv5ec04SErCC6Mozsrbh7ZblXM.jpg","credit_id":"5f99870fa7e3630039a6c97e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1926246","wikidata_id":"Q5573686","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1428,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Af58Gjsv5klISNUPwqyPy0M9b6m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
