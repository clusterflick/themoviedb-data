Aside from all the boys thinking she’s frigid, her recently love-struck mother is driving her round the twist. But she also has a father who she hasn’t seen for years. When Maren decides to get in touch with him, her mother finally spills the beans: He now goes by the name of Sophia and lives as a woman – just what she needs! Irrespective of her vexation, Maren risks a meeting and finds in Sophia a person just as hormonal and puerile as herself – a person who would actually prefer to be her best friend, at best even her mother. Can Maren accept that this life makes her father happy? TRANSPAPA is a compassionate and funny story of gender role-breaking, tolerance and the search for identity.","popularity":0.29,"poster_path":"/aWx4ZU0Qgpk6UgKGI6v6b8TLkvI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":425,"logo_path":null,"name":"teamWorx","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transpapa","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luisa Sappelt","original_name":"Luisa Sappelt","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Maren","credit_id":"593b897492514105b70088e1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devid Striesow","original_name":"Devid Striesow","popularity":0.3552,"profile_path":"/dV5Sdfa7ED8gkbof8pWuBfPR7lo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sophia","credit_id":"5368ca3e0e0a2647db007d01","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":33682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Borgmann","original_name":"Sandra Borgmann","popularity":0.4392,"profile_path":"/e8cMnQa6eYei6W315PgoLY5W3GK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ulrike","credit_id":"57043662c3a3686977000d60","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Horst Sachtleben","original_name":"Horst Sachtleben","popularity":0.2007,"profile_path":"/o1Vt3fAu4jMTWKSlseWeaCeczZS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Wolfgang","credit_id":"5368ca560e0a2647db007d08","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":139900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Kasumba","original_name":"Florence Kasumba","popularity":0.4352,"profile_path":"/v7armAbV6haib0fTl6ZktTUMRmg.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Tessi","credit_id":"593b8969c3a3680f33007a99","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritzi Haberlandt","original_name":"Fritzi Haberlandt","popularity":0.3119,"profile_path":"/xx2zbZBCNWYBI1oD1QT5WLzQgbC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Silke","credit_id":"5368ca6e0e0a2647cb007f0b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1601588,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arno Kempf","original_name":"Arno Kempf","popularity":0.1039,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Volker","credit_id":"570436769251415bb0000c83","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":147944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henriette Nagel","original_name":"Henriette Nagel","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":"/jYWJeaQjGX1yr5iBReOUk0SbPs7.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Zora","credit_id":"5a7a4b0e0e0a263655000fe1","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1091981,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sarah-Judith Mettke","original_name":"Sarah-Judith Mettke","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b64c3a368484e186ded","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1091981,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sarah-Judith Mettke","original_name":"Sarah-Judith Mettke","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b64c3a368484e186df3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2175997","wikidata_id":"Q1702608","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aZ9HcilzzpfxYLGtSvSQG5Whe3W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gPFJti6bOdCShizT30jtifM1QNo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/siNsghw3sKcDeANY1tPLTNO5Sms.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/aWx4ZU0Qgpk6UgKGI6v6b8TLkvI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10809,"name":"teenage girl"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":224000,"name":"lgbt parenting"},{"id":290527,"name":"transgender"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"SWR Fernsehen","release_date":"2012-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
