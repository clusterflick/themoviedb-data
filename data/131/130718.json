Dr. Pomerantz sees a few patients a week, barely enough to keep he and Yoav in ramen noodles and with a roof over their heads. In addition, he works shifts at a suicide hotline. When he gets desperate financially, he recruits hotline callers to see him privately, which is discovered and results in his getting unceremoniously fired.","popularity":0.1301,"poster_path":"/aOixPGpmLaKKMTBph6HSO9wUujJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dr. Pomerantz","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Assi Dayan","original_name":"Assi Dayan","popularity":0.2767,"profile_path":"/93TaXsjYGTrbcTZWtB1aG7bhu0D.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"ד\"ר יואל פומרנץ","credit_id":"52fe4b62c3a368484e18698f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Hanegbi","original_name":"Michael Hanegbi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/zKaLpFLracuV7yO7pbbyuWZVXDz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"יואב פומרנץ","credit_id":"52fe4b62c3a368484e186993","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":583795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rivka Michaeli","original_name":"Rivka Michaeli","popularity":0.1491,"profile_path":"/12U4h3m5wBj9sUi4rD7aKil2EMX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"רבקה צימר","credit_id":"52fe4b62c3a368484e186997","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shmil Ben Ari","original_name":"Shmil Ben Ari","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"יצחק שרמן","credit_id":"52fe4b62c3a368484e18699b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Assi Dayan","original_name":"Assi Dayan","popularity":0.2767,"profile_path":"/93TaXsjYGTrbcTZWtB1aG7bhu0D.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b62c3a368484e186985","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Assi Dayan","original_name":"Assi Dayan","popularity":0.2767,"profile_path":"/93TaXsjYGTrbcTZWtB1aG7bhu0D.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b62c3a368484e18698b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2072948","wikidata_id":"Q5304328","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/aOixPGpmLaKKMTBph6HSO9wUujJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
