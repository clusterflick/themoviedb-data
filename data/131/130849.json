The film depicts a Marilyn Monroe look-a-like slowly taking her clothes off for the camera (the viewer). The woman's actions are looped several times which gives the audience a sensation of exhaustion. That exhaustion keeps building until the very end where the woman is shown crumpled on the floor in an awkward position, which makes it appear as if she is lifeless.","popularity":0.073,"poster_path":"/igYKEVj6fIM3Kv4dxIypjgKrict.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marilyn Times Five","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":143523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arline Hunter","original_name":"Arline Hunter","popularity":0.0584,"profile_path":"/8fy3SBhvmMPtv2HYHS47cmVosln.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marilyn Monroe","credit_id":"52fe4b66c3a368484e187401","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Conner","original_name":"Bruce Conner","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/mw0E9AMe6vmSQfAfTQx53KgfIGU.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b66c3a368484e1873fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0130849","wikidata_id":"Q17040395","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/igYKEVj6fIM3Kv4dxIypjgKrict.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Festival of Independent Avant-Garde Film","release_date":"1973-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"University Art Museum, Berkeley, California","release_date":"1973-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
