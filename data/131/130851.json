Conner and Leary occupied themselves with mushroom hunts in the Mexican countryside. It’s not clear whether their hunts were successful. But Conner’s staccato home-movies of their walks – combined with movies of previous mushroom hunts in San Francisco – became his film Looking for Mushrooms. The film rushes through the rustic landscape of rural Mexico, flitting past houses and through a crumbling graveyard.  Not to be confused with Conner's re-edited 1996 version of Looking for Mushroom.","popularity":0.138,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking for Mushrooms","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Conner","original_name":"Bruce Conner","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/mw0E9AMe6vmSQfAfTQx53KgfIGU.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b66c3a368484e18740d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0309808","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":534,"name":"mexico"},{"id":333,"name":"mushroom"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Film-Makers' Cinematheque","release_date":"1967-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"University of Pennsylvania's Institute of Contemporary Art","release_date":"1967-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
