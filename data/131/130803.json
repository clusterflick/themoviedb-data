She is now an old lady, and Andalusia has long since become Europe’s vegetable plantation, with 90% of the sweet peppers in our supermarkets coming from the so-called plastic coast. It’s a lucrative business – but not for the farmers of San Agustín, whose share of profits is miniscule. This results in many of them taking on cheap labour from illegal African immigrants. A mysterious virus that threatens to destroy the crop further compounds the situation – with the affair dubbed the “cucumber crisis”. In this portrayal of a village and its people, three filmmakers highlight in nine chapters the deeper workings of industrialised agriculture – presenting another side to Southern Spain, far from its image as a beach filled, party Mecca. Like the holiday industry, vegetable growing receives criticism for its excessive exaggeration. But who are the real black sheep?","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"San Agustín - Marea baja en el mar del plástico","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1092187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Hick","original_name":"Alexander Hick","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b65c3a368484e1870ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1092188,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Schmitt","original_name":"Michael Schmitt","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b65c3a368484e1870b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1092186,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gudrun Gruber","original_name":"Gudrun Gruber","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/t5TBndmQBfXDbVSEiEryoEgWhSk.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b65c3a368484e1870a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2634188","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
