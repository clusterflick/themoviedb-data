He can’t move anything. He can’t open the cabinet, can’t pick up his bottle of Perrier, can’t open the door. He can’t even feed his fish! Suddenly, a British glam-rock band bursts in the door. The band informs Nick that he is dead and can’t leave. To escape his purgatory of abandoned dreams, he must learn the life lessons he ignored while living. Then, he’ll be judged and sent to either Heaven or hell – a jarring concept for an atheist like Nick.","popularity":0.5383,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":51532,"logo_path":null,"name":"Triumvirate, The","origin_country":""},{"id":11165,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deep Blue Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Starlight and Superfish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hayes Hargrove","original_name":"Hayes Hargrove","popularity":0.1988,"profile_path":"/4MF1Tkpe2XoGfcT7yGWPOuo7not.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Nick","credit_id":"5533333d9251411014002941","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Jure","original_name":"Matthew Jure","popularity":0.1126,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Rex","credit_id":"5533335ac3a368221f004127","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1456264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carey Peters","original_name":"Carey Peters","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Beth","credit_id":"5533337dc3a368523e000835","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":169198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Brennen","original_name":"Timothy Brennen","popularity":1.1257,"profile_path":"/tJL0OL80P9HXsZwU3pC7RD9QIB0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nick's Dad","credit_id":"553333a9c3a3682217004421","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":63234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wendi McLendon-Covey","original_name":"Wendi McLendon-Covey","popularity":0.9007,"profile_path":"/d8VKC8Ms3u9XiW4e4jsy2grP02d.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dawn","credit_id":"553333b5c3a36852de000833","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1456265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Ashley","original_name":"Sarah Ashley","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sharon","credit_id":"553333f4c3a3682219004783","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1434098,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Kopera","original_name":"Steve Kopera","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5533342792514125dc0006f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1456266,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rob Hess","original_name":"Rob Hess","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5533346b92514152910043ee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1456267,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris Huth","original_name":"Chris Huth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5533379fc3a36822170044b3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361591,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eddie Rubin","original_name":"Eddie Rubin","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"619a984867b6130094702207","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1270791","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
