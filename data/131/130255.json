Excessive speed and alcohol were involved in half of these deaths. To try to understand what is going on in these young drivers' heads when they get behind the wheel, host and documentary filmmaker Paul Arcand met with some of them. On one hand, he gives a voice to these young people who love driving fast. On the other hand, he provides a forum for two accident victims who were injured both physically and psychologically. Finally, the director meets the mother of little Bianca Leduc, who was killed by a drunk driver while she was in the care of her babysitter, and the parents of Michael Borduas, 23, who is severely disabled from an accident.","popularity":0.463,"poster_path":"/siGET9qNBiTJFH1iLk4WOo2pFVq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":280,"logo_path":"/1rwkrpgsc0pWmkvEOabbPzEsGLi.png","name":"Cinémaginaire","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2012-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Driving to the Edge","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Arcand","original_name":"Paul Arcand","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/u3PY50uaWg5dYQ2BMcglicWqdvT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"65b1ee822866fa017be38dfd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Villeneuve","original_name":"Jacques Villeneuve","popularity":0.2378,"profile_path":"/zeQYaNygnIVxOTYr6qgLLcY0IhZ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b55c3a368484e183c01","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1590180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Philippe Dion","original_name":"Jean-Philippe Dion","popularity":0.0967,"profile_path":"/5y6eJFa56cb5MZAI17N3UwKV3Es.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"65b1ee9ca802360150ae60b8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Arcand","original_name":"Paul Arcand","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/u3PY50uaWg5dYQ2BMcglicWqdvT.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b55c3a368484e183bf1","department":"Directing","job":"Script Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Arcand","original_name":"Paul Arcand","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/u3PY50uaWg5dYQ2BMcglicWqdvT.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b55c3a368484e183bfd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Arcand","original_name":"Paul Arcand","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/u3PY50uaWg5dYQ2BMcglicWqdvT.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b55c3a368484e183bf7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2298307","wikidata_id":"Q16631261","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/siGET9qNBiTJFH1iLk4WOo2pFVq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9872,"name":"grief"},{"id":13063,"name":"car accident"},{"id":157895,"name":"car driving"},{"id":165746,"name":"driving a car"},{"id":187514,"name":"speed freak"},{"id":204903,"name":"prevention"},{"id":215322,"name":"public service"},{"id":227039,"name":"dangerous driving"},{"id":237067,"name":"preventable accident"},{"id":292464,"name":"speed racing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
