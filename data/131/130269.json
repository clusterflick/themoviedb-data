Each Saturday, Alicia Vega transforms the chapel of Lo Hermida into a film screening room as she conducts a workshop for children under the auspices of the Catholic church. The hundred or so children involved had never seen a movie, and in the workshop they see and learn about the cinema: photograms and moving images, projection, camera angles and movement, film genres, and much more. And they watch movies: Chaplin, Disney, Lamorisse's 'The Red Balloon,' the Lumieres' 'The Arrival of the Train to the Station.' Finally, each child designs his own film with drawings. And then, for the first time in most of their lives, the children got to the movies in downtown Santiago.","popularity":0.2619,"poster_path":"/i4gWxNamkmODDAujxk6LiiY4JI4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181,"logo_path":"/A8SjepJ332C0YMamdFEMco0nstt.png","name":"Channel Four Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":219289,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ignacio Agüero & Asociados","origin_country":"CL"},{"id":100926,"logo_path":null,"name":"Valcine","origin_country":"CL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Hundred Children Waiting for a Train","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alicia Vega","original_name":"Alicia Vega","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/vVxbQLsJqwmw5uFRqrQPHffrr8r.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4b55c3a368484e183d69","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Agüero","original_name":"Ignacio Agüero","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/8FcqGoh3Qg9PMTMwUuX5W6gIEhQ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b55c3a368484e183d65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Agüero","original_name":"Ignacio Agüero","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/8FcqGoh3Qg9PMTMwUuX5W6gIEhQ.jpg","credit_id":"642d9a4e2dc44e01271193fd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ignacio Agüero","original_name":"Ignacio Agüero","popularity":0.0568,"profile_path":"/8FcqGoh3Qg9PMTMwUuX5W6gIEhQ.jpg","credit_id":"642d9a67158c8501263a4f29","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3996166,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Adrián Eduardo Solar","original_name":"Adrián Eduardo Solar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642de6dec9dbf900b60a14f0","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996173,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jose Antonio Contreras","original_name":"Jose Antonio Contreras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642de82e58361b0077b8896d","department":"Camera","job":"Assistant Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18479,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Maurice Jaubert","original_name":"Maurice Jaubert","popularity":0.1243,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642de922a6a4c101135507b9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1306105,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jorge Roth","original_name":"Jorge Roth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642de7590d2f530097376a7c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3996178,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Francisco González","original_name":"Francisco González","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642de8fdc9dbf90077095db0","department":"Editing","job":"Negative Cutter"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168192,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"M.
