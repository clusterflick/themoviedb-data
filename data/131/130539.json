From the bluesy, atonal  music and haunting lyrics, to the artist’s steadfast seclusion and sheer longevity, everything about this man intrigues. Twenty-five years, 34 albums, and not a single live show or public appearance. Even the simple detail of the man's real name is a mystery. Jandek on Corwood is the 89-minute documentary that explores this man, his world and his music.","popularity":0.0464,"poster_path":"/3MBEStSoD4Mp2JWBGYsAP1WE3nP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jandek on Corwood","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":671066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chad Freidrichs","original_name":"Chad Freidrichs","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63058d2bc39266007ac7c43e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":671066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chad Freidrichs","original_name":"Chad Freidrichs","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63058d23b7d3520080a4370f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":930748,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jaime Freidrichs","original_name":"Jaime Freidrichs","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5a5260c3a3683cc486f541","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235798,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Fehler","original_name":"Paul Fehler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5a52460e0a261dee6318d2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1359978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jandek","original_name":"Jandek","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5a52c3c3a3683cdb86f65f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":671066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chad Freidrichs","original_name":"Chad Freidrichs","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5a51fdc3a3683ccc86f4e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":671066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chad Freidrichs","original_name":"Chad Freidrichs","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c5a52399251413379b789c4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0381287","wikidata_id":"Q6150942","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3MBEStSoD4Mp2JWBGYsAP1WE3nP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
