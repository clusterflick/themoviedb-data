Now he has returned – and for a reason: To help his mother, Gretel, who has Alzheimer’s, and relieve her long-time carer and his father Malte for a few weeks. The filmmaker takes on the role of carer and documents this encounter with his camera. Gretel no longer knows the people around her, but her puns and charm have not faded. The time spent with his mother becomes a journey into David’s unexpected family history. Once active in Zurich’s left-wing scene, David’s parents enjoyed a lifelong “open relationship”, characterised by a loving distance and mutual respect. VERGISS MEIN NICHT is a film about dementia, but it’s first and foremost a declaration of a love of life and family.","popularity":0.1186,"poster_path":"/sp1HrT7pSny8vbufEtQYiSNR54e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forget Me Not","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1092174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gretel Sieveking","original_name":"Gretel Sieveking","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b64c3a368484e187023","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1092175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malte Sieveking","original_name":"Malte Sieveking","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4b64c3a368484e187027","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145639,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Sieveking","original_name":"David Sieveking","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/rZmM9WU3ip3sS5DTlyCHPQHqMTZ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b64c3a368484e18701f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2389530","wikidata_id":"Q15852647","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sTFwS8cQCxACXF0xzULEjNA4MCZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/rNCY1RZKDKsjsoUeDbZODxeCfaE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sp1HrT7pSny8vbufEtQYiSNR54e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":840,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/l3SXFbrTRZmGmVOzz6PzK0SX3DL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":565},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/AgamrOAk30NfDxq1YhPxbkWWzdi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"VERGISS MEIN NICHT | Trailer [HD]","key":"VqhuYR2gkzo","published_at":"2012-12-20T09:17:16.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6efc3a368544800924e"}]}}}
