Discovering a money belt on Bates, Tom carries it to town, along with a letter he finds in the pocket of the killer, which offers him the means of identifying either of the dead men. In town, Tom has a run-in with gunman One-Shot Morgan and one of Morgan's henchmen sees Tom with the money belt. Tom poses as the renegade who did the killing and is accepted by Morgan and his gang. Tom's plan is working until one of the gang who knew the killer shows up and denounces him as an impostor.","popularity":0.4341,"poster_path":"/nsowtyK6atBgo6k4ztUGwZDEBLr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10586,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reliable Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Santa Fe Bound","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Tyler","original_name":"Tom Tyler","popularity":0.3825,"profile_path":"/zvp2SbUJiFfmZN95hVf0erT8cAo.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Tom Crenshaw","credit_id":"52fe4b5ec3a368484e185c1f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":939702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Martel","original_name":"Jeanne Martel","popularity":0.0513,"profile_path":"/5R0q2VAxBdYJPk9s6zZCFzHT9yj.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Molly Bates","credit_id":"52fe4b5ec3a368484e185c23","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Cramer","original_name":"Richard Cramer","popularity":0.2818,"profile_path":"/7l1v1CPGqfi7lHvdj5Jpl7Tx8E9.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Stanton","credit_id":"52fe4b5ec3a368484e185c27","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slim Whitaker","original_name":"Slim Whitaker","popularity":0.1287,"profile_path":"/jrDw1jXr26U7XC4lTSbwUHCohf6.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"One-Shot Morgan","credit_id":"52fe4b5ec3a368484e185c2b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Cassidy","original_name":"Ed Cassidy","popularity":0.1492,"profile_path":"/lxg59gPbrG2C2DZ666WotYk4akm.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Henchman Logan","credit_id":"52fe4b5ec3a368484e185c2f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lafe McKee","original_name":"Lafe McKee","popularity":0.1904,"profile_path":"/iDR6BFkx3vJY9dN3LA3bNTAK24J.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Sheriff","credit_id":"52fe4b5ec3a368484e185c33","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":982670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Wood","original_name":"Dorothy Wood","popularity":0.3339,"profile_path":"/87pYkL4rsXAf9ny1FD8e6CMmi6K.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Bridget, housekeeper","credit_id":"52fe4b5ec3a368484e185c37","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles King","original_name":"Charles King","popularity":0.5341,"profile_path":"/1K3oq1VI6wEcv2lxI2BpoNFu6bW.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Steve Denton","credit_id":"52fe4b5ec3a368484e185c3b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Earl Dwire","original_name":"Earl Dwire","popularity":0.1649,"profile_path":"/1DZox89bVEBbTC2yu5UBLNCvO6I.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Tibbets","credit_id":"52fe4b5ec3a368484e185c3f","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123565,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carl Himm","original_name":"Carl Himm","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b5ec3a368484e185c1b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard B.
