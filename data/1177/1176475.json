This mesmerizing DVD is a wordless exploration of sea creatures that is closer to video art than a National Geographic special. Intended to relax a viewer with lush music and the calming, sinuous movements of graceful fish, dolphins, and otters, Experience the Deep is more concerned with spectacular imagery than education (though certainly much can be learned watching the ocean's animals approached with the enviable intimacy of this production's divers). Schools of silver-toned fish huddle together and flow apart like storm clouds seen at high speed. Gorgeous red-and-black swimmers cavort in the wheat-like scintilla of some critter's underbelly. A hammerhead shark floats by, more beautiful than threatening. Experience the Deep puts the viewer right in the middle of it all.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oyESbUxLAf0JIHbpmuGujwNVvrx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Experience The Deep","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oyESbUxLAf0JIHbpmuGujwNVvrx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
