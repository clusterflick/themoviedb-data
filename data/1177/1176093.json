As threatening events, including a string of unaccountable deaths, begin to expose the delicate nature of their existence, one shop worker is the only resident willing to ask questions. Jordan is a man out of time, the only one seeking truth in a community based in sexual and corporate exploitation, class inequality, and impending ecological disaster. Though he is desperate for an ally, sounding the alarm only serves to further isolate him in a town that is quickly running out of options. \"Stay at Conder Beach\" draws you into a world that vacillates between reality and metaphor, examining the intangible evils that threaten our society and have crystalized so many into a pattern of self destruction. In the end credit sequence, speculation becomes undeniable reality in the real-life footage of Grand Isle, Louisiana.","popularity":0.6568,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stay at Conder Beach","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Cross","original_name":"Joseph Cross","popularity":0.8843,"profile_path":"/exxcI1BPy7BFQvXWM5DiH7xpwPO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jordan","credit_id":"64fcbb6df8595800adc99593","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annabeth Gish","original_name":"Annabeth Gish","popularity":1.1103,"profile_path":"/wfUaE95xUJ3Kh5okDpUMZNmbcom.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Diane","credit_id":"64fcbb7aefea7a00aad5a26d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1295668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Francis Murphy","original_name":"Thomas Francis Murphy","popularity":0.2731,"profile_path":"/e7xbhH1ha1g98EPAx5lAilYwxAu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jack","credit_id":"64fcbb8c6a222701372bb891","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4262911,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jonathan Patten","original_name":"Jonathan Patten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fcbbd7dc1cb400c8bfee85","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1830064,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sean Kirby","original_name":"Sean Kirby","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/jVd0sy8MswyTUu56gzxLvh8VgIG.jpg","credit_id":"64fcbc2fefea7a00aad5a29b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2215486,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aaron Khandros","original_name":"Aaron Khandros","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fcbbacdc1cb4011fc49fb2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1056060,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zach Clark","original_name":"Zach Clark","popularity":0.1117,"profile_path":"/dXJgJNgrZEaxdnuYf2tns7XJw0t.jpg","credit_id":"64fcbc3cdc1cb4011fc49fdc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9490456","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
