Nara, Wuri's friend and Aryan's girlfriend, accompanied by their two friends Baron and Alin, also joined them. Aryan and his group had to stay in the village for seven days after Wuri's death, in accordance with tradition. These seven days became a terrifying experience. Aryan and the others were haunted by a figure called Mencadin, who resembled Wuri but with a terrifying face. The villagers believed that when someone dies unnaturally, their soul returns in a different form. It is called Mencadin: a ghostly figure with a horrifying face and a strong stench of decay.
