She called an election, and two and a half months later led the Progressive Conservatives to the biggest defeat of any major political party in Canadian history. This film documents the doomed campaign through never-before-seen interviews with Campbell, her family, colleagues and members of the media. They reflect on what brought such a hopeful candidacy to such an astounding upset.","popularity":0.0521,"poster_path":"/xXoJJyqnHBl7C8tIUvk0Yyc1M1i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kim Campbell Through the Looking Glass","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10392392","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xXoJJyqnHBl7C8tIUvk0Yyc1M1i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
