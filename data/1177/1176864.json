It is a tribute to the \"wounded generation\", the one who lost their childhood in the context of the war and the postwar period. Girls and boys who had to mature quickly. But, above all, it is a recognition of a generation of resilient, brave and fighting women who were doubly victims: by the violence of the war itself and by their status as women.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4lnkb3KTFZj5YhFJU3t6lx4ggFr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"María, memorias de una niña de la guerra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4266116,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Grimaldi","original_name":"Pedro Grimaldi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ff73042dffd8013bcd4424","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4266116,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Grimaldi","original_name":"Pedro Grimaldi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ff733a1bf266013a74981f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7940490","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4lnkb3KTFZj5YhFJU3t6lx4ggFr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":545}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5509,"name":"spanish civil war (1936-39)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
