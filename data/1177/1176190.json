This doc pays loving tribute to free-form radio and WHFS’s influence over FM stations across the US from the 1960s to the 1980s. All good things come to an end, and so did the disc-jockey-driven format that WHFS pioneered and made successful, but its legacy lives on. The station’s DJs relate its history with passion in this film that captures the tenor of an era, abetted by reminiscences of performers including Emmylou Harris, Taj Mahal, Jesse Colin Young, and others whose music found its way to ears and minds eager for something more than the same old Top 40 programming.","popularity":0.7672,"poster_path":"/wFo4bAmvfgAUApKB38YXGu2musS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":209149,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media Central Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feast Your Ears: The Story of WHFS 102.3 FM","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmylou Harris","original_name":"Emmylou Harris","popularity":0.3174,"profile_path":"/yR1AqJZu86kovV6PrRVCmxyjmU3.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"64fd1b5ff8595800e2b0797e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taj Mahal","original_name":"Taj Mahal","popularity":0.2239,"profile_path":"/q8essPzbetB5NFX0KkaaQdmnMmS.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"64fd1b6c6a222700e0f0a3f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3244867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesse Colin Young","original_name":"Jesse Colin Young","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"64fd1b78db4ed61033a0913c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonnie Raitt","original_name":"Bonnie Raitt","popularity":0.3848,"profile_path":"/lN2PD7LGsltMmZj03DpaVrd7gYJ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"66efb9390ea80d1fe38d5a61","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4263309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Schlossberg","original_name":"Jay Schlossberg","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd1afbdb4ed6104307a020","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1252291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Bangham","original_name":"Dick Bangham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd1b27f8595800c59b62c2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4263311,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Linda Bangham","original_name":"Linda Bangham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd1b33db4ed61032a5d264","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1252291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Bangham","original_name":"Dick Bangham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd1b2cdb4ed61033a090dd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4263310,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eileen Brengle","original_name":"Eileen Brengle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd1b0d6a2227011a78f161","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2862582,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Joseph Lipari","original_name":"Joseph Lipari","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd1b14f8595800adc9c2db","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"feastyourearsWHFS","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wFo4bAmvfgAUApKB38YXGu2musS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1224,"name":"radio station"},{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"},{"id":314349,"name":"baltimore, maryland"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mill Valley Film Festival","release_date":"2023-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Feast Your Ears: The Story of WHFS 102.3 FM - Trailer","key":"DpzPYafNCtQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-11-12T02:00:08.000Z","id":"64fd1ad9e0ca7f00ec8b9a02"}]}}}
