Most bats eat insects, which may not always come to mind when one thinks of predators and prey -- although the fact that a swarm of bats can eat 30,000 pounds of insects in one night is staggering. Bats make up almost one-fourth of all of the mammals in the world, but only three species of bats are \"true vampires\" who rely on the blood of other animals for sustenance.","popularity":0.391,"poster_path":"/bBA4FmJJmxLanRHIkaEzb702Avm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128,"logo_path":null,"name":"Time Warner","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Predators of the Wild: Bats","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Hootkins","original_name":"William Hootkins","popularity":0.3708,"profile_path":"/dav2i86GN0UvYIyoTwQmGE8Nweg.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"64fce97ef85958013a8dd67b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4262174,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"G.
