The documentary features the participation of historians, relatives of victims of reprisals, and even some direct testimonies of people who lived those tragic days in their youth. The city and province of Cádiz are described as a fundamental piece in the coup because, when it failed in the main cities of the country, they began to play a fundamental role in the strategy followed by the rebels in the immediate Civil War.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/57w6gRDyeb0x3dFuNiVdVaIZ0nu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tres días de julio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4266118,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Santiago Moreno Tello","original_name":"Santiago Moreno Tello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ff7422e0ca7f010de99935","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4266118,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Santiago Moreno Tello","original_name":"Santiago Moreno Tello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ff742c0bb0760120363cd6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13299382","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":974,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/57w6gRDyeb0x3dFuNiVdVaIZ0nu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":649}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5509,"name":"spanish civil war (1936-39)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
