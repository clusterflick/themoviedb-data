Folarin is a Lagos based investment banker with something to hide.

As his relationship with his glamourous society wife Jumoke unravels he finds himself sinking deeper into an illegal high stakes business deal. When his actions lead to the death of a colleague in an environment where corruption is the name of the game, he is plunged further into crisis facing pressure on all fronts.
