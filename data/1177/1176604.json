However, in its journey, the robot finds itself contemplating the remnants of the once-thriving human world, which still lingers in certain aspects. Along the way, the robot confronts a myriad of dangers and wonders, stirring genuine emotions it never thought possible. The story delves into profound themes, including war and genocide, seen through the lens of a mindless robot, the timelessness of nature, and the exploration of moral complexities between what is good and bad.","popularity":0.0445,"poster_path":"/yVUp4mnGqp54e069akB70CuNkUE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97592,"logo_path":null,"name":"LUCA School of Arts","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2024-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lands of Steel","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4265276,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cyril Vrancken","original_name":"Cyril Vrancken","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64feddc26a2227011a79d87f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4265276,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cyril Vrancken","original_name":"Cyril Vrancken","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64feddb26a222700e0f17a92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28594565","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cv70dSM3tStwrwDLmdk7DSBrTx5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vzApCFAbYfdWyq2EEDUS9I6K93f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2880}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yVUp4mnGqp54e069akB70CuNkUE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kSPc7U0vAY7VbnWSAUCoztOvdrH.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
