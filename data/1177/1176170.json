Referring to the notion Thomas Hardy termed ‘The Self-Unseeing’ in his eponymous 1901 poem, the film returns to childhood and the matters that harden us: upbringing, social status, education, labour, and familial bonds. The memoir weaves into the film as both a contemplation on mortality and an illustration of fading memory, reflecting on how we pen our pasts and how they can be re-told.","popularity":0.4361,"poster_path":"/sHRJBEulxZaDgDx5nVTnI8ek5EM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125456,"logo_path":null,"name":"AC/E","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":141371,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majority Flemish Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2023-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hit Him on the Head with a Hard Heavy Hammer","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Jane Arthur","original_name":"Rebecca Jane Arthur","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd0084f8595800e2b05ecb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1893887,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fairuz Ghammam","original_name":"Fairuz Ghammam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd02cbefea7a00c394ee6d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2305280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christina Stuhlberger","original_name":"Christina Stuhlberger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd017defea7a0137d0bd78","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Jane Arthur","original_name":"Rebecca Jane Arthur","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd00adf8595800e2b05ee3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Jane Arthur","original_name":"Rebecca Jane Arthur","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd02b4f8595800c59b482c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Jane Arthur","original_name":"Rebecca Jane Arthur","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd02db66469a00e348df89","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4263176,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Abbott","original_name":"Paul Abbott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd02f9f8595800c59b484c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4263176,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Abbott","original_name":"Paul Abbott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd0311efea7a0137d0bdd0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Jane Arthur","original_name":"Rebecca Jane Arthur","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd01296a222701372bc6ea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3018376,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rebecca Jane Arthur","original_name":"Rebecca Jane Arthur","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd02ea6a222700c3b43f75","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2515042,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aurélien Lebourg","original_name":"Aurélien Lebourg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fd031fe0ca7f00ae3dd360","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1458,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sHRJBEulxZaDgDx5nVTnI8ek5EM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":972}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":157955,"name":"childhood"},{"id":212755,"name":"personal diary"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":292939,"name":"fading memories"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Open City Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
