When I came home, I found inside the handbag lots of papers. Amongst them, two letters dated 1946, unsent. Their author announced his imminent suicide, due to the negative effects of war, prison and the lost of his family. El ultimo abrazo (The last embrace) is a short documentary film about our research, from the moment we found the letters until we find out who had written these letters, what had driven him to take his own life and why were both letters together and unsent.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/ugBKluPp98FdUPxq1oukT3PNNUh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El último abrazo","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4266108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergi Pitarch Garrido","original_name":"Sergi Pitarch Garrido","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ff7120db4ed6104308a1b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4266108,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergi Pitarch Garrido","original_name":"Sergi Pitarch Garrido","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ff717b2dffd801001488d0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4381714","wikidata_id":"Q19516191","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2857,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ugBKluPp98FdUPxq1oukT3PNNUh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5509,"name":"spanish civil war (1936-39)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
