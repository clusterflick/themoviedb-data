If you can't SEE? Can't love this beauty. If you can't TALK like that ... that situation is very critical. Nor can this Flute Man speak. His voice is the flute ... Whatever the man plays on the flute, only a 4-year-old child named Muthu can understand it. Why. .. Even the 6 year old girl named Chinnu who lived in that house does not understand. This family of three orphans laughs, remembers, and walks in time. He makes his own flute as a birthday present for the Pearl Man. This flute one day slips out of Chinnu's hand and falls into the pool. And Pearl jumps into the pool, ... dying. Thus the man lives in the memory of the Muthu. Then the hero's friend and girlfriend join the hero in an ashram. Unable to bear the cruelty of that pastor, he commits suicide. Seeing this, Chinnu suffers from mental illness and dies in her mother's grave.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pullaanguzhal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
