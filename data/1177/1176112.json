His work and career straddled the eras of Brill Building pop, the British Invasion, and folk-rock, right through to 1970s pop. His talent and keen sense of where popular culture was heading sent him and his partner and wife Cher into the birth of the counterculture and through to a post-rock career in Las Vegas and onto television and politics.","popularity":0.6655,"poster_path":"/jN9swpHNckcl77xsv7ijw0oM2m9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sonny Bono Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonny Bono","original_name":"Sonny Bono","popularity":0.2985,"profile_path":"/lf3RiHakkpqcoAYeJJhDzmpr4H6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"64fcd66f66469a00adfbc1c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cher","original_name":"Cher","popularity":1.5126,"profile_path":"/yDglV70XMu2cBWZigp5Jxd4etfv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"64fcd67edb4ed610363d5ca8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1452799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Forbes","original_name":"Jim Forbes","popularity":0.1974,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64fcd691db4ed610363d5cad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4263006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances Bono","original_name":"Frances Bono","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64fcd6a2efea7a00fd19a247","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4262352,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elyse Schiller","original_name":"Elyse Schiller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fcd6c5dc1cb401028d9695","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jN9swpHNckcl77xsv7ijw0oM2m9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
