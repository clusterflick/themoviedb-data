The film provides little-known data from that episode, such as official documents that show that democratic Italy continued to receive money from Spain for its participation in the war. In 2013, the Barcelona Court accepted a complaint against the Italian pilots who participated in the bombings. The victims, for their part, are still waiting for Italy to apologize for these events.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xUxEotJ2S5tZdoR4eCPbROCxEO9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barcellona, ferita aperta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Barcelona, herida abierta","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4266139,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mónica Uriel","original_name":"Mónica Uriel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ff76edeb14fa011d52c9f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5891056","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xUxEotJ2S5tZdoR4eCPbROCxEO9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5509,"name":"spanish civil war (1936-39)"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
