Connecting two fictional stories and reality, they refer to the dilemma of creation and the birth of the spirit.\r ​From the train to space, then the space to the deep sea, finally back to the train on the shore. The story talks about how humans evolve during times and how they separated from the sea to develop their inner sea.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2020-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Train, Point Nemo, Astronaut and Starling","video":false,"vote_average":0.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2858522,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tzu Huan Lin","original_name":"Tzu Huan Lin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb27ffba22d3e003e0732e6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
