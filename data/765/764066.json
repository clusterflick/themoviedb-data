His awe is mixed with sadness, however. The wetlands are rapidly disappearing, largely due to environmental damage caused by pipeline canals. His is just one of the five stories this film intimately follows: from a local fisherman, to a biological scientist, to the Native American people of the United Houma Nation who call the wetlands home. By capturing the lives, livelihoods, and cultures facing extinction along with this precious ecosystem (and the city of New Orleans that it protects), Last Call For the Bayou is a cinematic call to action: act now, or let these myriad histories be lost forever.","popularity":0.0536,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Call for the Bayou","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2304255,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nadia Gill","original_name":"Nadia Gill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faf7033d55e4d003ccef058","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominic Gill","original_name":"Dominic Gill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faf7010b54002003f584606","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11156632","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
