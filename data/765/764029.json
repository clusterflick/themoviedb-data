In Georgia (South Caucasus), men’s choirs have been singing lullabies on stage since at least the end of the 19th century, as the movement of national liberation from the Russian empire favored the affirmation of the Georgian cultural uniqueness. Polyphonic cradlesongs performed by men’s, women’s or mixed choirs in the different regional styles have become a new musical genre added to the repertoire of traditional national folklore. Individual as well as choral lullabies are called Nana.","popularity":0.0897,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Polyphonic Lullabies Of Kakheti","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855590,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Steven Taylor","original_name":"Steven Taylor","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faf3744e24e3a0040e4c0f0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855588,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nino Tsitsishvili","original_name":"Nino Tsitsishvili","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faf371ae24e3a003de4a0d0","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855589,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Elizabeth Workman","original_name":"Elizabeth Workman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faf3729ec45520040f515de","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nona Lomidze","original_name":"Nona Lomidze","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faf369e945c20003ee70d46","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855587,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nugzar Kozmanashvili","original_name":"Nugzar Kozmanashvili","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faf36e29ca75900404973ae","department":"Crew","job":"Driver"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nona Lomidze","original_name":"Nona Lomidze","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faf370cc15f890041821758","department":"Crew","job":"Transcriptions"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855591,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vladimir Nassyrkine","original_name":"Vladimir Nassyrkine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faf37574a4bfc003fb391f3","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1352427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Zemp","original_name":"Hugo Zemp","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faf3686fcb8cc003ea40cd0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1352427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Zemp","original_name":"Hugo Zemp","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faf36fa13af5f003f3a28a9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nona Lomidze","original_name":"Nona Lomidze","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faf36c913af5f003e3a40ad","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
