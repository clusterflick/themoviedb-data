Cavalrymen ride their horses, first over low hedges, then over increasingly rough terrain, until by the end they are sliding down hills to cross a stream and going into caves.

I told you this wasn't a good idea.\"","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":143826,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ambrosio e C.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1906-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La scuola di cavalleria in Pinerolo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Cavalry School in Pinerolo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1391419,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Giovanni Vitrotti","original_name":"Giovanni Vitrotti","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb1e5457caa47003e8b1f2a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0378719","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1906-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
