In this world, there is a cozy little light in the window and the clock is ticking. And then, this secluded children’s world is ruthlessly invaded by a large adult war. The camera captures details and scrutinizes textures, immersing the spectator into history through a biography of things, where music and sound design become the main vehicles. The soundtrack of the performance-film features songs and poems in Yiddish from the repertoire of Leibu Levin, reader and composer.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacred Talisman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Svyashchennyy talisman","type":"Transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Svyaschennyy talisman","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2855991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Galitskaya","original_name":"Olga Galitskaya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fafcff5945c20003fe7f0c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2855992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taras Glushakov","original_name":"Taras Glushakov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fafd014202e1100411ce03a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2855993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexey Leontyev","original_name":"Alexey Leontyev","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5fafd036b54002003e58872e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2577073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alisa Selnikova","original_name":"Alisa Selnikova","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fafd074626208003eb2e3a0","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2312539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Plutakhin","original_name":"Mikhail Plutakhin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fafd09213af5f00413b8687","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2312539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Plutakhin","original_name":"Mikhail Plutakhin","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fafd096d8f44e003df644b3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Zilant International Film Festival","release_date":"2020-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
