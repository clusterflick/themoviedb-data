It would undoubtedly give inspiration to people of all walks of life to never surrender amidst life adversities as we relate the message of this film which is centered to the unfathomable will of a person to persevere in every challenge set before him. Being the source of such inspiration is somehow a noble undertaking that no amount of money can buy.","popularity":0.2885,"poster_path":"/vaWTaGBHAVW2i1IFDhcGsnn2gZs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2015-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plastic Bag","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2857218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillermo Ayala Jr.","original_name":"Guillermo Ayala Jr.","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5fb1049b13af5f00403d5fb4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2857220,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Juvelyn Requiso","original_name":"Juvelyn Requiso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb104cdc15f890041852a24","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2857219,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jelford Teves","original_name":"Jelford Teves","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb104b25ed962003f12679e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2841883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bryan Jimenez","original_name":"Bryan Jimenez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb104ff9b6e47003da5d321","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2841883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bryan Jimenez","original_name":"Bryan Jimenez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb10512626208003eb4e094","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1504,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vaWTaGBHAVW2i1IFDhcGsnn2gZs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1003}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10508,"name":"teacher"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
