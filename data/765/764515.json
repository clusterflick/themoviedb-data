They dedicate their free time in summer to approach, little by little, tasks that perhaps one day will become their professions. Sol uses her piano lessons to review old musical recordings and prepares an exam for the music conservatory. Meanwhile, Pedro takes an interest in dramaturgy and starts a writing workshop without telling anyone. In these days shared with other young and adult people, Pedro and Sol watch. They are growing up, even without realizing it.","popularity":0.1094,"poster_path":"/80hi9periZ8mQnXKLVzNd8pV4YQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148398,"logo_path":null,"name":"Esquimal
