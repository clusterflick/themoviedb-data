From 1945 till 1946, he served in the U.S. Army and acted as a censor of mail to and from Nazi prisoners at the Nuremberg Trials. After the trials, Joseph succeeded as a humanities scholar and an educator - he settled in Columbus, Ohio, graduated from The Ohio State University, and taught French at Denison University until his retirement in 1990. But the past is not forgotten: Arnold talks about his unique experience of distant contact with the minds of people who were accused of war crimes against his own people.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Censoring Nuremburg","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Raycroft","original_name":"Tim Raycroft","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fafd71eb54002003e588c16","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Raycroft","original_name":"Tim Raycroft","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fafd71a945c20003ee7cf38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856019,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bussan","original_name":"David Bussan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fafd728d0b434003e9dd422","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856019,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bussan","original_name":"David Bussan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fafd72d202e1100421d2757","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Warsaw Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2019-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2020-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Oregon Documentary Film Festival Winter","release_date":"2019-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Censoring Nuremberg (Trailer)","key":"372712865","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-11-12T19:47:26.000Z","id":"63067238ca7ec6007efbe45e"}]}}}
