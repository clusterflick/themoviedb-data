In 2020 the Reds finally lifted their 19th top-flight title and the club's first of the Premier League era.

Yet this was still a campaign for Reds' fans to savour, thanks to surely one of the greatest sides to call Anfield home. With the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup also added to the Anfield trophy cabinet, 2019-20 was a season that suggests J端rgen Klopp could be building a football dynasty to rival those of Liverpool FC's glorious past.","popularity":0.1199,"poster_path":"/4hF3CvhLpma8MpKVLMwvrJKk5OO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":323,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Champions: Liverpool Football Club Season Review 2019-20","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1179492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J端rgen Klopp","original_name":"J端rgen Klopp","popularity":0.1373,"profile_path":"/mBjRYgCjDWnZ9IVXS7mmVOBpPJ2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fecef14abdafc003eed3547","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2525754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alisson Becker","original_name":"Alisson Becker","popularity":0.6394,"profile_path":"/87BlUC9tL4FfDF23OQPnP1O0fEj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fecef1e12970c00409f87ef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2525757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberto Firmino","original_name":"Roberto Firmino","popularity":0.1215,"profile_path":"/snn9rv5enU6eJOW9FRgHTyi1erq.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fecef360f3655003faaa8bc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1567897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Henderson","original_name":"Jordan Henderson","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/fhtXT9C5wMHq7J4ejMiCY1bpDuF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fecef3e0f3655003faaa990","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2920512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Milner","original_name":"James Milner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/3K4DD4Jrr6hTWwFE75NpoQL3RhH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ff0b8c5df294500412a060a","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4hF3CvhLpma8MpKVLMwvrJKk5OO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1062}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
