The film experiments with this legal document and personalizes the process. With this film I physically wrote out the words of my Will onto unexposed 35mm black and white film stock using a small pen light. I worked in complete darkness so that the only areas exposed to light are the areas physically touched by the light source.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pJOdEpejbUx0ay7VH4WJUPri6qi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Last Words","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855548,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cooper","original_name":"Cooper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5faf275313af5f00413a3471","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pJOdEpejbUx0ay7VH4WJUPri6qi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
