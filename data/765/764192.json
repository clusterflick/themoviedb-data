Now she is 95 years old and lives in Australia. The director and artist Thea Weiss is married to Lotte’s son. Lotte’s stories and experiences inspired Thea to create a documentary. During the war, thousands of Slovak Jews were deported to the death camps. Only 500 survived, and Lotte was one of them. The amount of vital energy she has helped her not only to survive the torture and devastation but also, having carried the trauma in her memory through decades, to remain whole. Her capacity for kindness, forgiveness, and love gave her the strength and the will for survival.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2020-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Two Lives, Creative Response to the Holocaust","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thea Weiss","original_name":"Thea Weiss","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5fafd9f0db154f003e4947cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lotte Weiss","original_name":"Lotte Weiss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5fafd9f9ec4552003ff62fd1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarita Gold","original_name":"Sarita Gold","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fafd9bc4a4bfc0042b4ae79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856045,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarita Gold","original_name":"Sarita Gold","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fafd9c9c15f89003e82b8ea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"275302256499602","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2020-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
