I Dream of Vancouver is an experimental short that explores this question through the digital landscape of Vancouver, BC. Using hypnagogic visuals and a haunting soundscape, this work expresses the detachment from the lived experience of spaces as these spaces are subsumed by algorithms and mediated images. While focusing on Vancouver as a case study, this documentary explores issues that are relevant to the world at large, such as the link between corporate technologies and gentrification and the erasure of those who don’t fit within Google’s agenda.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/yPPRBBetWhx0VxC2bGtuKpgdro0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Dream of Vancouver","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2855898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marianne Thodas","original_name":"Marianne Thodas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xOrNRkFgeRnrO6LGu1jkAaK1P0j.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Participant","credit_id":"5fafbd95d8f44e003ef6ae3c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Stonehouse","original_name":"Jonathan Stonehouse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Participant","credit_id":"5fafbd9e9b6e47003fa3f7cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Williscroft","original_name":"Colin Williscroft","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Participant","credit_id":"5fafbdabc15f89003f82e3ee","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Williscroft","original_name":"Colin Williscroft","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628e3cca1a32483b6311ed57","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855896,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jonathan Stonehouse","original_name":"Jonathan Stonehouse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fafbd48498ef9003e80afd9","department":"Sound","job":"Additional Soundtrack"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Warren Chan","original_name":"Warren Chan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fafbd0c945c20003fe7e42b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vsLTxUtSnJJWBzMgtngmjCdxcEK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yPPRBBetWhx0VxC2bGtuKpgdro0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
