Train stops at next station and lady enters with her pet dog. Having bundles of her own which she wishes to place in the rack over her seat, she takes down the old man's bundles and places them on him and his seat. She then begins to fondle the dog. Old man gets angry, takes his large pipe and begins to smoke. Lady objects and after an argument snatches the pipe from the man and throws it out the window.
