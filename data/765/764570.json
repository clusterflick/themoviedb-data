She discovers him weakened in the darkest dungeon, but will she be able to rescue him before it is too late?  The themes of oppression and isolation, but also of hope and the power of love, make Fidelio the perfect opera for our times. Garsington Operaâ€™s outstanding cast, led by Katherine Broderick as Leonore and Toby Spence as Florestan, performs Peter Mumford's semi-staged concert of Beethoven's masterwork, complete with a beautifully filmed backdrop.","popularity":0.2721,"poster_path":"/tNsmhmvLfqD4G9A6B1vylK56tDN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beethoven: Fidelio (Garsington Opera)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":780,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tNsmhmvLfqD4G9A6B1vylK56tDN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":520}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":223778,"name":"ludwig van beethoven"},{"id":286572,"name":"fidelio"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
