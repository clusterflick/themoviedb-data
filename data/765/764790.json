We can see the diarist physically and emotionally evolving throughout her eight semesters in the Big Apple. Such onscreen “confessionals” stem from the first major example of reality TV, The Real World. Interspersed throughout are commercial-like vignettes that further critique what it’s like to live in the world today. In Untitled Fall '95, Bag displays a profound self-awareness that evokes empathy on behalf of the viewer, despite her work’s glaring artificiality.","popularity":0.2821,"poster_path":"/5QnLJxBluRHQdSPui1l3cyO4ZPm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled Fall '95","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Untitled '95","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2857981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Bag","original_name":"Alex Bag","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Various","credit_id":"5fb1a01d12c6040040b55be2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2857981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Bag","original_name":"Alex Bag","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb1a0355ed962003d12f137","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2857981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Bag","original_name":"Alex Bag","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb1a042d8f44e003ef9ea6f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1012,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fNmIAQUDmkybV8cAmEL41b0cjDd.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1800}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2571,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fo80tympxVQzHcw5PbSQjt7KQWD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1713},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5QnLJxBluRHQdSPui1l3cyO4ZPm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11800,"name":"mockumentary"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":246993,"name":"video diary"},{"id":250871,"name":"video artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1995-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
