The structure is made up of forty-two school buses that were linked together and buried under twelve feet of concrete and earth.  Over the years, the project has attracted the attention of people across the world and has been met with differing opinions—from other 'preppers' who celebrate it, to folks who think the whole idea is crazy.  'You Will Survive Doomsday' is a portrait of Bruce that explores his unconventional journey and the reasons behind it.","popularity":0.3395,"poster_path":"/qRpbnHNsDCtxUkEs00DqbI5ZTZq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143846,"logo_path":null,"name":"Outpost Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Will Survive Doomsday","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2858475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Beach","original_name":"Bruce Beach","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fb2736cb6cff1003ac795df","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2858468,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kyle McDougall","original_name":"Kyle McDougall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb273eb7352050042180493","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2858469,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Brad Brown","original_name":"Brad Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb26f0ad55e4d003ed3e708","department":"Camera","job":"Grip"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2858468,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kyle McDougall","original_name":"Kyle McDougall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb26eefe24e3a0040e9ecc6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2858468,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kyle McDougall","original_name":"Kyle McDougall","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb26ef7b6cff1003ac7915d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":785,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vIA628lwhXHXJ5PnLAIOJJrVz1B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1395}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":990,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qRpbnHNsDCtxUkEs00DqbI5ZTZq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":660}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":34161,"name":"doomsday"},{"id":158419,"name":"nuclear fallout"},{"id":208214,"name":"prepper"},{"id":227169,"name":"bomb shelter"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"You Will Survive Doomsday - A Short Documentary Film","key":"XsMFJT-Vna4","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2020-11-15T16:26:17.000Z","id":"5fb26e9e7caa4700418d407a"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"You Will Survive Doomsday","key":"330623972","site":"Vimeo","size":2160,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2019-04-15T22:37:37.000Z","id":"5fb26eaa4a4bfc0042b8c3be"}]}}}
