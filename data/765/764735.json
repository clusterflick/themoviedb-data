A movie is said to move when the moves through the projection mechanism. Life is said to move on; there's also moving on for expiring in the sense of dying. A brief and interminable text, said by Chekhov and written by Sarraute, that Negro returns to us on an amnesiac image. This tale goes from Chekhov to Sarraute to Negro up to where we are - a body, before a page, a screen, a face. It's interminable.
