My day to day routines and deviations from it are captured as 6 months pass on the screen in a blur. Musique concr√®te accompanies the visuals taken from vocal samples of myself as a child and repurposed. Ruminations on nostalgia, film as material and 16mm as a particularly evocative medium with a long history of home movies and nonprofessional filmmaking. The film acts as a document, archiving time and place, as a way for me to recount where and what I did at this point in my life-a point where I still feel an existential drifting and listlessness. Something to look back at and only make sense of after the fact.","popularity":0.1728,"poster_path":"/jPS2DMYSztHOdXYGHUzti9kn4No.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Past Life (January - June)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2855884,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Cadkin","original_name":"Charles Cadkin","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fafba2a735205003f13dfa6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11506814","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jPS2DMYSztHOdXYGHUzti9kn4No.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Save the Archives Film Festival","release_date":"2019-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moviate Underground Film Festival","release_date":"2020-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Past Life (January - June) Excerpt","key":"363867741","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2019-10-02T17:21:56.000Z","id":"5fafb9c2945c200041e8566d"}]}}}
