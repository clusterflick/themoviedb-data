Ленинград","overview":"The film is about the unknown pages of the siege of Leningrad, about the Holocaust at the walls of the city, where the terrible mass murder of Jews took place. In these terrible days, the community found its leader. They became Abram Ruvimovich Lobanov, who in 1943 officially became a Rabbi of Leningrad. Every year, on January 27, the Great choral synagogue of St. Petersburg holds prayers in memory of the victims of the Holocaust, all the besiegers, all the defenders and liberators of Leningrad. They were first performed on January 27, 1944. The film will also tell about a new date in the Jewish calendar - 26 Iyar, the day of salvation and liberation. It was 26 Iyar, or may 9, that marked a turning point in Jewish history, thanks to which the Jews were not only saved from complete destruction, but also found their national home — the state of Israel.","popularity":0.0527,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"26 Iyar.
