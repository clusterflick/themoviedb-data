The story begins with Matsuchiyo’s wartime childhood. She and her mother were the only two surviving members of the family. Matsuchiyo joins an “Okiya” (a traditional geisha agency), to pay the family debts and support her ageing mother. In her adulthood, Matsuchiyo becomes one of the top geisha in the city of Atami and experiences romance, tearful farewells, being a mistress of married men, motherhood and tragic deaths. Today, in her 80’s, Matsuchiyo the geisha, is as motivated and inspiring as ever. She still delivers a mesmerising performance on stage. ‘Matsuchiyo - Life of a Geisha’ is narrated by her own son and film director, Ken Nishikawa, and it is adorned by hundreds of beautiful pictures from Japan’s bygone era. This film illustrates the trials and tribulations of the ultimate Japanese cultural enigma that is - The Life of a Geisha.","popularity":0.2007,"poster_path":"/2bzmkI5ePKIzFUBhMx7TTwQr1Iy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2018-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Matsuchiyo - Life of a Geisha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2196513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Nishikawa","original_name":"Ken Nishikawa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb1b42912c6040041b66d68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2200866","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w8WCrXFbZO2EQg1ecMcy4lT7PKt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2bzmkI5ePKIzFUBhMx7TTwQr1Iy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4342,"name":"geisha"},{"id":273133,"name":"atami"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"Raindance Film Festival","release_date":"2018-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Matsuchiyo - Life of a Geisha 2018 teaser","key":"lr0OAB0Kmn0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2018-08-22T07:32:04.000Z","id":"5fb1b539c15f89003e84bddf"}]}}}
