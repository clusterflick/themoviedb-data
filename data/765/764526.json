Sieverts is interested in spaces created by misplanned development patterns. Places that defied control or were just forgotten, but still shape the face of a town. Following an invitation of the Goethe Institute in Warsaw in the context of the “promised cities” programme, Boris Sieverts is going to offer a tour through Poland’s capital Warsaw in 2010. The film will accompany this unique artist on his trip to and through Warsaw, telling the audience about this extraordinary city, its places and dynamic, town planning and social coexistence.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warsaw Frankenstein","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1683759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christiane Büchner","original_name":"Christiane Büchner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb586a8d38b580041ecce67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
