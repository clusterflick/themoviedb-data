The German-Italian knows the USA like only a few people because he studied there and later he reported from there as an US correspondent. He is also married to an American. That is why he has many relatives in the United States. But the rift that runs through American society also runs right through his in-laws living there. While father-in-law Paul is a supporter of the Republicans under Donald Trump, his wife Jiff and mother-in-law Lynn are supporters of the Democrats and concerned for their country. As an African American, the second husband of his mother-in-law brings his own insights into the increased racism in the country. Zamperoni embarks on a family-political search for the causes in order to understand why the whole country and its family are so torn.","popularity":0.1529,"poster_path":"/9V1tWBuRbSar2t9Wo440hXQhDpp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trump,
