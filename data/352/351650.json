It is a sketchy and slanted remembering. They decide to shoot a film of this memory, a foggy tale with scant connection to the original but feeling the patronage of that text. Being artists and tricksters, they do it as a game, all in one week, with donated short-ends and gestural implications to narrative. What they really do is visit after years of not visiting. Endless talks about the state of the planet and our access to knowledge or the ineptitude of art. All this talking and the film turns out with almost no dialogue but sweeps through the city of Baltimore (which is often destitute, tropical and friendly).","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/izeizIDArVU7rbW4DQPWPRBLTxV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Razor's Edge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1208762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Barber","original_name":"Stephanie Barber","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/2IuOe0ooAUmwLJuAWWBUcvayl4V.jpg","credit_id":"55b4886d92514125da013e9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490464,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xav Leplae","original_name":"Xav Leplae","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55b488769251411e0f013f38","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/izeizIDArVU7rbW4DQPWPRBLTxV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
