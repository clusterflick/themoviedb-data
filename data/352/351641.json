The marriage of these two elements is an odd tension: the tale of the play, the threat of limb extraction, asks the necessity of \"whole and what the elements are which compose complete.\"","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/b5XkSLnCpOUpuaf50S005k7dqpA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metronome","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1208762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Barber","original_name":"Stephanie Barber","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/2IuOe0ooAUmwLJuAWWBUcvayl4V.jpg","credit_id":"55b46f96c3a3682ff90125cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b5XkSLnCpOUpuaf50S005k7dqpA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
