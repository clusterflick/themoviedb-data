Wrong choices. The divorce of ethereal beauty and mystery so common in experimental films. In Stephanie Barber's films. What begins as devastatingly awkward or \"tender\" unfolds itself to show a deceptive, strangely rigid literary formalism commented upon by the content. The two (form and content) dance around, moving towards and away from each other in the tricky, clear dialogue. Hyper-reflexivity, art and love (and the role faith plays in each of these). The filmmaker writes, \"I, myself, feel safest around purposefulness, can read more clearly an artist's work when I trust that choices have been weighed, bear meaning. This film requires a great deal of faith because it is strange and labile. Its device-ness is so apparent as to have left it naked. And then so naked as to be, perhaps, closed again.\"","popularity":0.1911,"poster_path":"/uBRsbfTrbcEM81JpaDFfNl62sRi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dogs","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1208762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Barber","original_name":"Stephanie Barber","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/2IuOe0ooAUmwLJuAWWBUcvayl4V.jpg","credit_id":"55b471a09251411e0f013d15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uBRsbfTrbcEM81JpaDFfNl62sRi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
