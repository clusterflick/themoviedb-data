The images are taken mostly on Disney World rides where one is shown facsimiles of people from far away lands. The soundtrack, a little more than half-way through, ceases its cricketing and, against impressionistic waterfalls, mentions love (\"they have love here\") which must then be thought of in the context of this same wonder, possession and amusement. The film ends with a series of flights.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1xG3btB2BkZj1MQFX3r8qDy4A5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Invented Machines","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1208762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephanie Barber","original_name":"Stephanie Barber","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/2IuOe0ooAUmwLJuAWWBUcvayl4V.jpg","credit_id":"55b45791c3a3683002013472","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1xG3btB2BkZj1MQFX3r8qDy4A5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
