An impish devil appears and urges him to drop his bone and dive into the water after the bigger one. He does and finds nothing while losing his bone. He finds another bone at an Italian restaurant and as he returns over the same stream the imp appears again. Will Puddy be fooled again?","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dog and the Bone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Gordon","original_name":"George Gordon","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55b224649251411e1401053b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0150360","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
