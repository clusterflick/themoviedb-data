Samantha is her best friend and wears earrings in the shape of bones and leopard print leggings, like The Flinstones. There's also a pissed off pimp who never takes his sunglasses off. And a gypsy woman who smokes cigars and knows everything. And Hollywood star pictures glued to raunchy walls. And a parking lot full of whores, light bulbs and parties. And Jesuschrist. And a Hindu man passed out because of a blow job. And a lot of night exteriors, New York's, to be precise. And a pair of plastic tits that have disappeared. NIGHT FLOWERS is the punky and surreal fairytale in which all of this comes together to make sense. A short film about friendship, bravery and the ability to have dreams in other to survive. Maybe, deep down, that's what life is: a funny, tender and offbeat road trip, filled with feelings, in the search of a pair of plastic missing tits.","popularity":0.3874,"poster_path":"/A3RvuF87Od4Qngy95OshrnoGdce.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Go to Hollywood, grab your tits and make us all proud, ok kid?","title":"Night Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Night Flowers","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1491128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyle Ingleman","original_name":"Kyle Ingleman","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":"/tSJyvWGaPWSurBFwfraJtTl2BlB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lula","credit_id":"55b6ea1992514120e9001065","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Sharp","original_name":"Doug Sharp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Samantha","credit_id":"55b6ea3392514120e10011eb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Clough","original_name":"Jon Clough","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Renzo","credit_id":"55b6ea4f92514120f0001124","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":128205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diane Sellers","original_name":"Diane Sellers","popularity":0.2341,"profile_path":"/2e00pN04z7GnhVtxdAa2XpFmnN5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gypsy","credit_id":"55b6ea6dc3a368227c0010bb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rav Val Denegro","original_name":"Rav Val Denegro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Taxi driver","credit_id":"55b6ea8e92514120e1001200","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1298406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Javier Giner","original_name":"Javier Giner","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55b6e995c3a3682288001098","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2375339","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A3RvuF87Od4Qngy95OshrnoGdce.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":664}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":108,"name":"transvestism"},{"id":13059,"name":"prostitution"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
