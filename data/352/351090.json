He is joined in these plans by one of the bank's directors, but when Doris unknowingly snubs the director's wife, he pulls out his aid. Dick finds himself in serious trouble, and then Doris leaves him after an argument. She is about to leave for the Orient with her daughter Bessie, a friend, Mrs. Prescott, and an admirer, Patrick Alliston, but they are stopped at the station because Dick is believed to be with them. He isn't, and his difficulties drive him to an aborted suicide attempt. Doris finally wakes up to what is going on and reconciles with Dick. The bank examiner looks over the books and helps Dick get back on his feet, much to the director's chagrin.","popularity":0.1701,"poster_path":"/tO1zIW5q2Ufi879DDoIniMCJSt4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36883,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peerless Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Husband and Wife","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1275688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Clayton","original_name":"Ethel Clayton","popularity":0.0684,"profile_path":"/pEKusLCieVqAOEfRB2CXAtibTeZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Doris Baker","credit_id":"55b0c0e59251411e0b00e10f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1427628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holbrook Blinn","original_name":"Holbrook Blinn","popularity":0.0909,"profile_path":"/3SyVfnamphWjTjmrygEEG3fv83F.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Richard Baker","credit_id":"55b0c396c3a368648e00caf4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madge Evans","original_name":"Madge Evans","popularity":0.2079,"profile_path":"/pl8Za5y7tmMoCgTRkpCcSFISvxd.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Bessie","credit_id":"55b0c3ab9251411e1800dc6b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Montagu Love","original_name":"Montagu Love","popularity":0.1957,"profile_path":"/aCOahFpYdCKMOg8RO9jMsFOA5xx.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Patrick Alliston","credit_id":"55b0c3c6925141788b000236","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alec B.
