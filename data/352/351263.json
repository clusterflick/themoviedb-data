The basic story pretty much follows the book: McTeague (Holbrook Blinn) is a coarse young man who becomes a dentist, after a fashion. He is rivals for the hand of Trina Sieppe (Fania Marinoff) with his pal Marcus Schuller (Walter Green). McTeague weds her and she wins the lottery. But she refuses to let go of the money, and her miserly attitude destroys the marriage.","popularity":0.1057,"poster_path":"/ri0P7ocyF8vaqUdYFPNOGSebmQJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59071,"logo_path":null,"name":"William A.
