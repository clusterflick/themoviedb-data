A young woman counts the days remaining before she is arrested. A man returns to society after 17 years in prison. A mother records every phone conversation she had with her imprisoned daughter on 125 cassette tapes. An intellect and professor of journalism tries to find himself from the solitude of his cell. And a former ETA leader reconnects with a close friend from his youth, now a filmmaker. 'Windows Looking Inward' gives a brief insight into the lives of the people behind the bars, behind the events, behind the headlines.","popularity":0.378,"poster_path":"/yVQNNUrUiiPew8lIZ0bT8epN4XH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2012-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Windows Looking Inward","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Ventanas al interior","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1381181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eneko Olasagasti","original_name":"Eneko Olasagasti","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55b788ab92514120e60022da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Txaber Larreategi","original_name":"Txaber Larreategi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55b78974c3a368227c00222b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1491236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josu Martínez","original_name":"Josu Martínez","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":"/lTAOrpWvqkTTbiUMTNL0QBcksNA.jpg","credit_id":"55b7898bc3a3682272002565","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1012183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enara Goikoetxea","original_name":"Enara Goikoetxea","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55b788c492514120e100249a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1204229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mireia Gabilondo","original_name":"Mireia Gabilondo","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55b788ddc3a3682288002414","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1204229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mireia Gabilondo","original_name":"Mireia Gabilondo","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbb02900e0a2615fdec7e75","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Txaber Larreategi","original_name":"Txaber Larreategi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbb029d92514108d1fb0039","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1381181,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eneko Olasagasti","original_name":"Eneko Olasagasti","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbb02a50e0a26105aeee67f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2292676,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Juantxo Sardon Altuna","original_name":"Juantxo Sardon Altuna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbb08b29251412577f4841e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1491236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josu Martínez","original_name":"Josu Martínez","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":"/lTAOrpWvqkTTbiUMTNL0QBcksNA.jpg","credit_id":"5cbb027592514108d8fb67fc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1012183,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Enara Goikoetxea","original_name":"Enara Goikoetxea","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cbb02809251410671f59d56","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":961475,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pascal Gaigne","original_name":"Pascal Gaigne","popularity":0.1424,"profile_path":"/g5xCHBiJCijuIdhp557a7Iikm4Z.jpg","credit_id":"5cbb089592514151caf5a8d7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2532662","wikidata_id":"Q20492090","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/yVQNNUrUiiPew8lIZ0bT8epN4XH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.691,"height":1295,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/f10iGBbsQd4ZY1gDFa76z4GBE2a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":895}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12346,"name":"eta terrorist group"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"eu","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
