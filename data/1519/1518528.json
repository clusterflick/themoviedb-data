If he borrowed your car, he’d return it washed with a full tank of gas. The problem is there’s nobody left in Fred’s life to borrow from. At 82, he’s desperately lonely, broke, and on the brink of homelessness. But Fred’s luck changes when, in a bizarre case of mistaken identity, he takes the place of grumpy Bernard Greer at the local nursing home.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":"/phOpbRLkluRmcp0oadOd0Jn1vC1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":268985,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Harp","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Borrowed Life of Frederick Fife","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5308059,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anna Johnston","original_name":"Anna Johnston","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68828eb7256e60aa3c52a35a","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":206410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noah Harpster","original_name":"Noah Harpster","popularity":0.2302,"profile_path":"/roJhr3RWlLcn4SZ3IJ43VsqSOX3.jpg","credit_id":"68828ee22d9055256dd9a13b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1161593,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Micah Fitzerman-Blue","original_name":"Micah Fitzerman-Blue","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68828ee9256e60aa3c52a361","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1161593,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Micah Fitzerman-Blue","original_name":"Micah Fitzerman-Blue","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68828ef63f67cfd7aa55e625","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":206410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noah Harpster","original_name":"Noah Harpster","popularity":0.2302,"profile_path":"/roJhr3RWlLcn4SZ3IJ43VsqSOX3.jpg","credit_id":"68828f0049f9a4e6ef72e1fc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2550,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/phOpbRLkluRmcp0oadOd0Jn1vC1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"},{"id":10325,"name":"mistaken identity"},{"id":15120,"name":"kindness"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
