It stars the French techno DJ I Hate Models navigating a dystopian New York City on the eve of the 2024 US election. Produced by Renegade NYC in collaboration with Apelago Agency, the piece blends narrative and documentary elements into a “visual sonata” that probes the fracture of reality amid political crisis. Hil Steadman’s cinematography and Mark Markevans Evans’s original score underpin its brooding atmosphere.
