A masked hunter emerges from the wasteland, dragging them into a sadistic game of cat and mouse. Is this a random act of violence, or something far more calculated?

stars.","popularity":0.0786,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":98124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rebel Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":269074,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monumental
