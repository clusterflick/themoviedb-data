She is placed on life support with only four days before her scheduled unplugging—just enough time for Alan to execute a desperate, terrifying plan.  When the hospital informs him that Josephine’s family will arrive from Florida for the final goodbye, Alan secretly builds a sterile surgical room in his home. He begins kidnapping healthy young women, harvesting their organs in cold, calculated procedures. Storing the organs in portable freezers, he delivers them to the hospital after midnight, one by one.  Alan then eliminates the entire graveyard shift hospital staff—taking advantage of the town’s small size—and begins an unauthorized, solo transplant surgery to replace Josephine’s failing organs.  Despite his efforts, Josephine dies, leaving Alan alone, bloodied, and broken in the wreckage of his own obsession.","popularity":0.3071,"poster_path":"/76huTraHcPSij88QwWGehPfu8aQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soprano
