The group began its activities in a period of increasing censorship and repression on the part of state apparatuses, responding with radical scenic expression in productions that sought to explore the process of theatrical creation. As a reflection of their artistic development, the group focused on themes related to the Amazon, in shows that were dedicated to demystifying the illusory euphoria of the Manaus Free Trade Zone, and studying indigenous cultures in depth. The TESC produced works that represent historical milestones in the expression and construction of Amazonian identity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/i3Cn0GezKLaBtzThiRi8SUnKW0O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":269000,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rizoma Audiovisual","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Amazon; theater","title":"Amazonian Stage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"A Amazônia como palco: uma história do teatro experimental do Sesc","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3259209,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gustavo Soranz","original_name":"Gustavo Soranz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6882a7ca22300a50a772dd9a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/i3Cn0GezKLaBtzThiRi8SUnKW0O.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1587},{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/oQQy7QHSSIZRZiUtwGwAITJUtUQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":959},{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/nueCjZVPJJDc6pqS77gfZ6emN9H.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":903},{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/et2wc18XyX74eCBP7FbHswnAVPD.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":753},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1684,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9TwzWc4c4q0jpuoYQkXPQ914D65.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":1191},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6gxyPuM06wuLeu0UDty2CAvEzKh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v1jLIWoHF8lryqDnBymLpho5zL5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9hr2VfAXXm6U01WnI2isD7Z3z3X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer A Amazônia como palco: uma história do Teatro Experimental do Sesc","key":"ubthUadjL8c","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-12-03T15:45:57.000Z","id":"6882a82e8b3b81d371245c12"}]}}}
