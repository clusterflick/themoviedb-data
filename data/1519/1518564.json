This film offers a heart-breaking glimpse into ground-level community-led resistance and solidarity, rallying against the industrial gaze of multinational and corporate profit. Ben Frost’s intense score is comprised of ultrasonic recordings of rainforest beetles, bats, and other lifeforms.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grid (Palimi-ú)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1693742,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Mosse","original_name":"Richard Mosse","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6882a0b3440b8c6121f77f6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
