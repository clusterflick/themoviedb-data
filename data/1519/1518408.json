The video begins on a midday highway stretching toward a vanishing point. Above scenes of surrounding vehicles maintaining steady distances and moving slowly in parallel, text reconstructed from online “meditation methods for drivers” flows across the screen.  As the sound of road friction expands and fills the ears, the body endures the compression of time and space while fatigue accumulates. The landscapes drifting outside the car window gradually pull consciousness into a flow. Scenes alternate between hurriedly transported construction materials, unaired news clips celebrating the opening of the highway, and a truck parking lot at midnight with engines idling—attempting an escape from the linear time running past past, present, and future.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Singing Highway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5584082,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moon Selin","original_name":"Moon Selin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68826230c74b327f5a38ee5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
