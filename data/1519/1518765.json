They would turn into deserts, devoid of life and vegetation. But there are very few mountains without water on our planet. They take care of this themselves, creating their lifeâ€™s element and taking water directly from the sky by entrapping the clouds around them. This water then collects on the flanks of the mountains, where it turns from rivulets into rivers, that flow out into the oceans. Mountains and water are symbiotic, a cycle that keeps life on earth going. Mountain streams slowly move along meadows before, only moments later, turning into the spray of waterfalls or small mystic lakes. What kind of life can be found in and around this mysterious cosmos?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8xmpTJMN14QPMnau9CBEIDNcdEh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Alpine Rivers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1300206,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sigurd Tesche","original_name":"Sigurd Tesche","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688352030213a4f73538f1b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8xmpTJMN14QPMnau9CBEIDNcdEh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
