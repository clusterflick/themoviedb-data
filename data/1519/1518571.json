And also to lose. Even though it seems impossible to get used to it. The three stories in this film are united by one theme - LOSS. Each of them has two characters: the one who suffered and the one who helps - a volunteer, a medic, a rescuer.  These stories take us back to 2022 to remind us of the ugly side of war, but also of the strength and courage of people. These stories were filmed and told by Roman Ostrovsky, a volunteer (and now a soldier of the Armed Forces of Ukraine) who has been to the most dangerous parts of the frontline.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clouds Move With Great Speed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5584614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Ostrovskyi","original_name":"Roman Ostrovskyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6882a5758af0071dab8a60ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
