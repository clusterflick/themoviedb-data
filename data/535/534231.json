The motley crew includes a maturing maid mad to marry, a discreet Irishman, a pompous bourgeois, and a mysterious lady in Renaissance attire who looks as though she's lost her castle.No matches made in heaven here; in fact, the characters seem bent on driving each other crazy before the tour's end.When the bus is attacked by highway thieves, and its occupants divested of jewels and money, the misadventure makes them accomplice ... a kind of spell is cast on these mere mortals, shaken from their moorings, who quit their banality and take off from the big bus into another space, outward bound.” — Joan Dupont","popularity":0.1158,"poster_path":"/wOMr4asDvmoqH13MnWKjDqIk6aA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81890,"logo_path":null,"name":"Skyline","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":102522,"logo_path":null,"name":"Go Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1995-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pullman paradis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Berling","original_name":"Charles Berling","popularity":0.3091,"profile_path":"/qn3eAS1Neh1sVhZRNxpvCiaBKUo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lucien Génin","credit_id":"627315118741c40066db1834","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yann Collette","original_name":"Yann Collette","popularity":0.141,"profile_path":"/mQ4gfKd8Z25m0nWS3SvFr8lpqie.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Thierry Daragnès","credit_id":"6273151d6f53e158ea282291","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ioana Crăciunescu","original_name":"Ioana Crăciunescu","popularity":0.1156,"profile_path":"/eKRnRb9SRQP5E5fMjveDulZQhJ0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Aurora Liceanu","credit_id":"627315257cffda7316c52f43","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2117140,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Basile de Bodt","original_name":"Basile de Bodt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/2d4iTqy3NFaKuwcwwzXeTpKLikm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jean-Roger Duchemin","credit_id":"6273152cb6cff100515718c7","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158024,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michèle Rosier","original_name":"Michèle Rosier","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3facb70e0a2626cf008cbb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0110911","wikidata_id":"Q48751345","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wOMr4asDvmoqH13MnWKjDqIk6aA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Shanghai International Film Festival","release_date":"1995-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
