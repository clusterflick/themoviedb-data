Today, the saccharine charm of these anti-modern fairy tales doesn’t work any more. But undistracted by the meaning or action of the film, we can enjoy the surface of Prunella all the better, the dazzling sets and costumes, silhouettes and painted backdrops created by the great art director Ben Carré in a fashionable Art Déco Neo-Rococo style.","popularity":0.135,"poster_path":"/zqKpSpbXChdAti7fsXz8dB3Q590.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Players-Lasky Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prunella","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1658947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite Clark","original_name":"Marguerite Clark","popularity":0.1396,"profile_path":"/a4ar2ciOc8ZFpibZntt4s5Car82.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Prunella","credit_id":"5b43d1cc9251414f6a021faf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2081363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel Berwin","original_name":"Isabel Berwin","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Prin","credit_id":"5b43d1bf9251414f4c023063","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":981098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nora Cecil","original_name":"Nora Cecil","popularity":0.52,"profile_path":"/cQa0cwlxAdqwU52dw05gpJB3RSH.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d617d6387f3f20015fce802","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1375359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William J.
