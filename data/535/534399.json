He has never wanted to get too close to people.  All this changes when he meets Norika, a beautiful woman who appears in his life almost by chance.  But she just as quickly disappears, leaving no trace.  Before he knows it, Tamás has been implicated in Norika's disappearance by her sister Annika, who claims Tamás had made a habit of following them.  Reality seems to shift based on each person's perspective, casting the nature of the crime into progressively murky territory.","popularity":0.1657,"poster_path":"/f1N3E2nHYiY0CY3tHSVysNTB4d6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2017-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strangers","video":false,"vote_average":6.583,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2213655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas
