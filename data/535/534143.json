The film seeks to show the role of politics and its practical effects on citizens' lives.\r A broad reflection emerges in the anonymous voices surprised at random in the crowd. They are ordinary people, from different professions, with different visions, who speak to the camera about their impressions, desires and frustrations, discussing politicians, voting, corruption, distrust and the future of Brazil.","popularity":0.0777,"poster_path":"/2lxMTWZf0RnO9dAaGmeHaXxFqZF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121949,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flashstar Filmes","origin_country":""},{"id":24121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aruac Produções","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2006-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Intervalo Clandestino","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eryk Rocha","original_name":"Eryk Rocha","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":"/ricZfFycFNUFPNabTO7F5rNOIQL.jpg","credit_id":"5b3f579a0e0a2626de006588","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eryk Rocha","original_name":"Eryk Rocha","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":"/ricZfFycFNUFPNabTO7F5rNOIQL.jpg","credit_id":"5d5592334bc38b1954249ced","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1377954,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lúcia Fares","original_name":"Lúcia Fares","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d55924de8131d3e2789c6e5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1377955,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tarcísio Vidigal","original_name":"Tarcísio Vidigal","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d559259e8131d3e3389c79d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1757843,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Flávio Ferreira","original_name":"Flávio Ferreira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d559268e8131d3e3689c6f5","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1373455,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pedro Urano","original_name":"Pedro Urano","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/hHqeQtggW28u8u3HubdXhnRXjPi.jpg","credit_id":"5d559272e8131d3e2789c732","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eryk Rocha","original_name":"Eryk Rocha","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":"/ricZfFycFNUFPNabTO7F5rNOIQL.jpg","credit_id":"5d55927d4bc38b1954249d42","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1764857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pedro Rocha","original_name":"Pedro Rocha","popularity":0.1313,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d5592bb4bc38b1954249db0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dGIF5O3mN38xnjriXUuRMViy79.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2lxMTWZf0RnO9dAaGmeHaXxFqZF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":511}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
