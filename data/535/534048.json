Miss Andrews and the two Americans cavort in some very funny slapstick, including a “Cinderella” take‐off of traditional English pantomime.\r Even a tender, dramatic vignette, with Miss Andrews and Mr. Van Dyke in a fogshrouded meeting during World War II, Works appealingly.  The songs flow almost continuously, enhanced by the muscular leaping of the Paddy Stone Dancers, clad as Covent Garden street workers. The ensemble finale is dandy, with a cavalcade of excerpts of songs from American hits at the Drury Lane, from “Rose Marie” to “Hello, Dolly!” Miss Andrews sings as beautifully as ever.  Blake Edwards produced, Dennis Vance directed, and Marty Farrell, Frank Waldman and Dick Hills wrote the program.","popularity":0.9056,"poster_path":"/zHwpiEH6xqK4HRNAl45oDgQ7irl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34703,"logo_path":"/pZ4IVMy5M2742GwXqBIE8EkQiOA.png","name":"Associated Television (ATV)","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1974-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Julie Andrews & Dick Van Dyke at Covent Garden from April 21,1974 with guest Carl Reiner.","title":"Julie and Dick at Covent Garden","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Andrews","original_name":"Julie Andrews","popularity":2.1535,"profile_path":"/yQ0J92DMiLtQYoytLJ6CuBkdeN0.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b3e8e390e0a2626d2001bab","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Van Dyke","original_name":"Dick Van Dyke","popularity":2.0643,"profile_path":"/qC352VsuULdYtHnATOSDjFbS6NC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b3e8e48c3a36866f000180d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Reiner","original_name":"Carl Reiner","popularity":0.571,"profile_path":"/hNZNrwU2qysa2ijndIgkd6yjSCt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b3e8e51c3a3686710001db8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1927,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Blake Edwards","original_name":"Blake Edwards","popularity":0.8926,"profile_path":"/tEUBu225EVmJKGxJSX936OvRet5.jpg","credit_id":"5b7d52090e0a263bdc011a95","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dennis Vance","original_name":"Dennis Vance","popularity":0.0619,"profile_path":"/wKB7W3yClkh7CdmsrvCBLlMf64W.jpg","credit_id":"5b7d52190e0a263bc700e583","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0368818","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":825,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A70W4L81iD4kvkNVb0ZAmwwXiAm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":590},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eXhihkc0Ii3pvGZyj58SMxDC1dY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":802},{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":975,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qzvnGjmgFMdx5tOrOffyW3NY6Bp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":694},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1042,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zHwpiEH6xqK4HRNAl45oDgQ7irl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":695}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
