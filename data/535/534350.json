His job as a publisher is going smoothly. Suddenly, out of the blue, his psychoanalyst, Charles, hits him with the news: his analysis is over. It turns out to be a nightmare. Charles also has his own dilemma: his actress wife is pregnant, but she hesitates to keep the child as she has an upcoming performance, and feels that she no longer loves Charles. Worse things comes as Simon receives a manuscript that portrays his private life and fetishistic desires, and his partner insists on publishing the novel. He blames Charles for writing the novel. On the other hand, Charles simplifies the matter, thinking Simon's misunderstanding is the reason that his wife leaves him. The two angry men have a big fight in Simon's home. Charles is wounded at the end. Now, Simon believes Charles and nurses him. Simon's mother drops by and suspects that Charles is Simon's gay lover.","popularity":0.3155,"poster_path":"/8JylPcikFaF6aRGBZydOfYBqyTD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man
