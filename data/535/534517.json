Few sailing vessels are surrounded by more myth and legend than the yacht Zaca. Launched on the eve of the great depression, the 118' gaff-rigged topsail schooner has sailed through 75 years of history from one remarkable adventure to the next. Zaca has served as a luxuary yacht, scientific research vessel, navy patrol boat and party boat for Hollywood swashbuckler Errol Flynn. This documentary offers a riveting window into the past as seen through the eyes of this historic ship and the survivors of those who sailed her. Produced and directed by Luther Greene.","popularity":0.2014,"poster_path":"/zW1HSNAEv8kpp0pmOcmLeFkERJ5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Remarkable Adventures of a California Schooner","title":"In the Wake of Zaca","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"In the Wake of the Zaca: The Remarkable Adventures of a California Schooner","type":"DVD Box Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrice Wymore","original_name":"Patrice Wymore","popularity":0.2878,"profile_path":"/eFdCOTBJjdQ7yLJ04A1OttN1uqx.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator / Herself - Co-Owner 1950-1965 (as Patrice Wymore Flynn)","credit_id":"5b419aff9251414f4f00e8a0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2029403,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luther Greene","original_name":"Luther Greene","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b419d4a9251414f5f00c867","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1607563","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zW1HSNAEv8kpp0pmOcmLeFkERJ5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":626}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"In the Wake of the ZACA: Trailer","key":"tajMU6x20nI","published_at":"2009-05-19T14:50:25.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5b419a560e0a26710100d28b"}]}}}
