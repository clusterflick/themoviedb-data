Sometimes they light each other up, sometimes they play hide and seek in the half-light. Both fireflies and butterflies, they start surprising nights choreographies that we only see in fragments. At the end their bodies get closer, in the dark, hesitating, sometimes backwards during a lively and retained dance. Yes, that night she danced, but did they really meet? The real film still has to be done.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eOYOMv8ut2sFCCfXloOlLbQpVUW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flamenc'co","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1431283,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Fouchard","original_name":"Olivier Fouchard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3PIJHz6MBl7z8bXFYC1tSuWecJ7.jpg","credit_id":"5b442c5b0e0a26710102456a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eOYOMv8ut2sFCCfXloOlLbQpVUW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
