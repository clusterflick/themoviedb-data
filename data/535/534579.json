Ann tries to get a bashful hotel clerk to marry her in name only, and then get a divorce, but he refuses to because he is in love with her. Her cousin then brings in another clerk and Ann now has two men on her hands. Ann now wants to marry the first clerk, having discovered she also loves him, but the aunts object. She then hires two gigolos to charm her aunts into a compromising situation.","popularity":0.3354,"poster_path":"/jkZhP04SqrKfJnPYAE1Vo0qJ3Le.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3245,"logo_path":"/9dBTQp9XitrHkx20i1r9HhZ3Q6B.png","name":"First National Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"1,404 sure laughs! 1,293 sure thrills! 1926 on the laugh pan - it's a knockout!","title":"Ladies at Play","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Kenyon","original_name":"Doris Kenyon","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/laM51FLnMQbtaSiAZYyUpd4ZRB7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ann Harper","credit_id":"5b421bd00e0a2670ff011487","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Hughes","original_name":"Lloyd Hughes","popularity":0.1403,"profile_path":"/ejZIGbXs0wObn0e9g7BlDF1JTTz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gil Barry","credit_id":"5b421bddc3a36840ab00c44a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Fazenda","original_name":"Louise Fazenda","popularity":0.3299,"profile_path":"/koJe4g2nqMB58S92UUV8Spa4fj4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Aunt Katherine","credit_id":"5b421bea0e0a26711a012367","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1016037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethel Wales","original_name":"Ethel Wales","popularity":0.1689,"profile_path":"/8TspAWWfu1IvRbQ46FrD9hJrtoO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Aunt Sarah","credit_id":"5b421bf8c3a368409c011315","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hallam Cooley","original_name":"Hallam Cooley","popularity":0.2308,"profile_path":"/q5JlfX2GWp9BmGEf6tohy12ejdB.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Terry","credit_id":"5b421c040e0a267122011bcb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1366755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Patrick","original_name":"John Patrick","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":"/unbrXri4ZptmB5kj1aS7SUr20Ru.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Andy","credit_id":"5b421c13c3a36840990143a6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1031280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Lee Corbin","original_name":"Virginia Lee Corbin","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/yf75lIGtaBhkRrcbTEQvFwHdJUN.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Dotty","credit_id":"5b421c200e0a2670f9011389","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1173173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philo McCullough","original_name":"Philo McCullough","popularity":0.2428,"profile_path":"/3rRW4z7GBHrXMzGNvTJldipaLBF.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Hotel Clerk","credit_id":"5b421c2dc3a368409c01132b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Ricketts","original_name":"Tom Ricketts","popularity":0.1217,"profile_path":"/66ezBnrNzoiL82VNBjo6NTAYHns.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Deacon Ezra Boody","credit_id":"5b421c3a9251414f66012945","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72063,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carey Wilson","original_name":"Carey Wilson","popularity":0.1307,"profile_path":"/pXnGTnHIJTFpHjGPFzFvmLBwoOD.jpg","credit_id":"5b421bc00e0a2671100129b6","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1367582,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sam Janney","original_name":"Sam Janney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b421bb69251414f6a011dd4","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97774,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfred E.
