Beginning with the star’s face projected on a large screen, mouthing the words to her #1 hit “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough,” the scene cuts to Miss Ross (draped in furs and jewels, of course) sauntering down a white, almost surreal staircase.  At the bottom of the stairs – during the joyous, climactic crescendo of the song  – she suddenly bursts from the screen and onto the stage, greeted by the screams and cheers of an overwhelmed audience.  Those lucky enough to be at these shows literally watched a superstar come to life before their eyes; incredibly, the impact is equally great when watched on a television screen decades later.","popularity":0.5222,"poster_path":"/bZePZPsreHlaVJTSoFSEqaKfOyK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Diana Ross concert at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas in 1979 is one of those legendary live shows.","title":"Standing Room Only: Diana Ross","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Diana Ross: Live At Caesar's Palace","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":32715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Ross","original_name":"Diana Ross","popularity":0.5803,"profile_path":"/3iIWzlwE2AdvHzaPS4siE6jijl4.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b43cf96c3a368408a027758","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":74611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tracee Ellis Ross","original_name":"Tracee Ellis Ross","popularity":2.8219,"profile_path":"/dIaX2VojiARhVpxDkOG9ozvsBB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b831c7292514159e702bc88","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marvin Gaye","original_name":"Marvin Gaye","popularity":0.1395,"profile_path":"/9Su0b4zeVTFCPiMesBb7Xv8goEO.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b831d59c3a368655503452a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1231281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhonda Ross Kendrick","original_name":"Rhonda Ross Kendrick","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/w9JhUZTSO31P8q4YZN6iLuKL6jP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b831daa92514159d902c330","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2115809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chudney Silberstein","original_name":"Chudney Silberstein","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/4Atf3YARnfdrclyZOBVzrR8DQU8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b831f6792514159e4030533","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marty Callner","original_name":"Marty Callner","popularity":0.1856,"profile_path":"/sejIEdA4ucYxUpfL9HxIzEM7fnq.jpg","credit_id":"5b89061f0e0a2679b90096fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2448496","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":838,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bZePZPsreHlaVJTSoFSEqaKfOyK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":590},{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":838,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5T5X8BFH9NecbPw7IupHBHEpCre.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":590}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
