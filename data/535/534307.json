This is something we cannot see. Not really. But somehow, we can, because we are being shown the interior and the roof of an empty-looking building: dark stairways, rooms, corridors and halls, along with glimpses of a metropolis at night in the background. Most of all, however, this film shows vibration: it is vibration. A phantom-like figure (in the end there will be two) moves through these spaces ditheringly, attached to bright filaments reminiscent of a gigantic web. Vibration pervades everything we are being shown here – all of the house and all of the image. It all jerks in a stop-motion-like non-movement caused by changes in the lighting.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Government House","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2079542,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herwig Weiser","original_name":"Herwig Weiser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3ff8fac3a368074100077a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9Kuzf5daUHdc4puBBH9AOCWswKv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Blicke Film Festival","release_date":"2018-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Message to Man International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
