Park’s films often had a strong female perspective and The Risky Road is no exception. The story of a country girl who comes to the city to work, but falls for a rich man and undeservedly gets a bad reputation, the film was marketed as “the drama every woman should see”. The surviving fragment, showing the despair of Phillips’s character, is a real cinematic gem that leaves one yearning for more material of the film to be discovered. In 2008, a tinted nitrate fragment, with Swedish intertitles at the opening of the second reel, was deposited at the Archival Film Collections of the Svenska Filminstitutet. From the fragment, a 35mm B&W duplicate negative was made, from which this print was struck using the tinting of the nitrate as color reference.","popularity":0.7657,"poster_path":"/uAyxWehKbZibZaOIezrfvPaWG2r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":88999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bluebird Photoplays","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Risky Road","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1196077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Phillips","original_name":"Dorothy Phillips","popularity":0.1,"profile_path":"/f9z3iAAzrKWjRkWlQ9V47tPsZi8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Marjorie Helmer","credit_id":"5b43d0810e0a26711d021a13","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Stowell","original_name":"William Stowell","popularity":0.156,"profile_path":"/fYVk4U0LqoHVWFhnT6UDO3hkqPL.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Melville Kingston","credit_id":"5cedeb6d9251410be2bb194d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juanita Hansen","original_name":"Juanita Hansen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/7MIPfbm7WNF09sM2O6NLplKJQd3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lottie Bangor","credit_id":"5cedeb73c3a36876ef1df3d4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68653,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Du Brey","original_name":"Claire Du Brey","popularity":0.3502,"profile_path":"/e8WDoA2IhvjkFMZ2OEsr7PinZEe.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Miles Kingston","credit_id":"5cedeb7bc3a36825e1205920","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Chesebro","original_name":"George Chesebro","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":"/s8A5WerpnAjIom4ezjiTEcDEOc4.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Robert Grant (as George Cheseboro)","credit_id":"5cedeb82c3a36805281df5a6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1017465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Cecil","original_name":"Edward Cecil","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Miles Kingston","credit_id":"5cedeb8bc3a36865611df156","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph W.
