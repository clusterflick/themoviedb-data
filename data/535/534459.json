Sergei Voronov comes to the floodplains of the Dniester to hunt. He is here for the first time, and he is recommended by the huntsman Vasiliy, nicknamed \"Newlywed\". In the evening, by the fire, the men started talking about wives. Voronov's cynical views cause a protest from Vasiliy. He wants to go home. With irony, Voronov agrees to let the \"Newlywed\" go until morning. When Vasiliy returns, Voronov is surprised to learn that the huntsman has been married for over ten years. Over the years, Vasiliy did not lose his youthful enthusiasm, falling in love with his wife. Therefore, his fellow villagers called him \"The Newlywed\".","popularity":0.1264,"poster_path":"/oDDW5YI3FA8iSPeIgBzPCws43K5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3161,"logo_path":"/p22GDJaOniIWidl1vPqzBv4qxFN.png","name":"Odessa Film
