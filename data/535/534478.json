A journey through and into Self, the constructed labyrinths of Ego, and the creative transcendence of the mind's physical limitations. Birth of BrainFly charts a surreal course of a psyche's evolution within the invisible landscape of the mind. The visual landscape is made up of a mélange of experiments in collage, live action, hand drawn, paint on film and multi plane.","popularity":0.4015,"poster_path":"/k4YS4cSOSFHGHxhGUQ1d42hFY3X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38413,"logo_path":"/qW9eadVJfNRx9jdZkuDxWR25RW6.png","name":"CalArts","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Birth of BrainFly","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2079951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nandita Kumar","original_name":"Nandita Kumar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614db1e4326ec100645bff2a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1122798,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chris Votek","original_name":"Chris Votek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614db23fe1faed008fbac0a7","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1870580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cara Elizabeth","original_name":"Cara Elizabeth","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614db1fd0328b900433858bb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2079951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nandita Kumar","original_name":"Nandita Kumar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614db1d1594c940042215f27","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1333598,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kari Rae Seekins","original_name":"Kari Rae Seekins","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614db21d534661002a894832","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3245941,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robin Sukhadia","original_name":"Robin Sukhadia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614db234e1faed0043d44c5e","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2079951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nandita Kumar","original_name":"Nandita Kumar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b412a4e9251414f610075de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k4YS4cSOSFHGHxhGUQ1d42hFY3X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1049}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":264722,"name":"sureal"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"tHE bIRTh of bRAiNFly","key":"10496163","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2010-03-28T08:46:58.000Z","id":"614db101326ec1008fcf5d2f"}]}}}
