After his mother's death, Khenan is taken by Najem to their Imuhar clan in the Sahara where Khenan learns the traditional rituals of their people from his grandfather Kenuni. During a camel race, Khenan's camel falls and must be killed. Filled with shame, Khenan runs away into the desert, and passing truckdriver Hamou returns him to the camp.
