Zischler, who also wrote a book of the same title, spent the next twenty-five years combing through archives and libraries to locate many of the now-extinct films cited by Kafka in his journals. The result is a witty conjecture on the Czech writer's fascination with film and Zischler's fascination with Kafka.","popularity":0.1212,"poster_path":"/vKHrtbU77a5WdUbpjVGe4SyBBEL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kafka Goes to the Movies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Kafka va au cin√©ma","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Kafka elokuvissa","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","title":"Kafka u bioskopu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1391590,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicolas Joly","original_name":"Nicolas Joly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c424760328b90183eadf18","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":55487,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Baute","original_name":"Christian Baute","popularity":0.0757,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c4248a55bc35014aabbeb0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanns Zischler","original_name":"Hanns Zischler","popularity":0.3326,"profile_path":"/5O4Dum1OuKI4RMB24xjACkL22iA.jpg","credit_id":"65c424aa99259c017da4e8b2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1797745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Fassbender","original_name":"Miriam Fassbender","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65c4249a0102c901635043b3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2927826,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter I.
