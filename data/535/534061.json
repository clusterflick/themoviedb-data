A sequence of vignettes that could loosely be described as sketches, most featuring large, naked women in a variety of \"hilarious\" situations, linked by a combed-over MC who laughs at his own jokes. Lots of prefab video effects, lots of disco music, lots of shot-on-video stupidity. Guaranteed to make your brain dribble out your nostrils.","popularity":0.1278,"poster_path":"/mEOuqO2I2xBmEBSdR1w7docX946.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bad Taste Movie No. 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2078938,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Karl Tosner","original_name":"Karl Tosner","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3e9f76c3a36867020021cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.648,"height":773,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mEOuqO2I2xBmEBSdR1w7docX946.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9964,"name":"crude humor"},{"id":245801,"name":"bad taste"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
