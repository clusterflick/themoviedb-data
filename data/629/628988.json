A straightforward testimony of scientific rationality, which led the society to a spiritual crisis and resulted in six genocides, is accompanied with melancholic Mahlerian echoes of La Belle Époque when the world was just getting ready for the century that negated all humanity. The film raises the question whether Europe in post-history and post-humanity, sweetly anaesthetized to collective unconsciousness, will pretend as if nothing had happened.","popularity":0.0904,"poster_path":"/if8uM4MRw6gPXRKv2F0nMMVCohe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Abacaris Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wishing You the Same","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Wishing You The Same","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Hoffe dasselbe für dich","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":584544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valérie Dréville","original_name":"Valérie Dréville","popularity":0.1354,"profile_path":"/iwEMdx7K5UeA3bjknGvUqmeJsoA.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5dd9797223bcf40bf34b662a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1407787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aliénor de Mézamat","original_name":"Aliénor de Mézamat","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5dd9797c23bcf40bf34b662d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2465431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ignace Steiner","original_name":"Ignace Steiner","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5dd9798523bcf40bf34b6636","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnaud de Mezamat","original_name":"Arnaud de Mezamat","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d71c81c84448e00142b2695","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2404844,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrik Ouředník","original_name":"Patrik Ouředník","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d71c82384448e1e292a57e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2465429,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pauline Le Duc","original_name":"Pauline Le Duc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd9795123bcf40bf34b6616","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2465430,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tomas Besson","original_name":"Tomas Besson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd9796723bcf40bf34b6622","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnaud de Mezamat","original_name":"Arnaud de Mezamat","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd9792c23bcf40bf34b6606","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnaud de Mezamat","original_name":"Arnaud de Mezamat","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd9795d23bcf40bf34b6619","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2404844,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrik Ouředník","original_name":"Patrik Ouředník","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd9791a23bcf40bf34b6603","department":"Writing","job":"Book"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291273,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnaud de Mezamat","original_name":"Arnaud de Mezamat","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dd9793a23bcf40bf34b660c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11374096","wikidata_id":"Q120606405","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uKPWKFNCzOfsXvVkVMTcRUI4X7K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":769,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/if8uM4MRw6gPXRKv2F0nMMVCohe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FIDBA (Festival Internacional de Cine Documental de Buenos Aires)","release_date":"2019-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Ji.hlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2019-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
