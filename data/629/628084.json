Helick hopes one day to pass on his South Philadelphia tailor shop to his son, Dovid. Their tense relationship stems from Helick's strict Judaic religious lifestyle. Using religion as a tool to hide from a dark past, he pushes his children away with his over controlling ways and neglects to show them love and care. In doing so, Dov impulsively runs away to aid in a drug smuggling operation in an attempt to prove his independence and finds that he has been manipulated and used for his tailoring skills to line drugs into suits. Trapped in the center of a world filled with drugs, sex and murder, Dov has no way to escape. With the absence of his son, Helick is forced ultimately to decide between his religion, or his family.","popularity":0.1849,"poster_path":"/vtgFewcR3dxeZQP4aMEy4I5F1aI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tailor's Apprentice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1664061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rowan Bousaid","original_name":"Rowan Bousaid","popularity":0.1262,"profile_path":"/qLHSRSr1dAHNexPd6Gl2dneAGCG.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dovid","credit_id":"672773629e0877d1d8af9469","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1001965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luke Guldan","original_name":"Luke Guldan","popularity":0.2013,"profile_path":"/bBeYCSMNQoWakVVunQZvn72F1Ia.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Aton","credit_id":"672773ba9e0877d1d8af94b8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1688491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Madison","original_name":"Antonio Madison","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":"/u9GSGaGNFWchtpKfmz0oTIwEpNb.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Blake","credit_id":"672774019e0877d1d8af94e1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1731337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Surely Alvelo","original_name":"Surely Alvelo","popularity":0.1084,"profile_path":"/x08N6NGlrpfCLW4Yna02Y7YP4rb.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Amber","credit_id":"67277473de69a78ba9642d8c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1757703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Armijo","original_name":"Phil Armijo","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":"/zjeNoTl56cFlUMoGjJDwMDAw71W.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Security Guard","credit_id":"67277556de69a78ba9642ddb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5038523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karlyn Koebe","original_name":"Karlyn Koebe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"672773ce9e0877d1d8af94cc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5038524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reed Kalisher","original_name":"Reed Kalisher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Howard","credit_id":"67277416c090109580f9d431","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1967521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefen Laurantz","original_name":"Stefen Laurantz","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Helick","credit_id":"67277381c090109580f9d415","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1673070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle Alagna","original_name":"Danielle Alagna","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Shawna","credit_id":"6727743bc090109580f9d44f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2616847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samantha B.
