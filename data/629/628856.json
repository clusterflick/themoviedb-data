Tu. Tu.","overview":"A student far from home, talks to his mother on the phone. The distance to the mother and the distance to the gardeners are the two weights in tension that start from the first window of the film, the first frame, through which we occupy our gaze. Distance works like a thread that binds us to someone, a phone call, for example, or the invisible thread that pierces the center of the Earth and joins me to the feet of whoever is on the other side of the mirror.\r Sound and image are understood in a dynamic of You + Me, elements that present themselves independently, each paying attention to a layer of perception. Were it not for Marcelo's relationship with sound, the biggest and warmest embrace, the most intimate and generous, offering, within the film, care and attention and, to those watching from the outside, the nature of the relationships that are shown to us.","popularity":0.0412,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73801,"logo_path":"/rgCuDxkHFEcRptf8BwaOtISoNzH.png","name":"Escola Superior de Teatro e Cinema","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2019-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tu.
