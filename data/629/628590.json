Topless mermaids. Crabs with human heads. These Chinese folklore-themed statues, in all their surreal, grotesque glory, are seared into the mind of Singapore's Haw Par Villa. But no one knows them as well as Teo Veoh Seng. Decades ago, he started out as an apprentice at the park, which opened in the 1930s; now, at 83, Teo has finally decided to retire. Though his successors prepare for his departure, what will be lost when the master craftsman steps down?  Interspersing interviews with animation, this documentary weaves personal and national histories into the portrait of an unlikely Singapore hero. It sheds light on an artisan whose quiet dedication has preserved a uniquely charming slice of a city hounded by rapid urban developments.","popularity":0.4072,"poster_path":"/3THktKYEfnrPd6qngnmLks9oEsu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Artisan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2403707,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Craig McTurk","original_name":"Craig McTurk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6fdb2377c01f10ee590c20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8998878","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"TheLastArtisan","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":"TheLastArtisan"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":873,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1gyrquS5XiYUaUwijPAqeBo9KhE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1552},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1330,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/62Hn4TCL4xgk0yELyr07Hp2GOwI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2364},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1181,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rX7AJEjZQ9jugzTJfOmfvRMXGg3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2099},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1222,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jTcEzYNyDRpGBQAy0WrjIHia3Wj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2171},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1222,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Af40rkabWmPCrCVhNIAv4MytfE6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2171},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1221,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nXitdlZILAG2xeGiqW29CMaCpl4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2170}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3THktKYEfnrPd6qngnmLks9oEsu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/djl9i9NxCpNEfGW73oImeTjcIlb.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iWQhnmmBWGL73jPv3uCewqkNQHj.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1112,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ngpNeh8D75Mzysi38IEToUcr55b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":742},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1112,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/guyUYSnry2aXHNDPmPah0AuHhL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":742}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4224,"name":"singapore"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Asia Pacific Screen Award","release_date":"2019-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Singapore International Film Festival","release_date":"2018-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vimeo On Demand","release_date":"2020-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Last Artisan Trailer | SGIFF 2018","key":"HGw_ct26qtw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-10-23T03:00:00.000Z","id":"5d6fcdcae22d286f2eb4ed47"}]}}}
