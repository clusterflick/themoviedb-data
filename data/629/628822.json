Faced with extreme patriarchal laws in an ancient seaport kingdom and denied the legal custody of her infant son Sudhir, Saudamini becomes a pirate declaring war on the state, and especially on its tyrannical minister of justice, Durjaya (Chandramohan). She attacks a royal ship and captures Durjaya, inadvertently also taking Princess Nandini (Apte). In captivity, Durjaya declares his love for Nandini but she falls for a shepherd boy (Nandrekar) who turns out to be Saudamini's long-lost son Sudhir. Durjaya's men then capture Saudamini and a palace intrigue ensues marked by her emancipatory rhetoric and the universal humanist arguments of her adviser Shekhar (Kale).","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1936-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Immortal Flame","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1936-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
