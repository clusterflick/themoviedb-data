In the years since, it's become increasingly clear that the deep roots of racism and white supremacy continue to run through our political, cultural, and religious institutions. Based on interviews and current research, the documentary film White Savior explores the historic relationship between racism and American Christianity, the ongoing segregation of the church in the US, and the complexities of racial reconciliation. Featuring interviews with Lenny Duncan, Soong Chan Rah, Jacqueline Woodson, Jim Bear Jacobs, Dominique Gilliard, and more.","popularity":0.0849,"poster_path":"/lI6LZst0VhoQO6aUqo8eLL2x8Ug.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Savior: Racism in The American Church","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashe Jaafaru","original_name":"Ashe Jaafaru","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5d6d737665686e0917878bb5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402156,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aaron J.
