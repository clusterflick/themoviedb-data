Four artists are finishing a workshop in a palace in Northern Spain as they recall a strange incident that happened to two long-time married couples who got lost nearby years before. After a dream-like walk in the mountains, the couples, strangers to each other, arrived in a mythic burial place called Sad Hill, where they had to face the naked facts of their hollow marriages in a totally new psychological light. The wives started the same walking ballet as did Clint Eastwood, Lee van Cleef and Eli Wallach in Leone’s film. In a few minutes, the lives of the couples would change completely.","popularity":0.0504,"poster_path":"/dLfygKNkAmsL26Yxu8tqtTAehBc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94649,"logo_path":"/tuFCuMT4dLXZKmfTT0y8JKpTS6s.png","name":"Bad
