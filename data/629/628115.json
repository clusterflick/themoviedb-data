Her name was Maria. Her children, we, Raúl and Santiago, discover among the objects left by our mother hundreds of photographs from our maternal grandfather, from REGINA -our great-aunt-, from our mother, from our father... And through those photographs, and with the help from an old camera -my grandfather's inheritance-, I, -along several trips to the places where those photographs were taken-, seek to recover and not lose my memory... that of my family. In the end, we will have to think on our memory and on what we have preserved and lost.","popularity":0.1961,"poster_path":"/xUknmfpZnpP8nMbGoD5yoQUfN3q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122592,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bidaiak Cooperative","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2020-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Has Been Lost","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santiago Solera","original_name":"Santiago Solera","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d6d6b5c20ecaf0d052a378f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raúl Solera","original_name":"Raúl Solera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d6d6b63a284eb4732333cfd","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santiago Solera","original_name":"Santiago Solera","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6d6b6e2faf4d0012ac154d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santiago Solera","original_name":"Santiago Solera","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6d6b772faf4d0011ac1666","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Santiago Solera","original_name":"Santiago Solera","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6d6b9165686e52e7878255","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402150,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jorge Río Esteban","original_name":"Jorge Río Esteban","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6d6b9c20ecaf343929c0d5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raúl Solera","original_name":"Raúl Solera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6d6c0befcea900149ba99d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402150,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jorge Río Esteban","original_name":"Jorge Río Esteban","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6d6c28a284eb01bf3334e4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402151,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adrián Berenguer","original_name":"Adrián Berenguer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6d6c392faf4d0011ac16ed","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12239470","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"BRINGTOLIGHTSOLERA","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xUknmfpZnpP8nMbGoD5yoQUfN3q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":679}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3371,"name":"family history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER LO PERDIDO/WHAT HAS BEEN LOST","key":"299666036","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-11-08T14:28:04.000Z","id":"5d6d6c52efcea900129bac84"}]}}}
