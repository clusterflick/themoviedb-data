An actress undertakes her desire of directing her first movie, without a budget or any production company funding her project. She gathers a group of  professional actors and actresses, and proposes a project based on a very particular experience: stepping on their fears through a metaphorical 'leap of faith'. As the project advances, individual  conflicts will arise affecting the shoot, making the movie crew wonder whether or not they should go on.
