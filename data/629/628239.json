Disabled by arthritis since the age of four, confined to a wheelchair, his growth stunted, Stoney St. Clair joined the circus at 15 as a sword swallower. A year later he took up tattooing, and traveled with circuses and carnivals for fifty years practicing his craft. As we watch him at work, we see the determination which led Stoney to use his crippled hands in an art where mistakes are permanent, and we realize Stoney has overcome his handicap to heal himself and others with the magic of symbols. The film ends with a visit by New Age tattoo master Don Ed Hardy, who receives a permanent souvenir by Old School tattoo master Stoney.","popularity":1.2306,"poster_path":"/ropFnkRq7Zi2wV1h7QyBwnXT7Ii.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stoney Knows How","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonard 'Stoney' St. Clair","original_name":"Leonard 'Stoney' St. Clair","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d6e110365686e24f08790ba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Ed Hardy","original_name":"Don Ed Hardy","popularity":0.0954,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d6e1119a284eb473233cadd","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2402571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pacho Lane","original_name":"Pacho Lane","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6e1132efcea900149c4018","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0121769","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ropFnkRq7Zi2wV1h7QyBwnXT7Ii.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1062},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1064,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cpLv9TQ9IHiAp6dlGdZt7mhG8xC.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":709},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1028,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k8KbeqBpi5UOzHIUuVtEOqafCs9.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":685}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":331,"name":"tattoo"},{"id":163204,"name":"tattoo artist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1981-11-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Stoney Knows How DVD trailer","key":"aZNNPYyBMrc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-06-26T16:46:15.000Z","id":"62a9c2727e12f00e271977f5"}]}}}
