The ship's boatswain, the hiding communist Mikhail Gruzdev, convinced Captain Chistyakov to keep the Eagle and return it to the red flag. Soon the legendary ship aboard the White Guards pursued by the Red Army left Novorossiysk.  History left no trace of the further fate of the \"Eagle\" and its crew. It was believed that Chistyakov handed over the ship to the White Guards, and they took him abroad. Many years later, the captain of the ship “Flounder” Mikhail Gruzdev, confident in Chistyakov’s uncompromising attitude, obtained permission - and set about searching for the missing ship.","popularity":0.2208,"poster_path":"/tXj57ew823zIIj7Pdr8l7y3ujja.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15444,"logo_path":"/pdfT1FpxrxjsWnVEJ88XpyBmc1I.png","name":"Soyuzdetfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1941-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Disappearance of \"Eagle\"","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1461692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolai Annenkov","original_name":"Nikolai Annenkov","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":"/o8A5FZbY8BpeUAbmgFo8cWMlU03.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d6e09f2a284eb01bf33bc21","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Viktor Gromov","original_name":"Виктор Громов","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/q9ORjrQxjQmGU5A72o235AY4REc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5d6e09f6efcea91e0a9b0d0e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergei Stolyarov","original_name":"Sergei Stolyarov","popularity":0.2238,"profile_path":"/6bozjY7ul7kmfT7904jsd2Mf3f7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d6e09ff65686e24f08787f4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":593088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Troyanovsky","original_name":"Михаил Трояновский","popularity":0.1478,"profile_path":"/ava6oR3xprgaPYoIlRVW4vI4Iqg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5d6e0a0665686e5b9b8a204c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":593091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lev Fenin","original_name":"Лев Фенин","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":"/ehMmGgkLAMUyo8o6u7cFAQv2qVb.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5d6e0a1ba284eb473333c642","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrey Fayt","original_name":"Андрей Файт","popularity":0.208,"profile_path":"/cMlf0uUGzc6Ds7db9G0VZDCH693.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5d6e0a2265686e2bc5878718","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1337144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pyotr Sobolevsky","original_name":"Пётр Соболевский","popularity":0.0923,"profile_path":"/urytNZueqCXcO3pj65hxyPUFJAv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5d6e0a2aefcea959189b0a15","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Bobrov","original_name":"Ivan Bobrov","popularity":0.1875,"profile_path":"/yCHbMMtSGOYzn5O7FfaTncYsSBw.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5d6e0a41efcea900129c33c5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Grechany","original_name":"Alexander Grechany","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5d6e0a51efcea900129c33da","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolay Gorlov","original_name":"Николай Горлов","popularity":0.0638,"profile_path":"/8UzCR6bVwHU2ehwscqbAWZGJlFz.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"Иван Петрович -
