On the one hand, 1937, at the height of the Stalinist purges in Erevan, in the then Soviet Armenia, the year of the arrest of Nora Dabagianâ€™s father who was a political dissident. On the other hand, 2006, the circumstantial story of this arrest related by the old woman, affectionately known as Baboulia, who was a very young girl in the 1930s. The tense question between these two sides is how to transmit all this and what images and sensations should be conveyed?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1937","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1785824,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nora Martirosyan","original_name":"Nora Martirosyan","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/315WfRSPaicma2z0OeFgJkvp0xc.jpg","credit_id":"5d6fd0fae22d28000fb54bcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
