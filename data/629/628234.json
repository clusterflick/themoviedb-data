The main character of this film is a projectionist who, 37 years ago, used to carry his old projector on foot and bicycle. He would display a small screen across the road or between trees in front of a farm... It's the same today except that he rides a motorcycle, carries a large screen and that the films travel two thousand kilometers from Beijing to Chengdu by satellite, before he picks them up on his motorcycle. Up in the mountains, people bring a stool out on the road and watch. That story takes place in Beijing and the beautiful mountains covered with bamboos above Chengdu","popularity":0.0461,"poster_path":"/3751XFbRDRJSg2w5kGPQIdV4OFz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15790,"logo_path":null,"name":"BelAir Media","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":17121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tita Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"He Film","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"He Fu Quan","original_name":"He Fu Quan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d6e0b5aa284eb01c033c33f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liliane de Kermadec","original_name":"Liliane de Kermadec","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/naoXiH19ijv2aK3KpzMiyIqXaMl.jpg","credit_id":"5d6e0b32efcea959189b0adc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":238582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Liliane de Kermadec","original_name":"Liliane de Kermadec","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/naoXiH19ijv2aK3KpzMiyIqXaMl.jpg","credit_id":"5d6e0aecefcea900129c348c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2041365","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3751XFbRDRJSg2w5kGPQIdV4OFz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8AprZnlE9Q45CvezT6eo70nb5mf.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
