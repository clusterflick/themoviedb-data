The libretto was based on the play by Camillo Federici (1791) and a previous libretto by Giuseppe Checcherini for Carlo Coccia's 1807 opera, Il matrimonio per lettera di cambio. The opera debuted on 3 November 1810 at the Teatro San Mois√® in Venice  Composed in a few days when he was 18 years old, La cambiale di matrimonio was Rossini's first professional opera. The overture, written when he was a student at the Liceo Musicale in Bologna, is an important part of the modern concert repertoire. As was to become typical of his later career, the duet \"Dunque io son\" was later reused, to greater effect, in act 1 of The Barber of Seville","popularity":0.0832,"poster_path":"/sncFlVhdk8ezttL0aTGzx06yJ6A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La cambiale di matrimonio","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1949022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vito Priante","original_name":"Vito Priante","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":"/4DdT3wlpfKUYuThNskywp41AjhZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tobia Mill","credit_id":"5d6e164ba284eb473233cfe3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julija Samsonova","original_name":"Julija Samsonova","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Fanny","credit_id":"5d6e1651a284eb473233cfee","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniele Zanfardino","original_name":"Daniele Zanfardino","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Edoardo MIlfort","credit_id":"5d6e1657a284eb000f33f8c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2402583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giulio Mastrototaro","original_name":"Giulio Mastrototaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Slook","credit_id":"5d6e165f65686e24f08796a1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomasz Wija","original_name":"Tomasz Wija","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Norton","credit_id":"6153439de18b9700628cdf7c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesca Russo Ermolli","original_name":"Francesca Russo Ermolli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Clarina","credit_id":"615343b7fab3fa0042c3568f","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2246468,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christopher Franklin","original_name":"Christopher Franklin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615344de43d9b10062327823","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3251159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annette Hornbacher","original_name":"Annette Hornbacher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"615344f843d9b10087dce6b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sncFlVhdk8ezttL0aTGzx06yJ6A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
