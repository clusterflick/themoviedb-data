All of this was Brodsky's Leningrad. The biography, which was written for, in Akhmatova's words, \"our red-head\". On the fourth of June 1972, when the plane carrying Brodsky took off from Pulkovo airport, this biography ended. And a new life began that almost no one in his homeland is aware of. Russia, America, Italy, Sweden, Finland - the filmmakers have traced the journey of their hero, perhaps the most well-traveled of all Russian writers. The places, that became his biography. And the people, that defined his fate.","popularity":0.2222,"poster_path":"/rQwTgFBw2QElY7iQSKWyEQrlUEd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2016-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brodsky Is Not a Poet","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Brodskiy ne poet","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Brodski nie jest poeta","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201852,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joseph Brodsky","original_name":"Joseph Brodsky","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"5d493fe5a0be287cfda2231b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1839319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilya Belov","original_name":"Ilya Belov","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/2J2nzOoeY6rT548yuI7YkfDnfRO.jpg","credit_id":"5950c0d39251412ac7005341","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2380148,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mariya Koiro","original_name":"Mariya Koiro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d49401aa0be287cfda223a8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1839321,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anton Zhelnov","original_name":"Anton Zhelnov","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/cMlb4Z1IR3Z8SsJw3Pj0OWYFnpN.jpg","credit_id":"5d4940462d1e405082c28f93","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2380146,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rafael Bulatov","original_name":"Rafael Bulatov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4940542d1e40192cbedcd6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1839320,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikolay Kartoziya","original_name":"Николай Картозия","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/1TfdZTyIhFLqdLlbhfWDrT4Xd2N.jpg","credit_id":"5d49403c028f1400110191c0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1992087,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dmitry Selipanov","original_name":"Дмитрий Селипанов","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/lOT2RedY0dHMt8zByvPPFTfh21o.jpg","credit_id":"5d494077a0be287cf6a21d72","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1839320,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nikolay Kartoziya","original_name":"Николай Картозия","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/1TfdZTyIhFLqdLlbhfWDrT4Xd2N.jpg","credit_id":"5d494080a0be2841a3a25485","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6298708","wikidata_id":"Q21636490","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rQwTgFBw2QElY7iQSKWyEQrlUEd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":998,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8lH8dRFaCxp8BKVM7oePL13EYDx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":665},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":998,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/2ehKc6ehouMuj2Tq0AMkKCqn6XU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":665}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sputnik Russian Film Festival","release_date":"2016-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAILER BROIDSKY IS NOT A POET ENG","key":"226794771","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-07-24T19:13:04.000Z","id":"5d4940fba0be2841a3a255b2"}]}}}
