While sightseeing, Clara—a beautiful, surprisingly childish young woman—loses her hat in a sudden gust. As if guided by an unseen hand, the hat lands at the feet of Fabrizio Naccarelli, a handsome Florentine, who returns it to Clara. This brief episode, charged with coincidence and fate, sparks an immediate and intense romance between Clara and Fabrizio. Margaret, extremely protective of her daughter, attempts to keep Clara and Fabrizio apart.","popularity":0.9683,"poster_path":"/4bjLV7q79llePSUUsPpEcFWwBcl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108696,"logo_path":"/gJs5yAYYjJvO2f5RX51vlRL610G.png","name":"Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I know what the sunlight can be...
