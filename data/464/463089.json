The film focuses on what The Otolith Group describe as ‘an experience of watching in the key of listening’, invoking political feelings of defiance and the collective practice of movement building that participates in the global struggles against neoreactionary authoritarianism. The Third Part of the Third Measure invites viewers to attend to exemplary ecstatic aesthetics of black radicalism that Eastman himself once described as ‘full of honour, integrity and boundless courage’.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/aiEU9BDlodjDDePUIWPCmUhS25p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Third Part of the Third Measure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2118127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elaine Mitchener","original_name":"Elaine Mitchener","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5b87a3380e0a266f2b00a944","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2118128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dante Micheaux","original_name":"Dante Micheaux","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5b87a34ec3a3681fe5009824","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2118129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zubin Kanga","original_name":"Zubin Kanga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5b87a362c3a3681fec00b7b0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2118130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eliza McCarthy","original_name":"Eliza McCarthy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5b87a37f0e0a266f34009e90","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2118132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf Hind","original_name":"Rolf Hind","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5b87a3950e0a266f230098dd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2118133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siwan Rhys","original_name":"Siwan Rhys","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5b87a39c0e0a266f2900ad71","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2118126,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Julius Eastman","original_name":"Julius Eastman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b87a296c3a3681fdd00ab87","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2118134,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kate McDonough","original_name":"Kate McDonough","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b87a3b7c3a3681fe00083bd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483673,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Simon Arazi","original_name":"Simon Arazi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b87a3cb9251412d3800b118","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1DD3QRSGuaa7nHWLO3HoM8sORlA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aiEU9BDlodjDDePUIWPCmUhS25p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sharjah Biennial 13","release_date":"2017-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
