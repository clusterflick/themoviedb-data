You'll start out learning chords and strumming patterns so you can sing and play along. The songs are demonstrated slowly, phrase by phrase with split screen close-ups so you can see exactly how to play them. Then you'll learn how to add the melody to your chord strums to create lead solo arrangements for a variety of familiar songs. By the time you're finished, you'll learn hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides, tablature, rhythm patterns, arpeggiated rhythm, endings, and more.  Bass and rhythm guitar accompaniment is provided for songs at normal speed and at a slower speed so you can play along. A handy case size booklet is included with exact transcriptions of songs and playing techniques in tablature.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/iliqbWdLCPeBUEYehp3yDwB30SW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beginning Acoustic Guitar","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":897,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iliqbWdLCPeBUEYehp3yDwB30SW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":639}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
