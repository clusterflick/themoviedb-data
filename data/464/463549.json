With exclusive access to the archive of the show, documenting the scandal in the words of the people who lived it: from the botched burglary at the Democratic National Headquarters; to the must-see TV of the daily Congressional Watergate hearings; to the ongoing behind-the-scenes battle between the White House and “The Dick Cavett Show,” culminating with the resignation of President Nixon on August 9, 1974. Offering a unique opportunity to mark the 40th anniversary of a defining moment in American history.","popularity":0.8105,"poster_path":"/mLXwnqEBpWrcYQDbOmHK4mb2sgk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89194,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crew Neck Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":91795,"logo_path":null,"name":"Daphne Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10492,"logo_path":"/3fcHNVpW66wgG6o0cgFJlcP8cCg.png","name":"Thirteen","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Revisit the Watergate drama through the lens of Dick Cavett.","title":"Dick Cavett's Watergate","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dick Cavett","original_name":"Dick Cavett","popularity":0.4865,"profile_path":"/7g5J47vQY2k4GzGhlJr6KdYm04P.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59517169c3a3680d7300f394","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Naftali","original_name":"Tim Naftali","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5951717dc3a3681498011449","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Bernstein","original_name":"Carl Bernstein","popularity":0.2081,"profile_path":"/hsybFvd3kiZnu6w2Nu6YYqJ2KZj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59517189c3a36814ae012023","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1839700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John W.
