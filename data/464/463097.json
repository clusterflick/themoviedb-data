No longer as active as they once were, these trails still bear the signs of the techno-fictional—overlaid with ancient spiritual regimens. As computers proposed that machine activity could replace the mind, counterculture considered whether religious or mystical experience could be recreated through technical means, as customisable 'internal technologies'. This decay of the ‘Empire of Equilibrium’—the once-aspired-to state of universal harmony—exemplified by psychedelic posters, cheap reworks of surrealist paintings and local mixes of religio-techno-fusion music, forms the central audio-visual schematic of the project.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cool Memories of Remote Gods","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mochu","original_name":"Mochu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594d23d9925141311f025da5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
