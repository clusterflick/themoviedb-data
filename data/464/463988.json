At its narrative core is the Ditrupa, a celebration of military history held in Markapanstad, rural North-West â€“ a filtered-down appropriation of Scottish tradition brought back by black South African troops who served in the Great War. As well as covering black military history, the film provides a telling juxtaposition of black memory against white history. Its portraiture of the craft and history of Diturupa, it needles in on an uncomfortable nostalgia that may be a basis of inquiry for future films on the subject.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qhJuRbi5ryeWbmq0ni7zrNBAXQw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Troupes of War: Diturupa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dfznZHuTtOTTPRNIai7VvAeJYe5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":2480,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qhJuRbi5ryeWbmq0ni7zrNBAXQw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1748}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Encounters South African International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2017-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
