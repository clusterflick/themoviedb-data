It all amounted to one of the most successful third-party bids in U.S. history; Perot won 19 percent of the popular vote.","popularity":0.1747,"poster_path":"/3kJUUZ7DdAikKgJIKx62DOiTEss.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":240677,"logo_path":null,"name":"FiveThirtyEight","origin_country":""},{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ross Perot Myth","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1246835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eamon Harrington","original_name":"Eamon Harrington","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594e7c7cc3a36832ad0382d1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1181917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Watkin","original_name":"John Watkin","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594e7caa925141311f0399f4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1181917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Watkin","original_name":"John Watkin","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594e7cb992514131110395c2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1246835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eamon Harrington","original_name":"Eamon Harrington","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594e7d16c3a368329b03e546","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1181917,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Watkin","original_name":"John Watkin","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594e7d23925141311f039a5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11685530","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3kJUUZ7DdAikKgJIKx62DOiTEss.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":631},{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p3legJHfSoYbtzEWnFae9eHWBd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":631}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2946,"name":"presidential election"},{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":15134,"name":"election"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
