Six years later, after numerous delays and costing close to €30million, the NGI finally reopened the historic Dargan and Milltown wings in June 2017.  This special observational documentary film secured unique access inside the walls of the National Gallery of Ireland, the nation’s most visited cultural attraction, while the institution goes through huge change. Three and a half years in the making, director Adrian McCarthy and Wildfire Films observed the day-to-day running of the institution while witnessing the transformation of the dilapidated historic Dargan and Milltown wings. A mammoth challenge for architects Heneghan Peng, the OPW and the construction team as they renovate a protected 150 year-old and 110 year-old building, while also opening up new spaces never-before-seen by the public.","popularity":0.0654,"poster_path":"/bmj59lMGcCLcR4ghBvNwanyinjf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wildfire Films","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÉ","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2017-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"RTÉ One unveils National Gallery documentary as part of its upcoming collection","title":"Portrait of a Gallery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1840500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Rainbird","original_name":"Sean Rainbird","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sean Rainbird","credit_id":"595368eb9251412ac40345e8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":73115,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martha O'Neill","original_name":"Martha O'Neill","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"595368059251412ac403450e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1836772,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Brenda Morrissey","original_name":"Brenda Morrissey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59536811c3a368352601855d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1666913,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian McCarthy","original_name":"Adrian McCarthy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"595367f6c3a368138803659e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lrogWTczU1B72ba3OKD00u8a2JC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hQB1WPuJyfvQZUI8CDmX6D6tz5X.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uCokjNxRkVhMzJQXPhkkZpsNlH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8SsGhZ3HvvXQ0i0LGfwQZEiFzM7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bmj59lMGcCLcR4ghBvNwanyinjf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Portrait Of A Gallery | RTÉ One |  Tuesday 27th June 9.35pm","key":"-CHhrh4d4us","published_at":"2017-06-21T10:49:29.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"5953672dc3a368151c02f640"}]}}}
