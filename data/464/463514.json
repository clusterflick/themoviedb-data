These are moving narratives of persecution, discrimination, marginalisation, of life as second-class human beings, all of which lasts, incredibly enough, right up to the allegedly democratic present day of the film, since they live in inhumane conditions in barracks at the margins of cities and society and are not officially recognised as Nazi victims. Long, nearly uncut sequences open space for the people and their stories. That’s all it takes for one of Peter and Zsóka Nestler’s most important works.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/izEBmWTfvY7KRnMF3TjfC6oWJZE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1970-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Being Gypsy","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Zigeuner sein","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zsóka Nestler","original_name":"Zsóka Nestler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e68128a55c926001364fa68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zsóka Nestler","original_name":"Zsóka Nestler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e681291cee2f600159712eb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Nestler","original_name":"Peter Nestler","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/atMWUqn7yzoHv95r1PFUcaeRouK.jpg","credit_id":"5e68129c55c92600176396b4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Nestler","original_name":"Peter Nestler","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/atMWUqn7yzoHv95r1PFUcaeRouK.jpg","credit_id":"5e6812a455c926001364fa78","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Nestler","original_name":"Peter Nestler","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/atMWUqn7yzoHv95r1PFUcaeRouK.jpg","credit_id":"5e68132e25a5360014ca3cd6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1043257,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Nestler","original_name":"Peter Nestler","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/atMWUqn7yzoHv95r1PFUcaeRouK.jpg","credit_id":"5e68133455c9260015636f43","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0370305","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aOWZsZJc7cCWRdIbKPphEcPcso8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/slwivEMtMLFVC8p9bt9cO11EevF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/izEBmWTfvY7KRnMF3TjfC6oWJZE.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kQ2Q3a2OTfeX8pIid6rMW2gop0v.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
