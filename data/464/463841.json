The director is obsessed by filming marginal events in life. The closer he can get to these events with his camera, the more he becomes involved with them. In the end he falls victim to them. The film, with no dialogue and hardly any sound, is an experimental meditation on the complex, continually-changing relationship between a film-maker and his subject.","popularity":0.0936,"poster_path":"/de1rYGTvGIUFEblYDf7kHmMGUPi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127655,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mzhalala Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wooden Room","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Derevyannaya komnata","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2507553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatyana Verkhovskaya","original_name":"Татьяна Верховская","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1a7837459ad60014362093","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1602400,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vladimir Maslov","original_name":"Vladimir Maslov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1a78481d820f0017269120","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2251904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Igor Bezrukov","original_name":"Igor Bezrukov","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/cpuWEAfJayfP2zxvhb6d6MnTnl7.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1a78601d820f0017269159","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2496235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Tsvetkov","original_name":"Sergey Tsvetkov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1a786a1d820f0015267159","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2346232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vasili Deryagin","original_name":"Vasili Deryagin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1a78741065d30014288eb1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2145868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Kuzmin","original_name":"Denis Kuzmin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1a787e1d820f0015267189","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1602400,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vladimir Maslov","original_name":"Vladimir Maslov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"595499bc9251411dbd0288a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1602400,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vladimir Maslov","original_name":"Vladimir Maslov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"595499c8c3a368352602a85e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":555501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evgeny Yufit","original_name":"Evgeny Yufit","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":"/8hBGhZcmMfeQcoJLSMwn0Z5jbSn.jpg","credit_id":"595499d19251412ac7049e2e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":555501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evgeny Yufit","original_name":"Evgeny Yufit","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":"/8hBGhZcmMfeQcoJLSMwn0Z5jbSn.jpg","credit_id":"595499d99251412ac40486ba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2507547,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Roman Lugovskoy","original_name":"Roman Lugovskoy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1a7636459ad60016360a2d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2507548,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Angelika Artyukh","original_name":"Angelika Artyukh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1a76421065d30016288cf5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":555501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evgeny Yufit","original_name":"Evgeny Yufit","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":"/8hBGhZcmMfeQcoJLSMwn0Z5jbSn.jpg","credit_id":"5e1a764f1e9225001577f258","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2507549,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mikhail Podtukai","original_name":"Mikhail Podtukai","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1a765f459ad60014361d88","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0114978","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/de1rYGTvGIUFEblYDf7kHmMGUPi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
