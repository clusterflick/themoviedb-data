I had but one idea: to return to Beirut as quickly as possible and to begin shooting a film, for historical moments were taking place. This film became indispensible: to film so that history would cease repeating itself and to build up a picture library for future generations.

The war surely merited more attention.\" (Waël Noureddine)","popularity":0.2149,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2006-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"July Trip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Waël Noureddine","original_name":"Waël Noureddine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5951679bc3a368151c00ecbd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1034039","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":236275,"name":"lebanese civil war"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
