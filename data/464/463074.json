This site is also home to the last remaining wild population of endangered Puerto Rican parrots, Amazona vittata, who make their habitat in the surrounding Rio Abajo forest. Allora & Calzadilla collaborated with science fiction author Ted Chiang on a subtitled script that explores translation as a device to trace and ponder the irreducible gaps between living, nonliving, human, animal, technological, and cosmic actors. In the spirit of a fable, the subtitled story presents the bird’s observations on humans’ search for life outside this planet, while using the concept of vocal learning—something that both parrots and humans have in common—as a source of reflection upon acousmatic voices, ventriloquisms, and the vibrations that form the basis of speech and the universe itself.","popularity":0.0742,"poster_path":"/1WDTLVH6YvrzalBSVgkFsu14vjf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Silence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1646469,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ted Chiang","original_name":"Ted Chiang","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":"/qq5lMzGHqFRDnJrerOeTbGxcMDe.jpg","credit_id":"63a3011f2f3b170085dd6ce6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jennifer Allora","original_name":"Jennifer Allora","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594d13c6c3a368328b02170e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1837877,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guillermo Calzadilla","original_name":"Guillermo Calzadilla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5afab411925141419600797e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1WDTLVH6YvrzalBSVgkFsu14vjf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":546}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://www.artsy.net/show/redcat-allora-and-calzadilla-apotome?sort=partner_show_position","release_date":"2014-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
