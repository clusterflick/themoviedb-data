Reality’s Invisible could be described as a portrait of the Carpenter Center, yet it is a portrait of an extremely idiosyncratic and distinctive sort. Fulton moves us through the concrete space of the Center’s Le Corbusier-designed building—the only structure by the architect in North America—but, more centrally, presents us footage of students making and discussing their work alongside figures like Gardner, theorist Rudolf Arnheim, artist Stan Vanderbeek, filmmaker Stan Brakhage, and graphic designer Toshi Katayama.","popularity":0.1603,"poster_path":"/46AmOvEymYgUXlt3yrysw2rhUu7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reality's Invisible","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2337948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rudolf Arnheim","original_name":"Rudolf Arnheim","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d04083cc3a368445b28e3d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan Brakhage","original_name":"Stan Brakhage","popularity":0.2583,"profile_path":"/jqpZxCtg17kcJl51zDDzCjFUPGj.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d09c12c0e0a267fe0cc09f2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331150,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Fulton","original_name":"Robert Fulton","popularity":0.0657,"profile_path":"/dyzMR7dtY5fyoyccAVfcoiqN4np.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself (voice)","credit_id":"5d040790c3a368489e2190fa","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1601664,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Gardner","original_name":"Robert Gardner","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ba76438c3a3680e5002800b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfred Guzzetti","original_name":"Alfred Guzzetti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d04080d92514162bcc0f029","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2341927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toshi Katayama","original_name":"Toshi Katayama","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5d09c13bc3a3683dd8201e1f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1065323,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard P.
