The boy -- or at least his dreams -- seem like they could provide a recurring framing device for Walt Phillips' third film (following \"Sunset Surf Craze\" and \"Surf Mania\"), but that's the last we see of the boy or hear of ambitions. \"Psyche Out\" contains less poetic musing, travelogue, comic relief or similar stuff characteristic of surf films of the time, in favor of surf action at Malibu, Point Zero, Rincon and Steamer Lane. This is to the benefit of the film.","popularity":0.2305,"poster_path":"/gQQ6gGZQcMuaTFU6N3UJnGDp9aG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1962-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Psyche Out","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1840596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lance Carson","original_name":"Lance Carson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/rmuGf4Ry5MgDunJEv7asMsZxZqU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59538c669251416914008261","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1840600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Skip Frye","original_name":"Skip Frye","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/pbSJ1x3VdfqeIdOOqyPjwLVQ3ss.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59538cc1c3a368352601a4d8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Hynson","original_name":"Michael Hynson","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59538cd19251411d98016761","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1840602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Doyle","original_name":"Mike Doyle","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59538ce092514169140082ce","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1391969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kemp Aaberg","original_name":"Kemp Aaberg","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59538cf09251412b31037eef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Fain","original_name":"Johnny Fain","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"59538d089251412b23035d6d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1840594,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walt Phillips","original_name":"Walt Phillips","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59538c3cc3a368151c03169b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xQHMS46NVsohiyI42j7Q44qtjjc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gQQ6gGZQcMuaTFU6N3UJnGDp9aG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5349,"name":"surfing"},{"id":9828,"name":"surf"},{"id":195239,"name":"travelogue"},{"id":208992,"name":"1960s"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1962-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"DVD","release_date":"2008-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Sunset Beach Walt Phillips' \"Psyche Out\" 60's surf movie","key":"BCSJVtRek4c","published_at":"2008-02-24T06:34:23.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"59538e5bc3a36809c6037a64"}]}}}
