Street life alternates with bouts in the reformatory, and Betty's prospects for a decent life seem fairly dim in spite of her consistently ready wit and ability to take whatever life hands out. Then she meets a social worker willing to add Betty to her already heavy case load. Maybe there is some hope after all, as two against the world double Betty's odds.","popularity":0.0951,"poster_path":"/79loasjoLBhrCZvrf4TuTqmgF0q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl from Millelire Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Monti","original_name":"Maria Monti","popularity":0.266,"profile_path":"/u7hhoohnJriuap3r6ysKRU9HnrF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Verdiana","credit_id":"5aef4d0bc3a3681424004ee4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2037570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oria Conforti","original_name":"Oria Conforti","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Betty","credit_id":"5aef4d3c9251417664005b77","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1395046,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianni Serra","original_name":"Gianni Serra","popularity":0.0728,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59503e09925141311105392d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0081396","wikidata_id":"Q16570710","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/tFYLZDZG0zVPcsVaiMuoknTZgwi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1429,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/79loasjoLBhrCZvrf4TuTqmgF0q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
