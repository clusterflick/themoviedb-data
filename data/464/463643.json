The piece features an ensemble cast of 15 actors, each individually recorded and then edited together sentence-by-sentence to create a spoken word experience that activates the power of the mindâ€™s eye. As the drama unfolds, the image slowly transitions from pure black to blinding white throughout the duration of the film.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/9msG13nBmYwCo0Svzic8H62hJdH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":215,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Republic","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1115073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nour Mobarak","original_name":"Nour Mobarak","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/3FCB3bkCFHQlokG5UFysUPFhxGh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Linda/Narrator","credit_id":"59529bf792514129c402607c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1840176,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Aroya","original_name":"Anthony Aroya","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/jkFfPQRqnRDgiwGx59T8r4Wy9N9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gavin","credit_id":"59529c30c3a36813880279db","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1840167,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Schavoir","original_name":"Robin Schavoir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"595297df9251412a9b026874","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1273973,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James N.
