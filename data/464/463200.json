The open unfolding structure, which pulls away from the balanced design of much of my work, gives equal weight to the sound composition. Involves \"opening\" with its perils and ambiguities.","popularity":0.069,"poster_path":"/riwb90ZGM9VFvANOPK3ZzXCLDSi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Red Thread","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1195101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Gottheim","original_name":"Larry Gottheim","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/y6YJWdMk6006kMVK1CwZXWtD713.jpg","credit_id":"594e62d2c3a368329b03ccf7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7006422","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aXocfnXTBQTndYZY4PfLYFCPAVs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":848},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/riwb90ZGM9VFvANOPK3ZzXCLDSi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":848},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":927,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9EDBPvO2GtKdcqbPev0OmFCq7V4.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":618}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
