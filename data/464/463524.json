The plot is a typical Graustarkian affair, with Princess Eva (Harvey) preparing to marry a duke whom she's never met. Getting cold feet, the duke ducks the wedding, persuading a handsome young commoner named Bobby (Willy Fritsch) to take his place. The wedding goes on as planned, with Eva never suspecting that her new hubby is a ringer. Eventually, the false duke confesses everything, leading to all sorts of intrigue before a happy ending can be realized. Love Waltz was simultaneously filmed in an English-language version, which posed no problem for the British-born Harvey but caused a few uncomfortable moments for her Teutonic co-stars (eventually, Willy Fritsch was replaced by John Batton, who'd played a bit role in the German version).","popularity":0.2794,"poster_path":"/2nRqaXZbgScDo2BNaUMVkFHUQLV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12372,"logo_path":"/lcQScIQXHQXuLMLFQt0loJl5gWJ.png","name":"UFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1930-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Love Waltz","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilian Harvey","original_name":"Lilian Harvey","popularity":0.1596,"profile_path":"/hkEO3LYFOgu7tGVQLzc5ZpbV0w1.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Princess Eva","credit_id":"59513b9c9251412ac700dd3d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Alexander","original_name":"Georg Alexander","popularity":0.0914,"profile_path":"/uhNaGN0dnzMitrXtJSX9eOi7x5S.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Grandduke Peter Ferdinand","credit_id":"59513ba8c3a368134a00d233","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Batten","original_name":"John Batten","popularity":0.0825,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bobby Fould","credit_id":"59513bbac3a36809c600dc18","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":50894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrud de Lalsky","original_name":"Gertrud de Lalsky","popularity":0.1333,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Grandduchess Melanie","credit_id":"59e272cdc3a3687c2800418f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Ludwig Diehl","original_name":"Karl Ludwig Diehl","popularity":0.154,"profile_path":"/dy2l9pNMzd8MrsDjY4yyGPrXvnb.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Lord Chamberlain","credit_id":"59e272d7c3a3687bdd0042f5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Junkermann","original_name":"Hans Junkermann","popularity":0.1974,"profile_path":"/4prEypLmJGo74ofqsgHABBipUuj.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Fould, Bobby's Father","credit_id":"59e272e0c3a3687c500044a8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1905830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilian Mower","original_name":"Lilian Mower","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Duchess zu Lauenburg","credit_id":"59e272e992514163b30041ff","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"C.
