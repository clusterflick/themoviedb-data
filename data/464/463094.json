Some images were captured in the moment ‘without quite knowing why’, and others were filmed at an earlier time ‘with no apparent motive’ or as a result of specific circumstances. Salhab jotted down notes all along, excerpts from books he read or reread, sounds he recorded and preserved. He approached this film essay as a work in progress with no preconceived structure; instead, he let the work gradually reveal itself. All at once, in terms of ‘place’ and his relationship to ‘here’, with all its entanglements, it became clear to him that he needed to invoke the ‘elsewhere’, to start with the first place, his childhood in Senegal, and ‘retrace’ certain steps: his connection to armed struggles, the Palestinian cause, the present moment.","popularity":0.1129,"poster_path":"/hYqQAmEjt8mE5Dx9urXhUST9bJG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2016-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chinese Ink","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Schattenspiel","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211415,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ghassan Salhab","original_name":"Ghassan Salhab","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/AMjWu692MmLvNJQVbpvv3AlwCf.jpg","credit_id":"594d21d39251413155026587","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6117458","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":795,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hYqQAmEjt8mE5Dx9urXhUST9bJG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
