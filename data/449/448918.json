She attempts to commit suicide, but gets distracted by a large pimple on her nose. Being obsessed with how others view her, the discovery of her pimple sets Nuknik on a journey into the imperfections of the world and herself, where she battles with the core of her existence.  With slight horror elements, this experimental film is a mirror for the modern viewer to recognise our restless state of anxiety, the constant preoccupation with our self image, and the vicious cycle of being caught up in our self-absorbed neurosis.","popularity":0.0692,"poster_path":"/w1T5oUEPcp3OltawRh3WMsfsIyr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Morning Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2013-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beauty is more important than life","title":"From a Pimple to Nirvana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","title":"Phee poh sadue pood lae siw khong Nuk Nik","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1015811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Atthama Chiwanitchaphan","original_name":"Atthama Chiwanitchaphan","popularity":0.1286,"profile_path":"/Auo6D9pFWwunFP6NxD2IaN3obKl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64007230699fb700e6fe1cdc","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amorn Harinnitisuk","original_name":"Amorn Harinnitisuk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640071b8699fb700c64abfa4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4133126","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w1T5oUEPcp3OltawRh3WMsfsIyr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":672}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"th","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
