Kelly Coffey also features easily-intensified exercises that let you increase the weight or impact levels as you get stronger. The programs are very straight-forward. The aerobic intervals range from high-impact jumping jacks to low-impact repeaters (sometimes holding dumbbells to maximize fat-burning). The toning intervals are exceptionally time-efficient. They feature compound exercises where you're working multiple muscle groups at once (fast-changing, usually only 12 reps per routine). As always, Kelly's cuing is friendly and positive. DVD includes a short bonus stretch segment.
