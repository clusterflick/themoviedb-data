Through this process Moffatt unites the graphic punch and suggestiveness of the still image with the satisfaction of a complete movie narrative. In the end, its only a movie.  ‘Love’ embodies Moffatt’s desire to create work that has an ‘international look’ and deal with ‘universal predicaments’. 'Love' is both parody and pastiche, critical comment, and wryly humorous.","popularity":0.118,"poster_path":"/uzhch7bmKJYsOL4dUUWZGgk6BtI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1121253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tracey Moffatt","original_name":"Tracey Moffatt","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/yVHCfGmY488q8BUkJSk8VEH7otd.jpg","credit_id":"58d2bd019251411f90001fcb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uzhch7bmKJYsOL4dUUWZGgk6BtI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
