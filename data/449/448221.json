The blend of techniques adds interest while challenging your body in different ways (e.g. an arm-and-core functional fitness move that advances into a classic all-arm routine and ends with a hammer curl/squat compound exercise).\r In addition, many of the “traditional” exercises are intensified with subtle position and angle modifications.
