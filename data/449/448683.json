In the story, Dolphy has a half-brother (Navarro) who is based in London. One day, a package was delivered to him and since it was huge, he remarked: “Ang bait naman ng kapatid ko, nagpadala pa ng refrigerator.” The ref turned out to be a coffin and when Dolphy opened it, there was Rod Navarro — deader than dead. I consider that a master stroke because from comedy, the audience was engulfed within moments by a horror scene that was scary.","popularity":0.16,"poster_path":"/tNzqB43nTFeiW2tcvrkLSj7GsRs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1973-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drakula Goes to R.P.","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dolphy","original_name":"Dolphy","popularity":0.4758,"profile_path":"/gCBeLme2seGqWzTCRy1VBW4EDGz.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"58d4bec492514103d200f938","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1360065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rod Navarro","original_name":"Rod Navarro","popularity":0.1021,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"58d4bed19251411faa025840","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1414594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pugo","original_name":"Pugo","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/8qR7M0PcLOq7LDMcMzyInEpPUGj.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"58d4bedb9251411f890265b7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1782836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maritess Revilla","original_name":"Maritess Revilla","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"58d4bee69251411f810263c5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1319159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Panchito","original_name":"Panchito","popularity":0.3114,"profile_path":"/7FFuUfRQUCUlbNzkekSeZ7QHn6l.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"58d4beef9251411fc5025c37","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1544,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bram Stoker","original_name":"Bram Stoker","popularity":0.4923,"profile_path":"/qJR6jc8hSFZyyZbthfZPi2QU40U.jpg","credit_id":"58d4bf2b9251411f81026501","department":"Writing","job":"Characters"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1477307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Cayado","original_name":"Tony Cayado","popularity":0.105,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58d4beff9251411fd5026048","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1360752,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ading Fernando","original_name":"Ading Fernando","popularity":0.0902,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58d4bf159251411fc5025d02","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1207935","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"tl","file_path":"/tNzqB43nTFeiW2tcvrkLSj7GsRs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3133,"name":"vampire"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"1973-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
