After getting into an argument with his teacher about the name of his river (she says Rio Siapa; he calls it Periquitos), Pepiwe decides to return to the jungle to look for his family. He paddles down the Orinoco with his dog and parrot, and during a stopover on land he meets yet another nun (Flor Núñez), but not one from his mission. She pays the boy to show him the way to San Carlos de Rio Negro (by the Colombian border). He reluctantly agrees, but after a day's journey the nun tries to sneak away and loses the canoe.","popularity":0.1482,"poster_path":"/9T5YKWRlBbFOaDxIlcQoOW7Epmc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11692,"logo_path":null,"name":"Da Fondo de Fomentos Cinematograficas de Venezuela","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"1985-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ya Koo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1800664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jose Gregorio Payema","original_name":"Jose Gregorio Payema","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Pepiwe","credit_id":"58fa0cc4c3a3687c8600a286","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1800665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arantza Fuentes","original_name":"Arantza Fuentes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sor Albertina","credit_id":"58fa0d09c3a3687c7300b630","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1021375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flor Núñez","original_name":"Flor Núñez","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/rKzBcM7vSI3aglMrRihN3beVNO6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"58fa0d1ac3a3687c3100b089","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1800667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilio Fuentes","original_name":"Emilio Fuentes","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Padre Emilio","credit_id":"58fa0dd792514158c600beea","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franco Rubartelli","original_name":"Franco Rubartelli","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/wwDZKc5hdgQG4MxNxOgjhNUfUS7.jpg","credit_id":"58fa0d3592514158c600be58","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franco Rubartelli","original_name":"Franco Rubartelli","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/wwDZKc5hdgQG4MxNxOgjhNUfUS7.jpg","credit_id":"5b9c11afc3a368377a0009a5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1820293,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francisco Molo","original_name":"Francisco Molo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66eab9695168a896e11f5962","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0090344","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8qvrIfvqhSWXj0fKbKTV4N7kbAF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9T5YKWRlBbFOaDxIlcQoOW7Epmc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
