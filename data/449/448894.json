Block opens the show with Freddie Martin's first big hit, \"Tonight We Love,\" an adaption of a Tchaikovsky piano concerto; he dedicates it to a listener in Wyoming, and we see her daydreaming as she listens. Then Keenan Wynn stops in for a chat, asking Block about being a DJ. Between bits of conversation with Wynn, Block plays three more Martin records, including \"Cumana,\" and we see the band in action.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Martin Block's Musical Merry-Go-Round #1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1869575","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1948-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
