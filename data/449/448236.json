They're designed to help you do everyday activities with comfort and confidence. Kelly's well-planned sequencing makes them easy. First, she includes lots of between-move stretches (e.g. a \"superman,\" then a stretch, then a modified \"superman\"). Second, she maximizes results by combining complementary routines (e.g. pairing a pelvic tilt with a torso rotation to strengthen your back and loosen your hips at the same time). It's all taught in a straight-forward, \"fitness style\" manner â€” not dumbed down or \"medical.\" Note: the second workout is re-edited from the first.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eR6L6eIN6g6iGOqI0qwP9UVtnlU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"30 Minutes to Fitness Your Healthy Back","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eR6L6eIN6g6iGOqI0qwP9UVtnlU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":717}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
