The film is an eye-opening look at how the camp saved the army – and the American Revolution – from the brink of disaster. Based on John T. Cunningham’s book The Uncertain Revolution and shot on location at Morristown National Historical Park, Morristown: Where America Survived is narrated by award-winning actor Edward Herrmann, who has voiced many history documentaries over his extensive career. The program was produced by New Jersey Network.","popularity":0.5547,"poster_path":"/6B2EYZveQ2e7dsRRI0ZKXm8vwM4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Morristown: Where America Survived","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Herrmann","original_name":"Edward Herrmann","popularity":1.0067,"profile_path":"/sO9IoAlw3CLJZT6UF35cZBcTYRV.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"58d061c5c3a368674f000189","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6B2EYZveQ2e7dsRRI0ZKXm8vwM4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2020,"name":"revolution"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
