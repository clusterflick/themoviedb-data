Trees are ablaze with colour, and their splendor is reflected in the mirrored surfaces of the water, offering a glimpse of the landscape Lampman knew so well through the poet’s eyes and words. Lampman’s poem is read by broadcaster and poet George Whalley, with accompanying score by composer Eldon Rathburn.","popularity":0.4572,"poster_path":"/1gHUIVxlcpjJsaci4Htb36Mf1Ja.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1961-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Morning on the Lièvre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1782217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Whalley","original_name":"George Whalley","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"58d358779251411f9000bd41","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1087078,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Croll","original_name":"George Croll","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1a447a410c812385cc824","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3073533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bairstow","original_name":"David Bairstow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1a44066ae4d0096b6a68f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1087078,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Croll","original_name":"George Croll","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1a44ecb71b800896c4c5c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1333771,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guy Glover","original_name":"Guy Glover","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63d1a42955b0c000a8a87a9e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bairstow","original_name":"David Bairstow","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58d358409251411faa00b5c6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1352218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Bairstow","original_name":"David Bairstow","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58d35822c3a368128900bdd2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":957757,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eldon Rathburn","original_name":"Eldon Rathburn","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ead096b66469a00245cd972","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1782216,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Grant Crabtree","original_name":"Grant Crabtree","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67981e405dc8b3b72d2ae452","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0226158","wikidata_id":"Q66069451","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1gHUIVxlcpjJsaci4Htb36Mf1Ja.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":496,"name":"poetry"},{"id":1261,"name":"river"},{"id":3356,"name":"quebec"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
