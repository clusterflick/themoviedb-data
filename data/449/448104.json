After their first encounter, Holden's attempt to return Green's thought-to-be stolen purse ends up rendering him a stowaway on board a ship bound for America. Also aboard is a collection of characters, including Green's banker fiancé, a famed scientist, and an opera singer. Romance begins to blossom between Holden and Green, just as a radiogram claims that an “infernal machine,” or bomb, is aboard the ship. Quickly each passenger accuses the others of planting the bomb until eventually Holden, jealous of Green's attention to her undeserving fiancé, falsely admits to being the culprit.  In his role as assumed perpetrator, Holden tests the group further.","popularity":0.8021,"poster_path":"/hlXBP5G2wgyn3BIDVtgAWmWu6GR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"With one kiss he stole a rich man's fiancèe and rescued a ship from an explosion that never happened...what a man!!!","title":"Infernal Machine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chester Morris","original_name":"Chester Morris","popularity":0.2935,"profile_path":"/fzWrhccpVX6UWBZjEutjvQ3qV92.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Robert Holden","credit_id":"58d0bf5dc3a36838c90052ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":81167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Genevieve Tobin","original_name":"Genevieve Tobin","popularity":0.1432,"profile_path":"/hQsXALJakpFOOvd6T7inVJLs2Lo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Elinor Green","credit_id":"58d0bf729251411ab50055db","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Jory","original_name":"Victor Jory","popularity":0.5098,"profile_path":"/6H3Qr1HcKNEp9p3ZNUqs1YQ1aeW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Alfred Doreen","credit_id":"58d0bf89c3a36838af0052ba","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":83237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Patterson","original_name":"Elizabeth Patterson","popularity":0.2303,"profile_path":"/rSLcM8DsZi1ydRn8Dk3vXE89nCG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Elinor's Aunt","credit_id":"58d0bf9ac3a36838af0052f6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Van Sloan","original_name":"Edward Van Sloan","popularity":0.1392,"profile_path":"/qZ9zAlgNlJ1vefUXb4KDVbC3kVh.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Professor Gustabve Hoffman","credit_id":"58d0bfa99251411adc00578c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josephine Whittell","original_name":"Josephine Whittell","popularity":0.0641,"profile_path":"/e2oIrJY3nBHndblhN4dPjWIsAVe.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mme.
