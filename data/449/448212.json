The moves are straight-forward classics like squats, leg lifts and pushups. Kelly maximizes their effectiveness with smooth transitions, a fast tempo and a large range of motion. She also integrates some more challenging movements and more intense body positions (e.g. an angled lunge or a wide-stance pushup). The two programs are very different — the first is all standing; the second is all floorwork. Both workouts target each muscle group with multiple exercises.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xDHpxlx68NmDglsjXoWumuZEsUj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"30 Minutes to Fitness Body Training","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.695,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xDHpxlx68NmDglsjXoWumuZEsUj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":695}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
