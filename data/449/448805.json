Stephen Port date-raped and murdered four young gay men in East London within fifteen months and dumped all four bodies within a few hundred metres of each other.  The film tells the story through eyes of the families of Port's victims, unpicking how the police failed to properly investigate each of the deaths in turn. The police's assumptions that these young gay men had died from self-inflicted overdoses of chem-sex drugs allowed Port to continue raping and killing innocent young men.","popularity":0.0778,"poster_path":"/tkBbnprqPYIlQdnUAUzaY1iyx8n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20639,"logo_path":"/qypOd6AlNrfHIXN9nArZmyMv6do.png","name":"BBC Northern Ireland","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Police Missed the Grindr Killer","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1783185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Walters","original_name":"Lisa Walters","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"herself,narrator","credit_id":"58d5a695c3a368127c0307d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1783187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Port","original_name":"Stephen Port","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"58d5a6f19251411fd50325b6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1783188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Taylor","original_name":"Jack Taylor","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"himself","credit_id":"58d5a71fc3a368125f030b2f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1783189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Whitworth","original_name":"Daniel Whitworth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"himself","credit_id":"58d5a74492514103d201bf6e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1783191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriel Kovari","original_name":"Gabriel Kovari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"himself","credit_id":"58d5a765c3a3681289032573","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1783192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Edwards","original_name":"Ryan Edwards","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"himself, former neighbour","credit_id":"58d5a7e69251411f89032e73","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1783193,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Pape","original_name":"John Pape","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself - Gabriel Kovari's Friend","credit_id":"58d5a817c3a368126702d962","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":92588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Grandison","original_name":"Steven Grandison","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58d5a887c3a368124f0313d1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":92588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Grandison","original_name":"Steven Grandison","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58d5a8b89251411f81032a82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6549558","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tkBbnprqPYIlQdnUAUzaY1iyx8n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9826,"name":"murder"},{"id":10714,"name":"serial killer"},{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BBC Three","release_date":"2017-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"How Police missed the Grindr Killer","key":"uUGR1B652iw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2021-09-13T04:29:00.000Z","id":"62eaeea4ea84c700613a5099"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Grindr Serial Killer: Stephen Port's Murders","key":"iMPAKrwHmSg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":true,"published_at":"2016-11-24T14:34:58.000Z","id":"62eaeed7f1b571005e2c8eae"}]}}}
