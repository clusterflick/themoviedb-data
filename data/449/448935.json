The gang boss was shot and, before succumbing to his wounds, proclaims Baek-chon to be his successor. Per his chief's final instructions, Baek-chon makes each member of the gang sign a document in blood declaring the rules of conduct of the gang. First and foremost is that no one will deal in drugs. Naturally, all of this doesn't sit well with Hyun-tae, another gangster who resents Baek-chon's rise to power and seeks to exploit the lucrative nature of narcotics. Hyun-tae plots to kill Baek-chon, a plan that ultimately fails but sees Baek-chon sent to jail for manslaughter after defending himself. While in jail, Baek-chon befriends one of Hyun-tae's underlings. When both men are eventually released from jail, Baek-chon seeks to avoid conflict but when Hyun-tae murders his friend, Baek-chon seeks his revenge.","popularity":0.0613,"poster_path":"/nMOELwMKbaOdwI3zyhGmktDbqkH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nationwide Constituency","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"National Constituency","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Jeonguggu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dragon Lee","original_name":"Dragon Lee","popularity":0.4814,"profile_path":"/bi9MgM5dt5KrEuCd0Hs2UErW7SF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"58d6a5979251411f900434f0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1783553,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Jin-yeong","original_name":"Lee Jin-yeong","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"58d6a5a4c3a368123404094c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1136493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Hyeon Gil-su","original_name":"현길수","popularity":0.1225,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5ba2a9070e0a261f9a00c37a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1783557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Won Yeong-ae","original_name":"Won Yeong-ae","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"58d6a5b69251411f8904352e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1783558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hwang Chun-Su","original_name":"황춘수","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"58d6a5bfc3a368124f0411be","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3034711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Lee Jae-Yeong","original_name":"Jerry Lee Jae-Yeong","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/ypIiQUgYXCW8BJqUtZU9YqQHa2Z.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Takuchi","credit_id":"6079d02466f2d20040b0384d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2290694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sim Jae-Cheon","original_name":"Sim Jae-Cheon","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Choe Ryu-Tan","credit_id":"6085b53e960cde006f0b634b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3052132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Seon-Do","original_name":"Kim Seon-Do","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Yeo-Po","credit_id":"6087fbfe55c9260078280bbb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3035172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Jae-Gyu","original_name":"Lee Jae-Gyu","popularity":0.0627,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Jug-Po","credit_id":"60891ec2904f6d005882d21c","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kwon Il-Su","original_name":"Kwon Il-Su","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58d6a52392514103d202c71d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kwon Il-Su","original_name":"Kwon Il-Su","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58d6a56dc3a368125f040848","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":755,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nMOELwMKbaOdwI3zyhGmktDbqkH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":505}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"1991-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
