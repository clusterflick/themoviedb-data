The film spells out the troubling legacy of the Balfour Declaration,  challenging the notion that this yearâ€™s centenary is cause for celebration, given the grave consequences of the document for Palestinians above all.  The film goes on to explain how the decisions of the British government in 1917 are linked to the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, its fifty year occupation of the West Bank since 1967, and today's political gridlock. 100 Years After Balfour features seven experts and activists: Professor Avi Shlaim, Professor Jacqueline Rose, Rabbi Howard Cooper, Professor Brian Klug, Antony Lerman,  Barnaby Raine and Miri Weingarten.","popularity":0.1351,"poster_path":"/zf2paKZltw04Q4cPrfsz1tp8t6G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":234283,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Jewish
