As she instructs him through a series of social behaviors a connection is formed between them. This film asks the question: can genuine connection happen within artificial circumstances? Human Resources was created as part of a filmmaking workshop program designed and produced by Lost Forty Studios. It was designed to give newer filmmakers hands-on production experience and was led by a seasoned, Minnesota-based production team. This program is a presentation of UMFO in partnership with Minnesota North, the IRRRB, and Advance MN.","popularity":0.1689,"poster_path":"/mCR66rvsZ3yysTy5tHOH9wh7mYH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Help me fill in the blanks.","title":"Human Resources","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Rains","original_name":"Lily Rains","popularity":0.2505,"profile_path":"/vRBVh3D4S9jSTabiQLSsf7fUsk3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"669963f11241a7d8cd184f0c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1211650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Casey E.
