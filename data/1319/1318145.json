On a bucolic, tree-lined stage designed by Es Devlin, and accompanied only by her brother FINNEAS (co-winner of the Songwriter of the Year Award) on piano and guitar, she reimagined songs from throughout her meteoric career. The stark arrangments and intimate venue only highlighted her charisma and power. While \"bad guy\" and \"bury a friend\" may have been everywhere in 2019, they feel new and revelatory here-the perfect showcase for an artist who defined the year but clearly won't be held down by that definition.","popularity":0.0668,"poster_path":"/5ogc86eKk4FULqd6xDxxEAe0Vv6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14801,"logo_path":"/bnlD5KJ5oSzBYbEpDkwi6w8SoBO.png","name":"Apple","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apple Music Awards 2019: Billie Eilish Live at the Steve Jobs Theater","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2413513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billie Eilish","original_name":"Billie Eilish","popularity":2.7608,"profile_path":"/1KCVr3JPHt4IHwqEuf0v8GwwRZl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66983881918061a8e175f386","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1396403,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"FINNEAS","original_name":"FINNEAS","popularity":1.1231,"profile_path":"/v23y9ynke6fkWA7oxDIPEtJOWQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66983892e43be83573278b1e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1556959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Wrench","original_name":"Sam Wrench","popularity":0.2135,"profile_path":"/odEmgv7BYazCIMgwuMHRZ3ZIwpy.jpg","credit_id":"669838b6f11b4f1ac1231141","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4835283,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Regalado","original_name":"Andrea Regalado","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669839a7af3b8e43a5804a98","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4835280,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Corwyn Duckworth","original_name":"Corwyn Duckworth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669838f9780e5d4c9f2986c4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4835281,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elizabeth Kelly","original_name":"Elizabeth Kelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6698395f1a209cf6be23115e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3364482,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian French","original_name":"Brian French","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66983925e8c853ba00e81f04","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4495065,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Easton","original_name":"Emma Easton","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66983912130510d80824d820","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2648642,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aron Levine","original_name":"Aron Levine","popularity":0.0268,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66983978d2c756f8ec7ff245","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11945282","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5ogc86eKk4FULqd6xDxxEAe0Vv6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Billie Eilish - everything i wanted (LIVE FROM THE STEVE JOBS THEATER)","key":"WwR-jyPHZ4Q","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-12-04T17:00:13.000Z","id":"66983a8e7620265bc624d81f"}]}}}
