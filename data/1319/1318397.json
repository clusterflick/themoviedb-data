He has lived his life by the book. He has been a faithful husband, a strong father, and a hard worker. Now facing down the barrel of middle-age, and growing more detached in his marriage, he has begun to wrestle with emotions he never imagined having to deal with. James has started to realize that he is attracted to members of the same sex. After one fateful night, in which James decides to hook up with another man he meets at a gay club, he goes to confession for guidance on how to reconcile these feelings with the life he has already made for himself.","popularity":0.0853,"poster_path":"/uKqtpFx6pffcttGPNBTRieyGHsR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Confessional","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3828756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Effie Cacarnakis","original_name":"Effie Cacarnakis","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6699243e39b65389c1d239cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4836564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Crocker","original_name":"Drew Crocker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66992452d0dde7c0e55a95e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4836565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Bonnell","original_name":"William Bonnell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6699245b94e33af7e518672d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4343751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin D.
