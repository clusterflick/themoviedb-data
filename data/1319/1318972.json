Filmed on 16th. October 1982 in Newburg, Maryland and featuring 13 songs in the sixty minute playing time and in very good quality. Includes: Anybody Out There; Texas Tea; What's Forever For; Honky Tonk Heaven; Look Me Up; Gone At Last; Solitaire; Love Is In The Air. A rarity in that not much early footage exists of Orion from the Sun period and even better since the songs are mostly Jimmy's own with little Elvis orientated tracks.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/olq7fXSF0BNBxbOUsjzMj6KWS6J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ORION Live: At the North 40 Club","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4839238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Orion Ellis","original_name":"Jimmy Orion Ellis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"669b177a613a18499c7769d0","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/olq7fXSF0BNBxbOUsjzMj6KWS6J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1982-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
