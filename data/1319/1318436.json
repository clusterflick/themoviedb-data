They arrange for the release of Rob Thrasher (AKA Rob the Slasher) and place him into SMith Woods, telling him to destroy anyone who defiles the wooded area.  Rob has his own ideas who should be destroyed. He adds cheerleaders to that list. Along with cheerleaders, ANYONE associated with them. Friends, lovers, family, pets, etc...  Unfortunately for Rob, an ancient evil lurks within the soil of these woods. A demonic force that will  use his rage  to unleash them from their imprisonment, to spread death and chaos to mankind.  First there were litterbugs and cheerleaders, now there are demons...
