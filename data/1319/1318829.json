The plot is set in an imaginary Slovenian industrial town, where three best friends reside. A chance encounter with a young woman named Fantasy, who is going through a gender transition, will change their lives for the better. The secondary topic of the movie is the milieu of immigrants, characterised by the paradox between apparent assimilation, and the pressures of tradition and the drive for uniformity.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Fantasy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2471719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kukla","original_name":"Kukla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669a9a00a28939f73a8a4e3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1889467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lazar Bogdanović","original_name":"Lazar Bogdanović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669a9a1ac11ceff736584073","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2471719,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kukla","original_name":"Kukla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669a9a0ee17c390cc28309d9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2049927,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lukas Miheljak","original_name":"Lukas Miheljak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669a9a2f9865c2c263dfc3c9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
