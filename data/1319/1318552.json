He and the open-hearted woman grow closer, but then the patriarch's health causes their planned wedding to be brought forward. Carefully constructed character drama that is less about culture clash or a love story than about an elegy to ideals of masculinity and the principles of western capitalism. The melancholic character of the film is underlined by cool images.","popularity":0.2218,"poster_path":"/rHH3Xs8E5EK5qQIOLUglKejPnQm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tage mit Naadirah","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1705514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Humnig","original_name":"Christoph Humnig","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/75woF9QjUIcco4DOZDWSEtG0OKN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66998c0b33db55d2e54b812b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4403427,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenda Hmeidan","original_name":"Kenda Hmeidan","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/mPqG6asu3e3N0JAGbFuUFfPWVq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"66998c1359f25d778ef7fedd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2192150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katharina Bach","original_name":"Katharina Bach","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66998c1d295d66d1816f2805","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Kuchenbuch","original_name":"Christian Kuchenbuch","popularity":0.152,"profile_path":"/3dmJrlWLLIKjtu95NoRkknJbytN.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66998c272f53c1b2c54b814a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4837154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mehmet Yilmaz","original_name":"Mehmet Yilmaz","popularity":0.0979,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66998c34dbb3641f116f27f0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2435978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josephine Frydetzki","original_name":"Josephine Frydetzki","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66998bfb5b41020596fd7294","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4872264,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gisela Wehrl","original_name":"Gisela Wehrl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b387f49d8fb01d4da87b12","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2435978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josephine Frydetzki","original_name":"Josephine Frydetzki","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b387f890908f2c6f542835","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1638601,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Hartmann","original_name":"David Hartmann","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/3LXVBTCOZT1MvT5345A6i72299L.jpg","credit_id":"66b387ff94064f429a92df98","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1326661,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Undine Filter","original_name":"Undine Filter","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b38807c0a31b530562263c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31668,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Britta Knöller","original_name":"Britta Knöller","popularity":0.0671,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b3888e0d3ffa55c86f7597","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":64392,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Thomas Král","original_name":"Thomas Král","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b3889790908f2c6f542839","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans-Christian Schmid","original_name":"Hans-Christian Schmid","popularity":0.1458,"profile_path":"/pXNkFg5kDi2f1b5mueNf9bf3rWH.jpg","credit_id":"66b3889fb62be2e3f0542849","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt33079466","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1699,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/rHH3Xs8E5EK5qQIOLUglKejPnQm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
