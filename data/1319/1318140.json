Trump, and all those who support him. This explosive film uncovers the depths of deceit and manipulation they employ daily, betraying the very system they vowed to protect. \"Government Gangsters\" is not just a film-it's a revelation that will forever alter your perception of government. May we never need another film like this.","popularity":0.2738,"poster_path":"/4ZeLxgOMjG8mDMjkH80UaAwl2Xb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":234153,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warroom Films","origin_country":""},{"id":69034,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lightspeed Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy","title":"Government Gangsters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3218880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kash Patel","original_name":"Kash Patel","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6698363def185de0cd71feba","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4835267,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joshua Wade","original_name":"Joshua Wade","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6698371183a7797a2dbfb1fb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4835255,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stephen K.
