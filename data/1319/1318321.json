These videos are created from footage found on discarded home videotapes. On these tapes are fragments of the lives of people I’ve never met and most likely will never encounter. I’m fascinated by the fact that these memories have been lost or sold or traded, and the people that recorded these events have probably forgotten these tapes even exist. The attempt to understand or explain the people on these tapes is futile; they exist only as they filmed each other in a specific time and place. The weddings, graduations, birthdays, and everyday lives captured on these tapes have a fractured, dream-like logic. It is this meandering and seemingly aimless material that I begin with.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thrift Store Video #3","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4836207,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brent Watanabe","original_name":"Brent Watanabe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6698e0333d30f6774e5bd5a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
