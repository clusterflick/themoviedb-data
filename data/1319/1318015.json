A daydreamer who has lived with hearing loss for his whole life. As his condition deteriorates, Mark must listen to his past and face the present, in order to move forward with his life. Sometimes loss doesn't mean lost. At a routine checkup with his lifelong audiologist, Mark is presented with a hearing aid and with a choice. Between the torment from his childhood - and his stigma around wearing the hearing aid - he lashes out. But he remembers his young self, loving and loved; along with the care his late mother showed him. Through courage, he is able to connect with her; as she guides him through this tumultuous time in his life. He realises he can either continue to shut himself off from the world, or open up and begin to accept himself for who he really is.","popularity":0.4397,"poster_path":"/iAEW0CXd1sIZ7rs6luLvedhivQT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":233826,"logo_path":null,"name":"SwanDive
