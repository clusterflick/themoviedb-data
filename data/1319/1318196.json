In this new film, he poses the question, “why is it easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism?”  Perhaps the answer is ‘Accelerationism’, which emerged 50 years ago and predicted the reality we’re now living: A frenzied stasis of rapid technological advancement coupled with cultural and political stagnation. Capitalism – Accelerationism claims – is breaking down our society, our humanity, and our planet. But the only way forward is not to run from it, but to dive deeper into it. Regardless of where that takes us…  As befitting for an artist as visual and extreme as Jake Chapman, this film is also part-artwork – playfully and uncompromisingly distorting the idea of how a documentary should look and feel.","popularity":0.1799,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21526,"logo_path":null,"name":"Supercollider
