In-depth conversations with legendary Coloradans, including GOCO co-founders Roy Romer and Ken Salazar, tell the origin story, and how the mission is possible thanks to passionate partners across the state, the people of Colorado, and GOCO's funding source, the Colorado Lottery.  A combination of intimate interviews, archival footage, present-day scenes, and 8-mm film pays homage to Colorado’s outdoor heritage and GOCO’s continued commitment to conservation and recreation.","popularity":0.839,"poster_path":"/cZG3H19x185ddl4rdDtijJZcFcU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Futuristic Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Legends of Great Outdoors Colorado","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4834701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Salazar","original_name":"Ken Salazar","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Ken Salazar","credit_id":"6697da1679fba8399c8e4c95","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4834702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Romer","original_name":"Roy Romer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Roy Romer","credit_id":"6697da2701773f1135681a05","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4834704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca Frank","original_name":"Rebecca Frank","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Rebecca Frank","credit_id":"6697da3479fba8399c8e4ca5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4834706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sydney Macy","original_name":"Sydney Macy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sydney Macy","credit_id":"6697da42fb9117f803aaecc5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4834708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Wright","original_name":"Ruth Wright","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ruth Wright","credit_id":"6697da5bd0b925c02c7c9147","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4834711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brendan Young","original_name":"Brendan Young","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6697da99819e3e78f6c96821","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4834715,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christian Silberbauer","original_name":"Christian Silberbauer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6697daf237e4c73a048a07ae","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4834716,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dylan Stephens","original_name":"Dylan Stephens","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6697db26943a13b456a9ff1f","department":"Production","job":"Development Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4834717,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"William Gardner","original_name":"William Gardner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6697db65d7f1a224c012db06","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4834719,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Tese Davis","original_name":"Tese Davis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6697db8c1007bb4e4a8a085b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4834724,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Samantha Sigler","original_name":"Samantha Sigler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6697dbee2a1faa89297f0d21","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1035,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g0gHSfPDwGwqPQL2Jitmr43ZBrQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1840}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":3.685,"height":289,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qNy7tz1P0D7eiKKZiqN44MJ6gky.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1065}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2304,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cZG3H19x185ddl4rdDtijJZcFcU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1981,"name":"colorado"},{"id":3730,"name":"recreation"},{"id":211143,"name":"conservation"},{"id":256402,"name":"outdoors"},{"id":272851,"name":"environmental documentary"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer: Legends of Great Outdoors Colorado","key":"jWEI1Kiy0ew","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-07-04T15:56:14.000Z","id":"6697d84ad7f1a224c012dadc"}]}}}
