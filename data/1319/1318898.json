Its the story of the relationships of six New Jersey surfers who got on a surfboard 50 years ago and haven't stopped to this day. Pioneering the surf break at the Casino Pier in Seaside Heights, NJ in the 60's, surfing freezing waters before wetsuits existed, they found themselves inside the grip of a passion, an obsession so deep, only those who ride waves would understand. Surfing the Pier was a privilege earned, a territory protected, and friendships were complicated by fierce competition. The Pier, an icon for decades was destroyed by Hurricane Sandy. This is the life story of these men, deeply connected to nature, water and weather, and the lessons learned from the ocean.","popularity":0.2406,"poster_path":"/mdylfZLSpl0ykzD1Ev7755Zo7gO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A
