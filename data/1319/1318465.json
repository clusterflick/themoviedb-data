They are about a hand-knotted carpet, the strange German language, a wall separating the city and the people, daughters on both sides of the wall, various secret services, the Shah of Persia, an Armenian assassin, noisy students, Schultheiss beer, Schrippen, and pomegranates. Are these stories true? Well, at least they fire the author's imagination. She gathers old and new material and mixes and animates it into a cheerful collage full of serious events. It is her look at Vigen and his time in the 60s, early 70s in Berlin. How did world politics affect his life, and what happened to his dreams?","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/4uRKC2rjR8R5pbKQCP4VI1QosGr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vigen, Berlin and the Cold War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4836827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aviva Barkhourdarian","original_name":"Aviva Barkhourdarian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669958d737a28438b1f7fd7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4832948,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lorenz Fischer","original_name":"Lorenz Fischer","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/l2tkWloz4xY08AajLeeOTNjHa10.jpg","credit_id":"67056b56222ead1edac01eb3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":945,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4uRKC2rjR8R5pbKQCP4VI1QosGr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
