It is a premonition of global world changes... and a hope for the prudence of humanity.  Human beings live in a world of memories, fears and passions, dreams and hopes. In our memories, we increasingly want to return to the world of childhood - summer, where joy and light reign, as opposed to cruel reality, loneliness and existentialism. But it is becoming more and more difficult to get into this world, to dissolve at least mentally in the sun's glare.  This film is about man in nature and nature in man, about cyclicality, the beginning and the end - the path to eternity. Autumn is heading towards winter, and we are so eager for light.","popularity":0.203,"poster_path":"/cCeDjDvWtOX7OE17YqKwaEK4trG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Noise of the Downpour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4838609,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Stupak","original_name":"Oleksandr Stupak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669aa63b40fb168af1faa887","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1332,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cCeDjDvWtOX7OE17YqKwaEK4trG.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":888}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"uk","note":"10th International Festival Signes de Nuit - Bangkok","release_date":"2024-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
