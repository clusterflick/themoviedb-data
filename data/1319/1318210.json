The play presents love in all its glory, warts and all: Love at first sight, innocent love, love twisted by the mind, by lust, by jealousy, by a marriage on the rocks; love that is thrown into chaos by a mischievous fairy’s mistake. Expect gossamer and moonshine—lions and lanterns—original music and magic in the realm of shadows and dreams in this re-telling of Shakespeare's comic revel.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind.","title":"\"Midsummer Night's Dream\" by the University of Iowa Department of Theatre Arts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
