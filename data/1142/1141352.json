Packed with absurd characters, unforeseen plot twists and a delightfully farcical finale, Pinafore is a satirical take on the British class system and the promotion of unqualified people to positions of power.  When Josephine, the daughter of Captain Corcoran, falls for the lowly sailor Ralph Rackstraw, she’s torn between her heart’s true love, and her desire to honour her father’s wish for her to marry Sir Joseph Porter, the First Lord of the Admiralty.","popularity":0.1668,"poster_path":"/5gbGYVzvXuLYKhto2fJ5Y2g4TL7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65595,"logo_path":null,"name":"ENO: English National Opera","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HMS Pinafore - English National Opera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":202120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Les Dennis","original_name":"Les Dennis","popularity":0.2322,"profile_path":"/kolvrhjXym23ppejdyNo1N0qN5r.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sir Joseph Porter","credit_id":"648cff8fc3c891010ca441c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4116350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Savournin","original_name":"John Savournin","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Captain Corcoran","credit_id":"648cffd2559d2200ff102e5f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4088789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandra Oomens","original_name":"Alexandra Oomens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Josephine","credit_id":"648d0018c2ff3d0139ad75da","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2277269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Waddington","original_name":"Henry Waddington","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dick Deadeye","credit_id":"648d003e42bf01013bbc46f7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2168970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hilary Summers","original_name":"Hilary Summers","popularity":0.0364,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Cripps (Little Buttercup)","credit_id":"648d00a0c3c891012d5d069a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2748333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus Farnsworth","original_name":"Marcus Farnsworth","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Boatswain","credit_id":"648d056842bf0100e49ddbe3","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1383797,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"W.S.
