Wanting to preserve Albers’s teaching method—learning by doing—Bittleman set out with filmmaker and editor Carl Howard to make a visual record of Albers teaching students how to see and use color as a visual grammar. The film includes archival footage of Josef Albers at home in conversation with Bittleman, as well as footage from Black Mountain College and Yale University.","popularity":0.1958,"poster_path":"/9dSDnWpsPfgP2UOTnEsSByXay5M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114996,"logo_path":null,"name":"Educational Communications Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":202429,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bittleman Works","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Josef Albers demonstrates the interaction of color","title":"To Open Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4118007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Albers","original_name":"Josef Albers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"648e743bc2ff3d00e2e066f7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4118005,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arnold Bittleman","original_name":"Arnold Bittleman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648e7412559d2200e20661af","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4118009,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carl Howard","original_name":"Carl Howard","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648e747626346200ae1bf1c0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9dSDnWpsPfgP2UOTnEsSByXay5M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9268,"name":"yale university"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":184184,"name":"bauhaus"},{"id":318924,"name":"josef albers"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
