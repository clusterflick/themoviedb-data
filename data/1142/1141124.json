In the simple, clean style of the era's cartoon shows, Mr. Clean and the Raid bug spray pests make their now familiar appearance, demonstrating that some advertising campaigns have an enduring appeal. Humor is another common aspect of this selection of commercials. The comedic opera singers making an epic out of a scouring pad commercial are particularly memorable! This sampling of the most popular advertising from television's early days is a fascinating and lighthearted retrospective of what was then a new commercial art form.  Although dated and out of style by today's sophisticated standards, these ads possess an enduring, quaint appeal.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/xe6Q0js95bEaZwHtRkXWwQc5Ryg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nostalgia television: the early years.","title":"Classic Commercials: Volume 1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xe6Q0js95bEaZwHtRkXWwQc5Ryg.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8wkdwKSxdzyWlkonIIRUevwtaYQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"VHS","release_date":"1998-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
