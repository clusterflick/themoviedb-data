Working in secret, the Progressive Group organized the 1959 Theatre Boycott to end segregation in movie theatres in Hamilton. Context is provided by those who protested against segregation and the limited franchise earlier in Bermuda by authoring a \"Secret Document\" that analyzed the social problems of the island. The film also features a rare interview conducted in London, England with Kingsley Tweed-a powerful, public figure during the boycott that changed the island forever. -- Chris Campbell","popularity":0.0416,"poster_path":"/miHtQqqJyc2E48JuVFYRSvUEYkX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":197176,"logo_path":null,"name":"NB Filmmakers Co-op","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BM","name":"Bermuda"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2002-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Voices Rise...","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4116101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kingsley Tweed","original_name":"Kingsley Tweed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hyakBlPhcGVD2X42jNerCl97HeF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"648ccdf5559d2200ff101935","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4115790,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Errol Williams","original_name":"Errol Williams","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/uyOtUQaAiXMjWWOeOcpUa7RPypW.jpg","credit_id":"648cce0a076ce800ad72d01c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2407827,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris Campbell","original_name":"Chris Campbell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648cce4942bf01013bbc312e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0320760","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/miHtQqqJyc2E48JuVFYRSvUEYkX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2002-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
