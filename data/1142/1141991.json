Secretly and passionately in love with beautiful Roxane, Cyrano, who is embarrassed by his elongated nose, is shocked to find out that she has fallen head-over-heels in love with the handsome but superficial recruit to the Cadets de Gascogne, Christian de Neuvillette. As a result, convinced that he stands no chance against the handsome but tongue-tied suitor, Cyrano steps aside and becomes Christian's tutor in the delicate matters of love, composing poems and ardent letters to help him woo Roxane.","popularity":0.2386,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United
