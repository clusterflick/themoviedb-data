The collage aesthetic exposes how human relationships—between men and women, men and men, women and women—are mediated by dominant ideologies as represented in the mass media and religion. Bobe posits no theories and draws no conclusions, leaving the viewer with a truly postmodern conundrum about life, love, art, men, women and death.","popularity":0.0726,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hombres muertos de amor y la jauría de mujeres","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4115775,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germán Bobe","original_name":"Germán Bobe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648ca773c3c891014ebce4a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-06-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
