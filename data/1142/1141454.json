Male-on-female violence is an all-too-common occurrence in Iran. It’s part of a wider exploration of gender imbalance that permeates so much of Banietemad’s work. Here, the filmmaker journeys into the backstreets of one of the poorer districts of Tehran, to a shelter where women can find safety, community and a sense of belonging with others who understand their situation – whose lives have been marked by suffering and humiliation.","popularity":0.0416,"poster_path":"/9dtTj0kwVBHOirls8ML5I59dRsQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2009-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angels of the House of Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lili Arshad","original_name":"Lili Arshad","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64a147188c0a480101770522","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soroor Monshizadeh","original_name":"Soroor Monshizadeh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"64a1472dc390c500ca003b59","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1061523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rakhshan Banietemad","original_name":"Rakhshan Banietemad","popularity":0.1032,"profile_path":"/xE0Nxrhh8stWNDE0Ma3vH69SgGQ.jpg","credit_id":"64a1466e0cb33500ab97b996","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1831950,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sepideh Abdolvahab","original_name":"Sepideh Abdolvahab","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a146d90cb33500fe5f352c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4141911,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zahra Jan Nesari","original_name":"Zahra Jan Nesari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a146ea4a52f80126951196","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2607810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gelareh Kiazand","original_name":"Gelareh Kiazand","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a146c54a52f8012695116f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1061523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rakhshan Banietemad","original_name":"Rakhshan Banietemad","popularity":0.1032,"profile_path":"/xE0Nxrhh8stWNDE0Ma3vH69SgGQ.jpg","credit_id":"64a146a1c390c500aeb14f1b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":39399,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Amir-Hossein Ghasemi","original_name":"Amir-Hossein Ghasemi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64a14700c390c500aeb14f47","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1982,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9dtTj0kwVBHOirls8ML5I59dRsQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
