Each scene is represented by different poems that manifests symbolic images and sounds.  \"This is a film about the process of grief and facing the loss of my father. It tells the story of where it has left me as well as the last moments I had with him. Not only is this my own method of processing these complex emotions but it is also my way of sharing this experience with others who have and will go through the same experience. It was crucial for this project to be shot on film because the format holds a symbolic significance. Just like film, grief needs time to be processed and to be taken care of gently.\" â€” K.S.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5HRTEC97SwncWXW73DKGirepkgc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After Coma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4114945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"SooHyun Kim","original_name":"SooHyun Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648c2982559d2200e20546df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5HRTEC97SwncWXW73DKGirepkgc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
