In a gesture of allyship with SWAPO, the GDR accepted almost 500 children for their “protection, education, and socialist training.” In 1990, they were suddenly returned—after Namibia's independence and first all-race elections, which took place the same week as the Berlin Wall opened.  The young people interviewed in this film reflect on the experiences of the Namibian children who spent their childhoods in East Germany, focusing especially on their sense of identity and the difficulties they faced fitting into society.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":94849,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avanti Film","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NA","name":"Namibia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Namibia - Return to a New Country","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Namibia - Return to a New Country","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Schuch","original_name":"Christoph Schuch","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648df90142bf010101be580e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Schuch","original_name":"Christoph Schuch","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d44099b9d5ef5047ae286f","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3998960,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Janne Busse","original_name":"Janne Busse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d4410819a3aa3458b18ecf","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4916700,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Thomas Schuch","original_name":"Thomas Schuch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d440ee845738f656947970","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4916700,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Thomas Schuch","original_name":"Thomas Schuch","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d440c5a6965075d0cb5462","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234839,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Schuch","original_name":"Christoph Schuch","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d440da482128e9b56a8f73","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
