What is shown is my reality between ambiguity and ambivalence. This moment is strong and clear in factual emotionality. This moment is also a permanent state and beyond my possibilities of verbal communication. This video with the music piece \"Funny Feelings\" by Tina Jander shows a simultaneity of opposites. Poetry of Aimlessness shows facts.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/aQl6H9rGIA9fgudUVkXtbiqOVEH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poetry of Aimlessness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1545092,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Karø Goldt","original_name":"Karø Goldt","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/jMfKfHRHOZLsrmkdWblQxSUpW4p.jpg","credit_id":"648d9fda2f8d090100a9ee98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":952,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aQl6H9rGIA9fgudUVkXtbiqOVEH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":644}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://ausland-berlin.de/karo-goldt-better-others","release_date":"2022-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
