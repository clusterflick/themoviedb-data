He wrote to JLG and asked him if he could \"look over his shoulder\" while he is at work. JLG never answered.  Rejected by the master, the teenager must now find his own way as a filmmaker until that day in 2021 when he senses JLG's end is near. Thomas decides to visit the master. On foot. A pilgrimage to pay his (last) respects.His aim is to meet JLG in person. Thomas Imbach dreams of filming not the master, but WITH the master, for which reason d, he has packed his Aaton camera in his backpack. The closer he gets to Lake Geneva, the more intense his emotions, his anxiety, his uncertainty.  SAY GOD BYE is the story of an obsession; it is also a story about the universal theme of love. It is the story of a man who finally summons the courage to seek out his beloved, to tell him face to face about his lifelong love and to say, “Thank you, JLG”.","popularity":0.1371,"poster_path":"/FQVKmjv2G4lKgL9RyCr7oidMRV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Okofilm
