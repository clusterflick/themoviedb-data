Fehintola became hooked on heroin while working on a book about a group of drug addicts. Regan caught up with him again in the 2001 film Cold Turkey, as Fehintola attempted to break his addiction by locking himself in his flat without medication. My Friend Lanre jumps two decades, to a moment when Fehintola has been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Regan never set out to document someone dying, but this is what his film becomes. Drawing from over 25 years of footage, the filmmaker presents an intensely intimate portrayal of his friendship and collaboration with Fehintola. It is charming, funny, devastating and, by its close, a bravely personal, living testament to one person’s life and work.","popularity":0.1653,"poster_path":"/6GKDI0h7PK5kr75FfWFpekyhv3H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74063,"logo_path":"/xnsCQCEwUhofmWgBMzzPqhxJOhT.png","name":"EMU Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"independent documentary","title":"My Friend Lanre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1602301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lanre Fehintola","original_name":"Lanre Fehintola","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"662133ede4c9eb00e6f4f571","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Regan","original_name":"Leo Regan","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6717f36e5be9e8759da69526","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Regan","original_name":"Leo Regan","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"655b02ce53866e00abadea1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4602972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Carson","original_name":"Mary Carson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f9d617706b9f017dd3b8a0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2257073,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chloe Lambourne","original_name":"Chloe Lambourne","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f9d6437390c0017d30359a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3172455,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sakky Barnor","original_name":"Sakky Barnor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65f9d65c5ff34e017cb5cf63","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Regan","original_name":"Leo Regan","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6623e9dbb9a0bd0161d46b88","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leo Regan","original_name":"Leo Regan","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6623e9e9e894a601643a0974","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28651017","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"@myfriendlanre","twitter_id":"@myfriendlanre"},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vqUdXvHpvVxKMeqxs0wIC4rttqp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6GKDI0h7PK5kr75FfWFpekyhv3H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MY FRIEND LANRE TRAILER","key":"836503455","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-06-15T11:21:51.000Z","id":"6623ea6707faa201639863df"}]}}}
