Pakay worked closely with the staff of The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation and its Executive Director, Nicholas Fox Weber, who was a close friend of both the Alberses, and conducted a number of unprecedented interviews with people significant in both of the Alberses' lives. The film includes rare footage of the art of both Josef and Anni and insightful commentary from personal friends of the artists, including architect Philip Johnson, who arranged for them to come to the U.S. as refugees from Nazi Germany in 1933.","popularity":0.0553,"poster_path":"/3g7JyuMEyJVV8XD1oDrHcCXzp6u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192582,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hudson Film Works","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Josef and Anni Albers: Art Is Everywhere","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4118007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Albers","original_name":"Josef Albers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"648e7f5026346200ca1a5056","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2119382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sedat Pakay","original_name":"Sedat Pakay","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648e7f72c3c89100eb32d80a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1422,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3g7JyuMEyJVV8XD1oDrHcCXzp6u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Josef and Anni â€“ Art is Everywhere (Sedat Pakay, 2006)","key":"DUaJpYj0440","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-08-21T20:22:03.000Z","id":"648e7fc1c3c891014ebde26f"}]}}}
