In this collection, several products are advertised on the basis of demonstrations: a tough RCA radio is shown surviving a nasty fall; a Bulova watch sails over Niagara falls without ill effects; a line of Chevrolet trucks show their mettle as they are taken on a grueling Arctic trip. Humor is also used to great effect, as always. Spot the famous Hai Karate aftershave ad in which a man suddenly attracts more attention than he expects, and a Hamms beer ad showing people who just can't keep a grip on the competitor's drink. Color is seen in an increasing number of commercials as technology evolves.","popularity":0.0393,"poster_path":"/ibLOd48jHabX3oFKbwXKfbiwNMu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nostalgia television: the early years.","title":"Classic Commercials: Volume 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ibLOd48jHabX3oFKbwXKfbiwNMu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"VHS","release_date":"1998-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
