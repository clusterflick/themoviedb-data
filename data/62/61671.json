In several, teen boys come out, perhaps first to a close friend - how will the friends react? For some youths, coming out risks violence. In two films, love is thwarted - by mother, in one, and by immigration, in another.  The collection includes \"Summer\" (Great Britain), \"Night Swimming\" (USA), \"Running Without Sound\" (USA), \"Out Now\" (Germany), \"Œdipe N+1\" (France), \"Hitchcocked\" (USA), and \"The Bridge\" (Australia).","popularity":0.4365,"poster_path":"/ejb3iJLA7mWsBP3jjR2JeFAVO1B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92902,"logo_path":"/6SJVURgcLSkkqTzV16zs0LAwpsg.png","name":"Wolfe Video","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boy Crush","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":115004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuval David","original_name":"Yuval David","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Al (segment \"Hitchcocked\")","credit_id":"58d9afff9251411fd5078587","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":85756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frankie Shaw","original_name":"Frankie Shaw","popularity":0.7254,"profile_path":"/yY8wTV6PCnkuW333D15yqsdBfYg.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Amber (segment \"Night Swimming\")","credit_id":"58d9b017c3a368126706c316","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1668443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Barbakadze","original_name":"George Barbakadze","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b8a4f2c3a3682f910004f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1668444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Falcone","original_name":"Daniel Falcone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b8a4fac3a368295b0005a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hong Khaou","original_name":"Hong Khaou","popularity":0.1036,"profile_path":"/7npbshcBbJw6JcwoYgvuGiBYnLN.jpg","credit_id":"57b8a50392514118b1000654","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438877,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kingsley Judd","original_name":"Kingsley Judd","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b8a50cc3a3682ed700058a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1151215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sven J.
