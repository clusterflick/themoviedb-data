Unprepared for the task, but unwilling to see them suffer, he takes them into his care and keeping...with the help of an offbeat angel. It is a daunting task with unintended...sometimes hilarious consequences. As the wolf cubs grow, so does Jim's love for them. But wolves are creatures of the wild, and Jim is faced with the excruciating decision to return his companions from whence they came. When a greedy real estate developer (David Nibley) plans threaten the wolves survival, Jim must protect them in their natural habitat...and in the courtroom. Friends For Life is a heartwarming 3D adventure appropriate for all ages","popularity":0.6074,"poster_path":"/y5v590vzJl9NUL5RNRwJe2fsDqo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22087,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grizzly Film Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":22088,"logo_path":null,"name":"Graça Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2008-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Friends for Life","video":false,"vote_average":6.333,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Amigos para Sempre","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Farkaskölykök","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Niezwykli przyjaciele","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7144,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Flynn","original_name":"Michael Flynn","popularity":0.4101,"profile_path":"/wKrYz7dO9dEbJBIVHTiNdzib8FD.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Jim","credit_id":"55a6d8bfc3a3683005000528","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":296280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Chunga","original_name":"Jimmy Chunga","popularity":0.0938,"profile_path":"/BI48BKbaWBc1v7j3sJOtzkemja.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Raphael / Ralph","credit_id":"54c7d658c3a36874b70048c8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":229423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tayva Patch","original_name":"Tayva Patch","popularity":0.0849,"profile_path":"/yjbNyWVWYxmoVf5AjH4dWzp2eNz.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Maggie","credit_id":"54c7d67a9251416794004558","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Halford","original_name":"Charles Halford","popularity":0.7025,"profile_path":"/mrCy6dA5AHqczA4aJX4drCQ3tjC.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Rutgers","credit_id":"5827aa219251417b2101f62a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Nibley","original_name":"David Nibley","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":"/wzic0n5TdR395OUQfTDrZv3nRKH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Beddows","credit_id":"54c7d688c3a36870ba000446","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Connie Young","original_name":"Connie Young","popularity":0.1104,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":22,"character":"Claire","credit_id":"6255e7e739b6c3005180f9ad","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1419294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Ackerman","original_name":"Bruce Ackerman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/3CWhC7oXLDn3V8t493HoNojn0eu.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Beddows's Contractor","credit_id":"54c7d6d292514157cc000457","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1419295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maikel Bailey","original_name":"Maikel Bailey","popularity":0.1036,"profile_path":"/ybjhl358fyIRK2lrNc81aNDMIuo.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sheriff","credit_id":"54c7d700c3a3683f7d003d84","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Shoemaker","original_name":"Tim Shoemaker","popularity":0.1026,"profile_path":"/lCb3ALzsFsVaN3EJVi6ZdQgVCqD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Alan","credit_id":"54c7d698c3a3683f7d003d75","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1265246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Moffat","original_name":"Emily Moffat","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/bu6o6CZtAcMzr8tHR4GJgsTFHsc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Beddows's Lawyer","credit_id":"54c7d6a9c3a368700600043d","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1419296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert J.
