Along for the trip is Jack's adopted son, Billy. Their search brings them to an island off the coast of Argentina... and into the clutches of a primitive cannibal tribe, the Yamma Yamma. Alexis Kinkaid, a mysterious recluse who has made his home on the island amongst the cannibals, may hold the key to unlocking the island's secret... if they don't end up in the belly of a savage first! Isle of the Damned, originally released in Italy in 1980, brought Giallo under fire yet again by the Italian government, who were outraged by the shocking and real scenes of primitive tribal rituals and cannibalism portrayed in the film. The film has been long out of print, but is presented here in a digitally remastered form.","popularity":0.0806,"poster_path":"/22JjOdUBcvjxs0RfnTt3CYy3wYc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47338,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dire Wit Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Savage cruelty was their culture... human flesh was their food!","title":"Isle of the Damned","video":false,"vote_average":4.1,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bind Them and Kill Them!","type":"International Working Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Cannibal Island Holocaust","type":"International Bootleg Title"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Cannibal Inferno - Menschenfleisch ist ihre Nahrung","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Cannibal Inferno - Lauf, wenn du leben willst","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Gamber","original_name":"Larry Gamber","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1000,"character":"Jack Steele","credit_id":"52fe464bc3a368484e088d37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232706,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Crates","original_name":"Peter Crates","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1001,"character":"Billy","credit_id":"52fe464bc3a368484e088d3b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrician Rosa","original_name":"Patrician Rosa","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1002,"character":"Harold Thompson","credit_id":"52fe464bc3a368484e088d3f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Langsdorf","original_name":"Keith Langsdorf","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1003,"character":"Alexis Kincaid","credit_id":"52fe464bc3a368484e088d43","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jared Books","original_name":"Jared Books","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1006,"character":"Scurvy Dan","credit_id":"53959622c3a36864230043e2","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Colegrove","original_name":"Mark Colegrove","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe464bc3a368484e088d49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":232710,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Leake","original_name":"Mark Leake","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe464bc3a368484e088d4f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1440398,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Joyce","original_name":"Paul Joyce","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642994aa01b1ca00777b02b6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1260052","wikidata_id":"Q1674256","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vsbzIDvWKNjZqr3tZhpc3w3lr9t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1419,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/22JjOdUBcvjxs0RfnTt3CYy3wYc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":946},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rsi6BmBeRZZPZ8hysDDtuldUHke.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lIADe5fn83LkoO6tLU9WmL1J7fd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Isle of the Damned Trailer","key":"2yW4xIyOu0k","published_at":"2009-10-04T15:27:47.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6b7c3a36854480063c7"}]}}}
