He is found with a arrow through the heart, but Vance deduces that the body was placed and not found where he was killed. The note found dealing with the murder was part of a nursery rhyme and signed by 'Bishop'. The only witness may have been Mrs. Drukker and Adolph, but they are not talking. As the murders progress, each one is accompanied by a nursery rhyme. It is up to Philo Vance to unravel the clues and unmask the identity of the murderer 'Bishop'.","popularity":0.5066,"poster_path":"/srYgjTKvoXvOIAbRUjNmfWP1hcl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"ALL-TALKING!...ALL-THRILLS!","title":"The Bishop Murder Case","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Basil Rathbone","original_name":"Basil Rathbone","popularity":0.7956,"profile_path":"/otVwo6h7l0QJK94qadNRsjW5HNo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Philo Vance","credit_id":"52fe4657c3a368484e08b5c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leila Hyams","original_name":"Leila Hyams","popularity":0.1868,"profile_path":"/opmYXK7fBjtP7NWqMMffGQzjw1U.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Belle Dillard","credit_id":"52fe4657c3a368484e08b5c9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roland Young","original_name":"Roland Young","popularity":0.2571,"profile_path":"/hme2CvDcGqdZEsPKcdvhjgEvvDl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sigurd 'Erik' Arnesson","credit_id":"52fe4657c3a368484e08b5cd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alec B.
