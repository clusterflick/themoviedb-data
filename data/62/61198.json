But whose advice should he take? Does 94-year-old exercise guru Jack LaLanne have all the answers, or does Buster, a 101-year-old chain-smoking, beer-drinking marathoner? What about futurist Ray Kurzweil, a laughter yoga expert, or an elder porn star? Wexler explores the viewpoints of delightfully unusual characters alongside those of health, fitness and life-extension experts in this engaging new documentary, which challenges our notions of youth and aging with comic poignancy. Begun as a study in life-extension, How To Live Forever evolves into a thought-provoking examination of what truly gives life meaning.","popularity":1.0283,"poster_path":"/yiCe8kJqqhaJGhGgIis6ITt8NED.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-13","revenue":40836,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Live Forever","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Kurzweil","original_name":"Ray Kurzweil","popularity":0.1721,"profile_path":"/1vUFcUOTTKaFCB0O2WkiB77isaG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4649c3a368484e088729","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aubrey de Grey","original_name":"Aubrey de Grey","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":"/3YseHjLgtDiKz629lYKeuGcotKn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4649c3a368484e08872d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62923,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ray Bradbury","original_name":"Ray Bradbury","popularity":0.6076,"profile_path":"/3O3YSFLhhtm5Jt4zSL5hovCDPKR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4649c3a368484e088731","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":161912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzanne Somers","original_name":"Suzanne Somers","popularity":0.7346,"profile_path":"/5DkcsnRuNHaAOJ3bowqGE1HMiD4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4649c3a368484e088735","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phyllis Diller","original_name":"Phyllis Diller","popularity":0.6016,"profile_path":"/teELYDRWmPGAVCzH4n4lX17Wa4J.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4649c3a368484e088739","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":550298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianne Williamson","original_name":"Marianne Williamson","popularity":0.3614,"profile_path":"/l3OUlM7zBery2SN2UVmRyugSKb0.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4649c3a368484e08873d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3196701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Lynch","original_name":"Thomas Lynch","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61168284cee48100721f31dd","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack LaLanne","original_name":"Jack LaLanne","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/7AQCSDZKfETPPryMFYCRJ1oy6Ue.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66025bde378062017c3cff86","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Wexler","original_name":"Mark Wexler","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4649c3a368484e088725","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1172957","wikidata_id":"Q12124911","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yiCe8kJqqhaJGhGgIis6ITt8NED.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":678}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5884,"name":"life extension"},{"id":5976,"name":"multiculturalism"},{"id":4995,"name":"aging"},{"id":3721,"name":"health"},{"id":15070,"name":"forever"},{"id":15071,"name":"centenarian"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hamptons International Film Festival","release_date":"2009-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"How To Live Forever (Trailer)","key":"UZGDUFHhyko","published_at":"2011-04-07T17:33:27.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6b7c3a36854480063bb"}]}}}
