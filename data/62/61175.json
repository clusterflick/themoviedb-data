The band's early material has been compared by critics to Deep Purple, but by the mid 1980s they had moved to a more commercial heavy metal style. Whitesnake was named the 85th greatest hard rock band of all time by VH1.[1] Although for many years classed as an English rock band, all the members of the current incarnation of the band, except Coverdale, are American born.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whitesnake - Rough Ready An' Willing","video":true,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
