She's unhappy because the lord's daughters treat her like their servant. The country is in problems, because the prince is a dreamer and doesn't realize that his chancellor abuses his power. When the day nears the prince is forced by law to find a wife, a celebration on a frozen lake is arranged. Ella manages to skate on the lake for him too, hiding her identity. The prince falls in love with her, so he tries to find her. His chancellor attempts to hinder them, since he knows about Ella's critical thoughts.","popularity":0.5224,"poster_path":"/akbOLDQyOXiwZOggVXlLsJPYJ9K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114869,"logo_path":null,"name":"Patrola Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":18692,"logo_path":"/nZNzWVy6Da5r7WCuV8Mocwj2Ebe.png","name":"UFA Fernsehproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1996-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ice Princess","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":53955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katarina Witt","original_name":"Katarina Witt","popularity":0.2851,"profile_path":"/ysMepIbizcIGTZN0vnro0U5zsct.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ella","credit_id":"52fe4660c3a368484e08d5c9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Barker","original_name":"Christopher Barker","popularity":0.0834,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Prince","credit_id":"52fe4660c3a368484e08d5cd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans-Peter Minetti","original_name":"Hans-Peter Minetti","popularity":0.1164,"profile_path":"/2d2L5sFS59G0awAgfupSje4ki0r.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5a459ab5c3a368586c066401","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Desny","original_name":"Ivan Desny","popularity":0.2505,"profile_path":"/cf2mRMgj9XpWEHfBqRRc6h88vDz.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5a459abec3a368591606b7d8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Heinz Moser","original_name":"Hans Heinz Moser","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/fBSDHvYzctLjLmLeKIkIJwpldo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5a459aadc3a36858c506ba9b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vernon Dobtcheff","original_name":"Vernon Dobtcheff","popularity":0.5326,"profile_path":"/o3zjo0Q8BDJQFqHMIIaFbUnckBY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5a459aa39251411f510878e1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":22183,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gerhard Jakubowski","original_name":"Gerhard Jakubowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5a459adac3a368591606b7f8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1949598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gottfried von Bismarck","original_name":"Gottfried von Bismarck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5a459af80e0a264f3907547e","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Huston","original_name":"Danny Huston","popularity":1.6549,"profile_path":"/7Wdh73SltnllH4KVd64PvqKQ5NJ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4660c3a368484e08d5c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3305883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diether Dehm","original_name":"Diether Dehm","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/twwVuRRjbcH9INJ0P5GgguxHdTy.jpg","credit_id":"618d7549c9dbf90067600c63","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0112937","wikidata_id":"Q28377871","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1426,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/akbOLDQyOXiwZOggVXlLsJPYJ9K.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nGXUvO3T4LvGcQWUaw8G03GzzyL.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
