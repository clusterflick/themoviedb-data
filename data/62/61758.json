After attacking French television star reporters, his new target is television critics as represented by Daniel Schneidermann, host of the \"Arrêt sur images\" show. “Enfin pris ?” analyzes censure at work in television. It is also a thought-provoking look at how power changes people and the intimate forces between ambition and loyalty. A cruel, biting comedy from which no one really comes out unscathed.","popularity":0.1453,"poster_path":"/caAC7RLCqJbu8kaT4QJkt1QKWhI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enfin pris ?","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":234316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Paul Abribat","original_name":"Jean-Paul Abribat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4661c3a368484e08d8b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Bourdieu","original_name":"Pierre Bourdieu","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/oi1KS3a1LnJ8ldxQQpwZx24Hg0I.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4661c3a368484e08d8bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Bérégovoy","original_name":"Pierre Bérégovoy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4661c3a368484e08d8bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Carles","original_name":"Pierre Carles","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/AdUohXvcWns0dJC0ykPBmnlHCpD.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4661c3a368484e08d8c3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15135,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Delon","original_name":"Alain Delon","popularity":3.4161,"profile_path":"/dRPDxFehaVGbHojEUsCvqLSNfqH.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4661c3a368484e08d8c7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":234319,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Serge Halimi","original_name":"Serge Halimi","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4661c3a368484e08d8cb","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Lang","original_name":"Jack Lang","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/udyymrVmHTwwS1LusYTy113vizU.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4661c3a368484e08d8cf","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Schneidermann","original_name":"Daniel Schneidermann","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/8GEdeCbOkIkAcTuqkkDVhScxZwJ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4661c3a368484e08d8d3","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Carles","original_name":"Pierre Carles","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/AdUohXvcWns0dJC0ykPBmnlHCpD.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4661c3a368484e08d8ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71937,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Carles","original_name":"Pierre Carles","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/AdUohXvcWns0dJC0ykPBmnlHCpD.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4661c3a368484e08d8b3","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0333407","wikidata_id":"Q3054203","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/caAC7RLCqJbu8kaT4QJkt1QKWhI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1018}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
