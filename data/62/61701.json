After forecasting a large trembleor that will rock California within twenty-four hours, Conway cannot persuade the Governor to act. When the prediction proves true and further tests indicate that there are more quakes to come, Conway and Laura seek to perfect their device. Subsequent tests deep within Carlsbad Caverns discover an unknown element—E-112—that is responsible for the earthquakes and threatens to destroy the globe if it ever reaches the surface. The team determines that with only four weeks until Armageddon, the race is on to neutralize the killer element before it takes a devastating toll.","popularity":1.4695,"poster_path":"/3W6dOlUFPDIyKfhVOqYxGU5X8d6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3458,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clover Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1957-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Super-Quake Tilts Earth!","title":"The Night the World Exploded","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Το Τέλος του Κόσμου Πλησιάζει","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Leslie","original_name":"William Leslie","popularity":0.2055,"profile_path":"/pUyOo9lwpVW5keHdJNpHb9yMIBr.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dr. David Conway","credit_id":"52fe465ec3a368484e08cfef","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathryn Grant","original_name":"Kathryn Grant","popularity":0.3536,"profile_path":"/tgQ9cvlr90QvmeFdN6M8lidhPsL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Laura 'Hutch' Hutchinson","credit_id":"52fe465ec3a368484e08cfeb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tris Coffin","original_name":"Tris Coffin","popularity":0.5132,"profile_path":"/6ZHwIj24k7mkJYqcankVbXlKKaD.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Ellis Morton","credit_id":"52fe465ec3a368484e08cff3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raymond Greenleaf","original_name":"Raymond Greenleaf","popularity":0.1607,"profile_path":"/t8YlAW84OybwqhE2GRhrtj4LmNu.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gov.
