He fears the meetings will be frightfully dull, but things change when two amorous hippie girls take Timothy for a sail on the sea of love. Timothy goes middle-aged crazy, making a spectacle of himself in hippie clothes as he tries to fit into the swinging scene. Nude dips in the ocean are followed and preceded by wild parties as he tries to recapture the days of his flaming youth. After he feels remorse and embarrassment over his behavior, he calls on his wife to join him at the convention to rekindle their love in this lowbrow comedy. The British rock group The Pretty Things provides the music.","popularity":0.7932,"poster_path":"/nWYF0Hl9xBIpEq5Bt0cprCbQvBk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4579,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tigon British Film Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1969-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Yesterday's lover makes today's scene...","title":"What's Good for the Goose","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Girl Trouble","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Menahem Golan's What's Good for the Goose","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76379,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Wisdom","original_name":"Norman Wisdom","popularity":0.3338,"profile_path":"/pF2FKj6me3XuAw69EIk7JrQL0St.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Timothy Bartlett","credit_id":"52fe4649c3a368484e08855f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Geeson","original_name":"Sally Geeson","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":"/3UzWL6fD0yHgo7594nKWJyGHrCx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nikki","credit_id":"58389e9bc3a368492e00284b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Atkinson","original_name":"Sarah Atkinson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Meg","credit_id":"58389ea7c3a368782200193a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1236453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Bazely","original_name":"Sally Bazely","popularity":0.1493,"profile_path":"/5eP7G14j9QXHAwCI6B8wYLHF2da.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Margaret","credit_id":"58389eb8925141423900282b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1249216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Nichol","original_name":"Stuart Nichol","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Bank Manager","credit_id":"58389ec5c3a368494a0029be","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terence Alexander","original_name":"Terence Alexander","popularity":0.2822,"profile_path":"/5bY3OFb8VpW7ccNn6Q47z84js5M.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Frisby","credit_id":"657c61e87a3c52014e6be7a9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Lodge","original_name":"David Lodge","popularity":0.1605,"profile_path":"/rYb40i92d3qqMu9ioYdiT2ZM42X.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Porter","credit_id":"657c61f6564ec7011b21e429","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Lanchbury","original_name":"Karl Lanchbury","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":"/dKMHEnXCTdSaRMkHQlFyWjI6srv.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Pete","credit_id":"657c64eb8e2ba600ac8d9b87","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33008,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Menahem Golan","original_name":"Menahem Golan","popularity":0.3251,"profile_path":"/qGtHMLd4E7tRyw75H4lWTRelW7B.jpg","credit_id":"58389edb925141423c002990","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33008,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Menahem Golan","original_name":"Menahem Golan","popularity":0.3251,"profile_path":"/qGtHMLd4E7tRyw75H4lWTRelW7B.jpg","credit_id":"5b63d4459251414064041970","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2296561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorna Selwyn","original_name":"Lorna Selwyn","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc2f7ba0e0a2667bbedca30","department":"Directing","job":"Continuity"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0065205","wikidata_id":"Q7990766","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nMKvZL9mxJ5A6QNy5Kt8bgW9KJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nWYF0Hl9xBIpEq5Bt0cprCbQvBk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":178649,"name":"voyeurism"},{"id":241368,"name":"mid-life crisis"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
