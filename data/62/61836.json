Half of the century-old Tua railway, that circulates between Bragança e Mirandela, is shut down by a political decision. Fifteen years later, the train's whistle echoes in the memory of the people from Trás-os-Montes. This decision cut the development of the country and increased disparities between the coastal and inland of Portugal, making it the most centralist country in Western Europe. Now, the trains that still wind through the idyllic valley of Tua is threatened by a dam, which would flood what is considered one of the most beautiful railway lines of Europe. The people stood, isolated, in the only district in the country without a single motorway mile.","popularity":0.1192,"poster_path":"/60sAerGqoCDcaWOrTkEccQywFg1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16493,"logo_path":null,"name":"SIC Filmes","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2009-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The announcement to build a dam threatens the centuries-old railway line from Tua","title":"Pare, Escute, Olhe","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Stop, Listen, Look","type":"International"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Pelicano","original_name":"Jorge Pelicano","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/rXz8UHYB9UbJRgXnjEvmLUSSerK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4666c3a368484e08e9a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4902511,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Toni Lourenço","original_name":"Toni Lourenço","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/KWi0ry7cdGDYvKk9IoF5fHzLlb.jpg","credit_id":"66ca261461818c623be6228f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4902511,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Toni Lourenço","original_name":"Toni Lourenço","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/KWi0ry7cdGDYvKk9IoF5fHzLlb.jpg","credit_id":"66ca2623ebc2bd702ee3b8d5","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2754695,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rosa Teixeira da Silva","original_name":"Rosa Teixeira da Silva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f451da70d11f20034b3706a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Pelicano","original_name":"Jorge Pelicano","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/rXz8UHYB9UbJRgXnjEvmLUSSerK.jpg","credit_id":"5f451dc0fdc4fa0035b5ba52","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Pelicano","original_name":"Jorge Pelicano","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/rXz8UHYB9UbJRgXnjEvmLUSSerK.jpg","credit_id":"5f451ddd1d01910036da1510","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Pelicano","original_name":"Jorge Pelicano","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/rXz8UHYB9UbJRgXnjEvmLUSSerK.jpg","credit_id":"5f451e02813cb60037a201a1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Pelicano","original_name":"Jorge Pelicano","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/rXz8UHYB9UbJRgXnjEvmLUSSerK.jpg","credit_id":"5f451db071f09500337ea4aa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1896080,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Miguel Lima","original_name":"Miguel Lima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f451dd271f09500367f0226","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2754725,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Manuel Faria","original_name":"Manuel Faria","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/eeS5d0iHpVxhB2hmiRD8wbomML2.jpg","credit_id":"5f451df8cee4810037a88215","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":234470,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Pelicano","original_name":"Jorge Pelicano","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":"/rXz8UHYB9UbJRgXnjEvmLUSSerK.jpg","credit_id":"5f451e08965220003550a9d6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5284630,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francisco Faria","original_name":"Francisco Faria","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c858a28fca0c0b03e70175","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1634539","wikidata_id":"Q2052114","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/60sAerGqoCDcaWOrTkEccQywFg1.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer PARE, ESCUTE, OLHE PT","key":"9fOpnFLhN5g","published_at":"2010-04-06T15:23:54.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6b8c3a368544800643d"}]}}}
