The more I was shocked about how the disabled were depicted in this film the more I started to realize that in every non-disabled TV counterpart of this show (German TV shows like \"Popstars\" or \"Friedmann\" or the home shopping channels) its mentally \"non-handicapped\" participants are treated in a completely identical way: The total prostitution of the mind in front a huge TV audience at the expense of one's most important gifts one should hang on to: dignity. On the other hand one could completely understand people who are furious about \"exploiting\" these handicapped persons. But that's what Schlingensief's works are all about: shock people and don't care about those who cannot or will not try to get the message (if there is one).","popularity":0.1202,"poster_path":"/jLRCPyT7ArpMNbzQmcUV59mkhkK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17178,"logo_path":"/eXbcwmrHmVmgmRFPoYZfbLkt884.png","name":"Filmgalerie 451","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freakstars 3000","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Werner Brecht","original_name":"Werner Brecht","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4645c3a368484e0876ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":232331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanne Bredehöft","original_name":"Susanne Bredehöft","popularity":0.1719,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4645c3a368484e0876f1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilse Garzaner","original_name":"Ilse Garzaner","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4645c3a368484e0876f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2325025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Achim von Paczensky","original_name":"Achim von Paczensky","popularity":0.0966,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5cef838d92514177f2b87cdc","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18415,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Schlingensief","original_name":"Christoph Schlingensief","popularity":0.1366,"profile_path":"/dk4bVYUBW6sHUE29NFmbBS3PeUI.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4645c3a368484e0876e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18415,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christoph Schlingensief","original_name":"Christoph Schlingensief","popularity":0.1366,"profile_path":"/dk4bVYUBW6sHUE29NFmbBS3PeUI.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4645c3a368484e0876e9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0397431","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1124,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u8tAwSxvQUBpm0e1SjHNR8V19im.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":1124,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rWQh0XJozhsj9xtVvF7vwsiCudd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4pjQPKvvqDOTGe3YlMSoR9EwqNi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jLRCPyT7ArpMNbzQmcUV59mkhkK.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
