During all-night police interrogations she poured out a terrifying tale of systematic abuse, torture and even murder. Her tearful account described child sex orgies involving politicians and other members of the country's elite; a Belgian underworld that no one wanted to believe, least of all the establishment. For years there was a huge effort to discredit her evidence, but now in an exclusive interview, the policeman at the centre of her investigation has finally broken his silence. He claims that his enquiry was blocked - because it threatened to reveal too much.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Olenka Frenkiel Investigation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
