After extensively insulting the audience that goes to the cinema to forget its heteronomous life, the film becomes autobiographical, using images from the world of spectacle: advertising brochures, clips from feature films (Les enfants du paradis), comics, aerial footage of Paris, tracking shots through Venice, photographs of friends – all commented on by Debord, with an at times melancholy undertone: \"This Paris no longer exists.\" His assessment is that one of the great pleasures of his life has been the sensation of the passage of time, and as a witness to the disintegration of social order, he has loved his epoch.","popularity":0.0761,"poster_path":"/scz363a4qKgxLYCX6L0JvgoWRUV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1978-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Spin Around the Night Consumed by the Fire","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":18,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":233490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erkan Duygu","original_name":"Erkan Duygu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Atesin etrafinda donen kiz","credit_id":"52fe465cc3a368484e08c921","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4510798,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rasit Tahtaci","original_name":"Rasit Tahtaci","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"65ba8cb9f90b1900e3042be2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Debord","original_name":"Guy Debord","popularity":0.1028,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe465cc3a368484e08c91d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56458,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guy Debord","original_name":"Guy Debord","popularity":0.1028,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe465cc3a368484e08c927","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2552152,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stéphanie Granel","original_name":"Stéphanie Granel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bcc025fc31d30092c5c89e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3608516,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"André Mrugalski","original_name":"André Mrugalski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bcc02ca6e2d20083e252b4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0240610","wikidata_id":"Q1059989","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":912,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bFb0JG8MBk82ADqvyxWBdg4idJN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1622}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1458,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cT8fzdIK042cq8TApnkcMFQZqMX.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1015},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1386,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/WA9HBXVlBUiKsjhD0mpiccydh2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":924},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/scz363a4qKgxLYCX6L0JvgoWRUV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
