This rousing NFL Films production follows their entire season, beginning with a horrendous 1-3 record and the loss of quarterback Drew Bledsoe before they kept finding ways to win in a season that couldn't help but be emotional. Playing when America was attacked and went to war held a special meaning for the Patriots, who at one game paid tribute to teammate Joe Andruzzi's three brothers who work as New York City firefighters. The Patriots' postseason victories, including a memorable overtime upset in a snowstorm against the fearsome Raiders, are dramatically depicted. And 17 minutes of highlights from the Super Bowl game against the heavily favored St. Louis Rams are presented with all the devotion that only NFL Films can bring.","popularity":0.3196,"poster_path":"/3R2ZDLahApDGXo9UWG4hDqPQqrS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"We are all Patriots","title":"Super Bowl XXXVI Champions: New England Patriots","video":true,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Brady","original_name":"Tom Brady","popularity":0.4128,"profile_path":"/tTZryV0b0C1CxnHB0skDludmfAl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5eb73e6f7d2bc1001dfc6524","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1969505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Belichick","original_name":"Bill Belichick","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":"/nFWRHSFDOHB1L4XxuGteA9Gfw60.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5eb73e78bbe1dd0020819a8f","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Alk23abqfOWaXdYySmzRuEinFtx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3R2ZDLahApDGXo9UWG4hDqPQqrS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x4G4VNsj0NpvFPxjvz9EsAJh3FA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-03-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
