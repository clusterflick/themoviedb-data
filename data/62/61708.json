Otis at Monterey","overview":"Renowned documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker captures Otis Redding in his ascendancy, singing at the historic Monterey International Pop Festival in June 1967. Comedian Tom Smothers introduces Redding to a crowd that is leaving -- until Redding grabs them with his charged rendition of \"Shake.\" Redding's performance also includes \"Respect\" (which he wrote), \"I've Been Loving You Too Long,\" \"Satisfaction,\" and \"Try a Little Tenderness.\" Tragically, Redding died in a plane crash six months later. An innovative filmmaker who started in the 1950s making experimental films, Pennebaker garnered an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary Feature in 1993 for The War Room, his behind-the-scenes look at Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign. His other subjects have included Norman Mailer, Bob Dylan, and David Bowie.","popularity":1.2106,"poster_path":"/wyd0OdBxYK3m3DFf5xtBowd7Oe7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11489,"logo_path":null,"name":"HBO/Cinemax Documentary","origin_country":"US"},{"id":79233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pennebaker Associates Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shake!
