More than standup comedy, LONG STORY SHORT is a hilarious blend of incisive observation, sharp commentary, and Colin's channeling of the personalities of the past. From Socrates to Snooki, Quinn is at his satirical best, taking on the attitudes, appetites and bad habits that toppled the world's most powerful nations. Long Story Short proves that throughout human history, the joke has always been on us.","popularity":0.6131,"poster_path":"/vBEKUdBfVDwGe6pnYrrkh9A4zzG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colin Quinn: Long Story Short","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Quinn","original_name":"Colin Quinn","popularity":0.4917,"profile_path":"/yj0M3D1bQDxmIyIuUfFBVHucEtP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe464fc3a368484e089aa7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87671,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Moffitt","original_name":"John Moffitt","popularity":0.1078,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53351900925141444e003ae4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Seinfeld","original_name":"Jerry Seinfeld","popularity":0.868,"profile_path":"/ajmOd1zbf4XtDJw29nXocuMI80b.jpg","credit_id":"533519149251414454003b99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Quinn","original_name":"Colin Quinn","popularity":0.4917,"profile_path":"/yj0M3D1bQDxmIyIuUfFBVHucEtP.jpg","credit_id":"533519249251414454003b9b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1831611","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vBEKUdBfVDwGe6pnYrrkh9A4zzG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
