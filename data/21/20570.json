One of the bestselling albums of all time, RUMOURS' impeccable songwriting, lush vocal harmonies, and polished production stand as testament to the band's cohesive powers--a fact made even more remarkable by the romantic tensions roiling amongst its members at the time (Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were ending their long-term romantic relationship; Christine and John McVie were getting a divorce). This episode of the CLASSIC ALBUMS series recounts the making of Fleetwood Mac's career-making opus through interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and live performances of timeless gems such as \"Don't Stop,\" \"Dreams,\"\"Go Your Own Way,\" \"You Make Loving Fun,\" \"The Chain,\" and more.","popularity":1.3256,"poster_path":"/dVXx9kg7EWahLqsOhwz8PXbiTZp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":50460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Isis Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":124885,"logo_path":null,"name":"Daniel Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":23946,"logo_path":"/nMSb08CGf7EPLaY6SDlOknlS9ZP.png","name":"NCRV","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":10692,"logo_path":"/qFS7NEIS3fiBW1wi6VMAcwAsFCX.png","name":"VH1","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Classic Albums","title":"Classic Albums: Fleetwood Mac - Rumours","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Classic Albums: Fleetwood Mac: Rumours","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stevie Nicks","original_name":"Stevie Nicks","popularity":0.3097,"profile_path":"/n8gLNEXq7GNO4gH4MDsvYOlwuLE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fecef6c002134003c9ba4f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Fleetwood","original_name":"Mick Fleetwood","popularity":0.2004,"profile_path":"/1m9fHO7fFLf9qJ3Y5NH84Ph5MJv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fecef7931644b003e09c77a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine McVie","original_name":"Christine McVie","popularity":0.0974,"profile_path":"/icAE9tk2bMWuhQRIVHTaOBmVaaP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fecefa007291c0040e304a2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John McVie","original_name":"John McVie","popularity":0.076,"profile_path":"/xRstRdSd3Lx15JWGyjeDvMOIQaK.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fecefa8f18ce7003ffd7e5f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lindsey Buckingham","original_name":"Lindsey Buckingham","popularity":0.196,"profile_path":"/nghrXAFaZxnY5wkGOmZqbyWRoPe.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5fecefb8002134003c9ba533","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5258594,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Caillat","original_name":"Ken Caillat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67b6d097ed0bbcc50f655ca8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0180697","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1040,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9hX4I3qtf5irVJxaNFYMbuqOPyj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1848},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1688,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g94gFOpj3TIMLMpBJZqxSr6lLwh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jXnByzVxj6zcU9D8DczBnCbepZz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/or0l8s4gwX4E42SavdviArM4937.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dVXx9kg7EWahLqsOhwz8PXbiTZp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1285,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rdYY5iV6ff8WtrokQZozaJU4N2w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1830,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/slxL55DHNtGBSeol4jpbyoTfGpZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1220}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18001,"name":"rock band"},{"id":196067,"name":"blues rock"},{"id":197207,"name":"classic albums"},{"id":281554,"name":"rock"},{"id":340229,"name":"fleetwood mac"},{"id":340230,"name":"rumours"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB","release_date":"1997-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
