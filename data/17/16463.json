It was taken in the garden of Oakwood Grange, the Whitley family house in Roundhay, Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire (UK), possibly on 14 October 1888. The film shows Adolphe Le Prince (Le Prince's son), Mrs. Sarah Whitley (Le Prince's mother-in-law), Joseph Whitley, and Miss Harriet Hartley walking around in circles, laughing to themselves, and staying within the area framed by the camera. The Roundhay Garden Scene was recorded at 12 frames per second and runs for 2.11 seconds.","popularity":1.9599,"poster_path":"/qI9eTP3NpJlxTk3oMBvfz8Awwkw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48026,"logo_path":null,"name":"Whitley Partners","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1888-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roundhay Garden Scene","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":221,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"El jardín de Roundhay","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolphe Le Prince","original_name":"Adolphe Le Prince","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe46d69251416c7508534f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Whitley","original_name":"Joseph Whitley","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe46d69251416c75085353","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":80646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Whitley","original_name":"Sarah Whitley","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe46d69251416c75085357","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1728882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Hartley","original_name":"Annie Hartley","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself (Harriet Hartley)","credit_id":"586324f3c3a3680ab6001828","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":569209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Aimé Augustin Le Prince","original_name":"Louis Aimé Augustin Le Prince","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":"/h9m1UrMeeJRor9fxBtawCcW0Atv.jpg","credit_id":"675af7895c42a8c6ed8d06b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0392728","wikidata_id":"Q267176","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xDL0mSmWbywKk7oHj7PSRUX5uWM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":790,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2uUw3Fm9pP0zJzE9u4B7nwJLmiO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":3,"width":1404}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qI9eTP3NpJlxTk3oMBvfz8Awwkw.jpg","vote_average":7.19,"vote_count":7,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/421oRlZukE6xyMYJDdUXbad6qlh.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":506},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gYcv8TlWL493o8RZqFAX2bgKJvd.jpg","vote_average":0.958,"vote_count":4,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":811,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9LPDau0LSwIj2mtGtAFrDAmEwlu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":541},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":990,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/QHgGx9OYlbp97n9tJcqQHmDK0F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":660},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1010,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fbkobaH4BmDiNbC5LDZhQC8Vl6h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":673},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":990,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pzhZ88xrLnfQbtWIeg5bQlOTxW6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":660},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":990,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8NRgAQd6m99nYie0G5Ip6bRzeCm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":660},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1487,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mSv5jMYIkUW2nkr7ZTQdxhWNs36.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":991},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7oKL9P5EsqSsGuPMDYn5KiYzf2j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":816,"name":"walking"},{"id":2656,"name":"hat"},{"id":2105,"name":"garden"},{"id":15126,"name":"historical"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1888-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
