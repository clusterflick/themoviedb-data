Interspersed between ample vintage footage of Bukowski’s poetry readings are interviews with the poet’s fans including such legendary figures such as Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Joyce Fante (wife of John), Bono, and Harry Dean Stanton.  Filmed in grainy black and white by Bukowski’s friend, Taylor Hackford, due to lack of funding, the old films edited into this movie paint Bukowski’s life of boozing and brawling romantically, securing Bukowski’s legendary status.","popularity":1.1249,"poster_path":"/84jdtVpKSgyGpBy9fdeQZWXiqeI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bukowski: Born Into This","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":49,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67562,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Bukowski","original_name":"Charles Bukowski","popularity":0.2255,"profile_path":"/jHKXGjR60oYp5k0hNiU10VNQg6P.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"582731a4c3a368360b01cb26","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Dean Stanton","original_name":"Harry Dean Stanton","popularity":1.4043,"profile_path":"/197UiLVdxPOv8196sqmUpJzOQB5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"582731ab9251417b2901b1a2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Penn","original_name":"Sean Penn","popularity":2.54,"profile_path":"/9glqNTVpFpdN1nFklKaHPUyCwR6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"582731b3c3a36836080190e1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bono","original_name":"Bono","popularity":0.6342,"profile_path":"/r1jCFctRrEAHBHOyJun8rWCH0AD.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"582731bac3a36836080190e4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1707435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Bukowski","original_name":"Linda Bukowski","popularity":0.1633,"profile_path":"/cZdE0Ipgaws6H0ouA2kauIhABQq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58273301c3a368360401bb11","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1707436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pam Miller","original_name":"Pam Miller","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5827330e9251417b2901b257","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18596,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Taylor Hackford","original_name":"Taylor Hackford","popularity":0.3294,"profile_path":"/aAP9RYT7XxUiC2NZL9Hi2gEdxGB.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5827331bc3a368360f01c390","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbet Schroeder","original_name":"Barbet Schroeder","popularity":0.5297,"profile_path":"/rwhqq7bmhwc7Wjq0j2KbEZOIJOz.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"58273322c3a368361401acac","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Waits","original_name":"Tom Waits","popularity":0.3419,"profile_path":"/uxDkURjzHnaglIH2YRWUMJjoDx.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5b5d6c050e0a262e980253b3","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2094830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael D.
