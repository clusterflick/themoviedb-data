The wonderfully talented cast, headed by the Riverdance Irish Dance Company, bewitchingly spins (and stomps) its Celtic folk choreography featuring numerous breathless solos by Michael Flatley (since departed) and Jean Butler. The mellifluous Riverdance Orchestra boasts Davy Spillane, who coaxes plaintive lamentations out of a peculiar instrument that resembles a bagpipe in a metal leg brace. For Enya fans, there is the sound-alike choral group Anuna, who casts a similarly New Age-style vocal spell. Also thrown into the mix are such disparate folk traditions as American gospel and Spanish flamenco. Though it's only 70 minutes long, Riverdance is repetitive by half. But judging from the ecstatic audience ovations and the continued foot-stomping during and after the curtain calls, too much is still not enough. --Richard Natale","popularity":0.2597,"poster_path":"/fSWLhE3H586e9gbH2h2B9CfyL9y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÃ‰","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Riverdance: The Show","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Riverdance - Die Show","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Flatley","original_name":"Michael Flatley","popularity":0.1091,"profile_path":"/mZnA06HylCYQDNkFhgh8L75f5o9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lead Dancer","credit_id":"52fe46a49251416c7507ebc7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Butler","original_name":"Jean Butler","popularity":0.0949,"profile_path":"/8runBID7X5JvScb1930k7a2ZbDj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Lead Dancer","credit_id":"52fe46a49251416c7507ebd1","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":140263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John McColgan","original_name":"John McColgan","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe46a49251416c7507ebcd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43623,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bill Whelan","original_name":"Bill Whelan","popularity":0.095,"profile_path":"/UCgj3X1vPKmemAaocGPlDuBt8M.jpg","credit_id":"66007650197de40163176502","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0136491","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pflhSGygADIiXKbsokycKi2Las8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fSWLhE3H586e9gbH2h2B9CfyL9y.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":544},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/v5Lf7jQnmgT3jcN0CCtin3Y6yFM.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":242963,"name":"irish dance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
