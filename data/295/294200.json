The friendship comes under pressure during a dance audition in Paris, where one clearly is superior to the other. A unique film with the passion for dance as a binder for an unusual friendship and countryside as surprisingly natural playing field. Set up by choreographer Mourad Merzouki, the founder of a hip-hop circus school, director of a dance academy and widely loved ambassador for the French streetdance.","popularity":0.2559,"poster_path":"/8HqQMxOAVeFH3SltMNw3Vgt4Lt5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20662,"logo_path":"/rxfxm2P7zJdUsXB9d5Zrg9DOXfd.png","name":"TV5 Monde","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1028,"logo_path":null,"name":"GMT Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ceux qui dansent sur la tête","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvie Testud","original_name":"Sylvie Testud","popularity":0.7387,"profile_path":"/yafOAmaZkJ8BOEWLoQcWJVx2EYT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Catherine","credit_id":"544b57630e0a2674890062b5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Finnegan Oldfield","original_name":"Finnegan Oldfield","popularity":0.3945,"profile_path":"/mvc8BnamGxAyU4gfe5K7TvgB9OZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Matthieu dit «Frenzy»","credit_id":"544b57970e0a2674890062be","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Azerot","original_name":"Alain Azerot","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":"/nUPBE8sMzkVMgjnfBt1goztQzT3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Vincent Sylla","credit_id":"544b576f0e0a267b200012c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thierry Barbet","original_name":"Thierry Barbet","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/zlo1Vlsvs5g9hxDFhsTs9XvwVoy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jean Verdier","credit_id":"544b577d0e0a2651b300163c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-François Stévenin","original_name":"Jean-François Stévenin","popularity":0.2535,"profile_path":"/4NjAxLYSPlIqOkxJruq5njTUmpX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Alain","credit_id":"544b578a0e0a267486006302","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":54325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice de Lencquesaing","original_name":"Alice de Lencquesaing","popularity":0.1626,"profile_path":"/oqF5V8CT75nHDiLcsC6rHqN7vW.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Emilie","credit_id":"544b57a4c3a3680fb80063fa","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1377407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freddy Kimps","original_name":"Freddy Kimps","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Louis dit «Syl»","credit_id":"544b57b10e0a2630f9000642","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1377408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aline Bourgoin","original_name":"Aline Bourgoin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mireille Verdier","credit_id":"544b57c0c3a3680fae0061d0","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":979621,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Magaly Richard-Serrano","original_name":"Magaly Richard-Serrano","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/tkFgVR9xySCUzitgTyiimjg2xUQ.jpg","credit_id":"54204ac80e0a2617a2002d7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1377405,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jérôme Bensoussan","original_name":"Jérôme Bensoussan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"544b573a0e0a2674890062ac","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3694638","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8HqQMxOAVeFH3SltMNw3Vgt4Lt5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Arte","release_date":"2014-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
