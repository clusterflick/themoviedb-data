A critical view of a society which survived the war, won its independence but still struggles with human equality. An insightful portrait of a Balkan village, of a patriarchal microcosm, and of its mayor who desperately wants to control the village life. Of husbands who feel forced to behave strong, but act against their own emotional interest. A reflection of rituals which not only show gender inequality, but also the absence of freedom of expression within the male community.","popularity":0.1232,"poster_path":"/2Enlmk5heBkaSZJ6vcovXSYXEDp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22028,"logo_path":"/sL5udH4n7YbCuHJ4XxUyliWTJw9.png","name":"NiKo Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":68351,"logo_path":"/5iI8qbtcBoiklodCyJb0Srvllma.png","name":"ISSTRA Creative Factory","origin_country":"XK"},{"id":68352,"logo_path":null,"name":"CMB Productions","origin_country":"XK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XK","name":"Kosovo"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Windows and a Hanging","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1453380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irena Cahani","original_name":"Irena Cahani","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lushe","credit_id":"56503e55c3a368070f0068a0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":239192,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luan Jaha","original_name":"Luan Jaha","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/fve2K4wMoBTHSl7xaN9YmyQHU3g.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Uka","credit_id":"56503e5dc3a3680716006f22","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donat Qosja","original_name":"Donat Qosja","popularity":0.0909,"profile_path":"/2nwEbCZxQMDa3ww5leV5gsHyzX7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sokol","credit_id":"56503e67c3a3680708006b9b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1527296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xhevat Qorraj","original_name":"Xhevat Qorraj","popularity":0.0892,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Alush","credit_id":"56503e72c3a3680716006f26","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1314189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonora Mehmetaj","original_name":"Leonora Mehmetaj","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Nifa","credit_id":"56503e7dc3a368070a0067f1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1538923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doresa Rexha","original_name":"Doresa Rexha","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/jsHqjYo3j16wjNorYTbbgftf8QJ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Drita","credit_id":"56503e91c3a3680708006ba2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirjana Karanović","original_name":"Mirjana Karanović","popularity":0.2255,"profile_path":"/srev6gJelsMQYDQKtKqQ23vMnOe.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"The journalist","credit_id":"56503eaa925141645f002b8e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lyra Xhoci","original_name":"Lyra Xhoci","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"The interpreter 1","credit_id":"56503eb892514164c0002983","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sindi Citaku","original_name":"Sindi Citaku","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"The interpreter 2","credit_id":"56503eca925141645f002b98","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1366915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isa Qosja","original_name":"Isa Qosja","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54216cf0c3a36818cf0015e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538922,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Zymber Kelmendi","original_name":"Zymber Kelmendi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56503e459251414b07006b98","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2728458","wikidata_id":"Q18170523","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2Enlmk5heBkaSZJ6vcovXSYXEDp.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5KbEBlJfpKAt3dvktwCqguMQSSB.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
