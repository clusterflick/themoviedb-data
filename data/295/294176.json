After Dieter dies in a car accident, Carola finds out that he was gay and had been in a relationship with the much younger lawyer Tobias Volperius for six years. Deeply shaken by this discovery, she withdraws from the outside world and tries to drown her sorrow in alcohol. When she attempts suicide, it is Tobias who finds and saves her.
