Struggling to reconcile the evidence with his once held religious views, Peter turns to his uncle, Josh Sanders, a retired scientist and a man of strong Christian faith. Meanwhile, Sarah Pennington seeks protection for her young daughter, Kara, believing the extraterrestrials are bent on abducting the gifted nine-year-old as they did Sarah's husband three years earlier. When the four are brought together by Ethan, a mysterious stranger, Peter and Sarah wrestle with their own beliefs as Josh seeks to convince them of the truth. It becomes clear that Kara has a very special gift-one that can expose the true nature of the extraterrestrials.","popularity":0.2586,"poster_path":"/pWVJJxGTG3fyowJzPb3vIc99f4A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111544,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ensign Media","origin_country":""},{"id":111000,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vision Video Gateway Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Watchers: Revelation","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carissa Dallis","original_name":"Carissa Dallis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Kara Pennington","credit_id":"5f022a01f031740038533d40","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2697815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Gaylor","original_name":"David Gaylor","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Joshua Sanders","credit_id":"5f022a18dd2589003a9c7b1a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2177771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyler Trent","original_name":"Tyler Trent","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ethan Ward","credit_id":"5f022a2bebb99d00367f2139","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1856268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyle Hotz","original_name":"Kyle Hotz","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Bana","credit_id":"5f022a3ca284eb003695290c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1677679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Williams","original_name":"Annie Williams","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mia Andrews","credit_id":"5f022a557caa470035e16fd2","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Dallis","original_name":"Tom Dallis","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f02298ef0317400365d744b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1440332,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Dallis","original_name":"Tom Dallis","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f02299a7caa470036e073b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2512528","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/txnOnS4rSN088juUiQ6OpuMVJIg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pWVJJxGTG3fyowJzPb3vIc99f4A.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":640},{"aspect_ratio":0.753,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fru2pdKIzJ6PJXekFg21ev8N2qU.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":723}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":253695,"name":"christian film"},{"id":285961,"name":"low budget"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Watchers: Revelation (2013) | Trailer | Kaitlin Lory | Carissa Dallis | Titus Wolverton","key":"qgzYbtoFWN4","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-06-19T15:02:37.000Z","id":"65e303eab7a154016377d93f"}]}}}
