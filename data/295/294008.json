The theme is Satanism and the linking thread is a recreation of what is supposedly the real-life case of a murder and attempted murder of two Munich teenage men by a quartet of girls who had been dabbling in devil worship. During the ensuing trial, the lawyer resorts to dilatory tactics while the hearing is frequently interrupted by the girls breaking into incantation, temper tantrums or shivery fits ostensibly bearing on demonic possession.  When the subject of the Manson killings is brought up, the most obnoxious of the defendants breaks in indignantly, claiming that Sharon Tate’s “execution” was justified as she posed dangers to the Satanic community.","popularity":0.6876,"poster_path":"/mHnv75TuxG5AvTma7vERAJdW9Qy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33599,"logo_path":null,"name":"Iltis Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1979-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ekstase - Der Prozeß gegen die Satansmädchen","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Ekstase - Horrortrip der Satans-Sekte","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Extasis","type":"video title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":957035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Magle","original_name":"Anne Magle","popularity":7.417,"profile_path":"/bP5Am2X003cNvGg858w9pXtod8g.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"541e47690e0a2604ac000ecd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1366092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joana John","original_name":"Joana John","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"541e477c0e0a2604ac000ed1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1366093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Peters","original_name":"Sharon Peters","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"541e4787c3a36801ea000998","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renate Hess","original_name":"Renate Hess","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"541e47930e0a26124a009e38","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1366094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hedy Bader","original_name":"Hedy Bader","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"541e479e0e0a260754000e09","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":46182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilse Peternell","original_name":"Ilse Peternell","popularity":0.1138,"profile_path":"/7ELpjtpKhu26qecQ6Zcnc1DIYGv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"541e47abc3a36801ad0099c3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans Schellbach","original_name":"Hans Schellbach","popularity":0.0566,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"541e47b6c3a36829fe000cc2","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":36893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Ullrich","original_name":"Walter Ullrich","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"541e47c9c3a36871320055fb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1366095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathias Eysen","original_name":"Mathias Eysen","popularity":0.1317,"profile_path":"/xngH4AgLLmGeGDgBI3klHmF0RZd.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"541e47e0c3a36801a900994c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1169866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronny Tanner","original_name":"Ronny Tanner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"541e47ec0e0a26124a009e44","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1366097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kent O.
