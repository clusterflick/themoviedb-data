Maori folklore speaks of the 'Turehu' or 'Patupaiarehe: a small faery folk, 3 to 4 foot tall. Often fair haired or occassionally witnessed with red hair and with green or blue eyes and pale skin. He engaged a camera crew and went into the bush to find out. Never in a million years did he expect to be rewarded so generously when the crew captured a supernatural anomaly on camera. Not only that, during the filming, local farmers, Maori Iwi and Kaumatua came forward with information and testimonials that have made the film an extraordinary experience that will change the way people look at the 'unseen'.","popularity":0.083,"poster_path":"/oFZyfvzahJ5mpIw1RpyG198uGdE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voices from the Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3312818","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oFZyfvzahJ5mpIw1RpyG198uGdE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
