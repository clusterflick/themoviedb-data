It took place on September 21, 2014 at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee.[1] It was the eighth annual Night of Champions event.  The theme of the pay-per-view was that every championship would be defended on that night. This was the first pay-per-view to feature the latest version of championship belts, which were introduced the night after SummerSlam, such as the new WWE logo on the WWE World Heavyweight Championship (while the Big Gold Belt was retired), whereas the other championship belts have minor modifications.","popularity":3.0273,"poster_path":"/52VeLXnvaVYS44AhQdtx2Fh10Bd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146598,"logo_path":"/6B6g6PR19RWX4UVi8Q46lZbwb2L.png","name":"World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":166,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WWE Night of Champions 2014","video":true,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brock Lesnar","original_name":"Brock Lesnar","popularity":0.4257,"profile_path":"/swQ9CHv35rEXfRw44RWDet8ajEP.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Brock Lesnar","credit_id":"54200420c3a3687996001de5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Cena","original_name":"John Cena","popularity":7.6198,"profile_path":"/rgB2eIOt7WyQjdgJCOuESdDlrjg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"John Cena","credit_id":"5420042dc3a368799c001c45","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Irvine","original_name":"Chris Irvine","popularity":0.8465,"profile_path":"/tXAr23l6sLoFjfcIxY4jsUcYqK7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Chris Jericho","credit_id":"625495d5da9ef200ae748d77","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randy Orton","original_name":"Randy Orton","popularity":0.7329,"profile_path":"/efN2loWLhV0x0HIfyZP7Kio8Qp8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Randy Orton","credit_id":"625495e7d9554b009b3e84ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colby Lopez","original_name":"Colby Lopez","popularity":0.6098,"profile_path":"/4qfvydgEn1ONViLI7d3mDFKAChq.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Seth Rollins","credit_id":"62549619447f9c485e1edbb7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1318951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miroslav Barnyashev","original_name":"Miroslav Barnyashev","popularity":0.4404,"profile_path":"/kZmy5vIJWy2J8jXd7hzXfSvsTJ8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Rusev","credit_id":"625495faa0b6b51c58a1eaef","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":565421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Henry","original_name":"Mark Henry","popularity":0.9931,"profile_path":"/cvE0cob8gdCgm9V2ecvPwtEXvuT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mark Henry","credit_id":"62549606fcb8cc00673e78ae","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":969097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikki Garcia","original_name":"Nikki Garcia","popularity":0.6019,"profile_path":"/uEheUI1YE6Isp99eoifGKza7dXx.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Nikki Bella","credit_id":"6254971227d9cc009d86340d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":491896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brie Garcia","original_name":"Brie Garcia","popularity":0.463,"profile_path":"/cO0TojGWEbeHUPCqe1u2WrC6gZI.jpg","cast_id":26,"character":"Brie Bella","credit_id":"62958eeef2cf250064ed7b5e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Mizanin","original_name":"Mike Mizanin","popularity":1.1582,"profile_path":"/t38oIcpIKfiVr3W3pOTK9bErdpw.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"The Miz","credit_id":"62549646447f9c7113a82e9c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Nemeth","original_name":"Nick Nemeth","popularity":0.4577,"profile_path":"/ffXSFc1PEtepItMTPobrT7pWOn5.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Dolph Ziggler","credit_id":"62549653b6c2646804b896b7","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237746,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Farrelly","original_name":"Stephen Farrelly","popularity":0.3519,"profile_path":"/5kJR6YcOcDyQC6wfxf00B9qCzoU.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Sheamus","credit_id":"625496672f1be0722df2c414","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Castagnoli","original_name":"Claudio Castagnoli","popularity":0.1852,"profile_path":"/23LyZUJHA8VViWRJ3XamNMfZp60.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Cesaro","credit_id":"6254967e389da1009a479384","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1170015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"April Jeanette Mendez","original_name":"April Jeanette Mendez","popularity":0.626,"profile_path":"/6YYaZQWgCtOyDSlFgXv3NYSnokh.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"A.J.
