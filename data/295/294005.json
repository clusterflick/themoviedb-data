The lovers go on the run, but get separated. Bent on revenge, Leonora's brother Don Carlo, hunts them down.\r Verdi painted an immense canvas with this dark but tuneful opera, vividly brought to life in John Dexter’s production, with sets by the great Eugene Berman. The legendary Leontyne Price is seen in one of her greatest roles, Leonora. Price’s soaring voice encompasses every nuance of Leonora’s emotion as she moves from joy through resignation to ultimate heartbreak. James Levine’s brilliant leading of the Met orchestra and chorus is a lesson in Verdi style. Giuseppe Giacomini is Alvaro, the man Leonora loves, and Leo Nucci is Don Carlo, the dark instrument of their Fate.","popularity":0.4948,"poster_path":"/iRu2TSiNakEMLGQxcJB6inhSA4t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1984-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Forza del Destino","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1248656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leontyne Price","original_name":"Leontyne Price","popularity":0.096,"profile_path":"/4ItBqAJCC5q7pWNXLbB6tOuX2Uw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Donna Leonora","credit_id":"541e216dc3a36871320051a2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1366081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppe Giacomini","original_name":"Giuseppe Giacomini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Don Alvaro","credit_id":"541e217ac3a3683af8006e07","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Nucci","original_name":"Leo Nucci","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":"/fre6T3D9ba2DwpOz3mxnetRr8JW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Don Carlo","credit_id":"541e21890e0a26124600a029","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1576778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bonaldo Giaiotti","original_name":"Bonaldo Giaiotti","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Padre Guardiano","credit_id":"5eeadd23b04605003307e762","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1003168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isola Jones","original_name":"Isola Jones","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":"/yMySDw2JEIMyzVonSeH59uc0EIj.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Preziosilla","credit_id":"5eeadd122dda890034b84052","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enrico Fissore","original_name":"Enrico Fissore","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Fra Melitone","credit_id":"5eeadd339661fc00385becd7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diane Kesling","original_name":"Diane Kesling","popularity":0.0958,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Curra","credit_id":"5eeadd432dda890035b8154c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1225853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Laciura","original_name":"Anthony Laciura","popularity":0.172,"profile_path":"/3qKO0ww9zhWJekeA4ag2i2w4XAk.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Trabuco","credit_id":"5eeadd699661fc00365cbbc3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1564237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Darrenkamp","original_name":"John Darrenkamp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"A surgeon","credit_id":"5eecceb89661fc003660cdf3","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1102288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Courtney","original_name":"James Courtney","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":"/olNxjayI7iK6OCGu7eRj46klwvr.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"The Mayor of Hornachuelos","credit_id":"5eeccf57c5ada50032d68870","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1366080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Vernon","original_name":"Richard Vernon","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"The Marquis of Calatrava","credit_id":"541e215d0e0a261235009faa","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248678,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Levine","original_name":"James Levine","popularity":0.1985,"profile_path":"/p6ujBSZMKTc2zNCytIvvg9NKL1D.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self -
