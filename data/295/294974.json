After 61 years of hegemony by the Colorado Party and by the dictator Stroessner, this unexpected victory came as a political miracle. But politics is not for saints and the dream turns into a nightmare. Power and Impotence tells the utopia of political change: the adventure of common men accessing power to try and challenge the system from within. In a political thriller settled in stranger-than-fiction Paraguay, we follow their hopes and disappointments from a unique behind-the-scene point of view, until the tragic ending. An uncommon film, an authentic modern Shakespearean drama about power.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Power and Impotence, a drama in 3 acts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1367603,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Recalde Miranda","original_name":"Anna Recalde Miranda","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"542441b60e0a263b6e003c9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3961640","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
