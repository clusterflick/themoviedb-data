The camera gazes at Jonas, implicating the viewer in the work and further, with her body. Her intentional de-synchronization of the monitor's receiving and transmitting frequencies results in the on-screen image's repeated vertical descent. Creating a sense of fragmentation, the vertical roll relentlessly pounds at the images of the artist as she moves through a series of performed identities. Characterized a \"disjunctive self portrait\" by the Electronic Arts Intermix, the image content of the work is strongly mediated by the mirror-like function of the camera, scrutinized by the lens and subjected to violence by the vertical roll.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":"/q7O5OCI13TObUQi7VVol7MSik6j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vertical Roll","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Organic Honey's Veritcal Roll","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1309429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Jonas","original_name":"Joan Jonas","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/8rvC6EidwNnIVQvQgjmVdVNbTrp.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Organic Honey","credit_id":"5421c6b10e0a260a13000434","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1309429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Jonas","original_name":"Joan Jonas","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/8rvC6EidwNnIVQvQgjmVdVNbTrp.jpg","credit_id":"5421c6bfc3a368353d0003e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8759726","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/q7O5OCI13TObUQi7VVol7MSik6j.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ak7ZlezAFaCJdnFgTqz9zvoIval.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":782,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wHwl6NaINuwhMcNEr11Gv5hicxU.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":521}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
