Between Cannes to the local fast food joint, with a taste for Ted Lapidus designs and a thing about plastic bags, Estherka is the heroine of this comic documentary, the portrait of a woman in the twilight of her life and at the dawn of her career As well as recording the incredible career of this 85 year-old débutant, I wanted to tell the story of her entire life. I had started filming Esther Gorintin before she started acting: her journey through the past century, her memories, her storytelling style, her unique relationship with the world around her, and her very special relationship with her son Armand. Here are the reasons why I followed her for more than ten years.","popularity":0.1873,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Estherka","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":229466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther
