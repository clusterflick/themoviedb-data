Once you have passed the line of demarcation you just know you've crossed the tracks because things get a little grimier, a little more industrial. If you travel there to smoke or to buy, the main place is the Vice Club. Cigarette Girl becomes an angel of death when she stops smoking and starts killing on the third day to alleviate her acute psychological withdrawal manifested primarily by the ghost of a cowboy who is always on her back to keep smoking. Cigarette Girl would rather kill than smoke.","popularity":0.0561,"poster_path":"/20Pzd1UtMY0oSSYNlMNH3M5MyWI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"She'd Kill for A Smoke","title":"Cigarette Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":186104,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Michael McCarthy","original_name":"John Michael McCarthy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54205f170e0a2617a2003204","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":186104,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Michael McCarthy","original_name":"John Michael McCarthy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54205f07c3a368799c002f9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1352361","wikidata_id":"Q5119822","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1146,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/20Pzd1UtMY0oSSYNlMNH3M5MyWI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":763}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Cigarette Girl Movie Trailer","key":"bZjrg2021Gg","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-02-16T16:03:58.000Z","id":"5f862a678258fc0037a31622"}]}}}
