No actual footage was shot for the project, which instead consists entirely of outtakes, commercials, strips of undeveloped film, Academy leader, and other filmic castoff material, creating a seemingly endless stream of newsreel and stock footage. It was the longest film ever made at the time of its release, but has since been superseded by many other films.\"","popularity":0.1156,"poster_path":"/p9CDhQDhpY7xRgRCyjtin6Hr740.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1968-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":2880,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Longest Most Meaningless Movie in the World","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1366113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vincent Patouillard","original_name":"Vincent Patouillard","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"541e63cb0e0a26124600a79f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2591224,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Scott","original_name":"Anthony Scott","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677dba1b89fc5d94424e54e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0342707","wikidata_id":"Q4407194","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":899,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aKYYaOT15aNxAWWLZhggJa4xrjr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1599}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/p9CDhQDhpY7xRgRCyjtin6Hr740.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1282},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f4rsLuhFdUTOuJegtngkSR5WWiW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1748,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bSEeV9FgoGveyXfGpTlaP6tfoc3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1181}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Art Lab Cinema","release_date":"1968-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
