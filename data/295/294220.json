Journeyman actor Eddie Dew stars as Revere, a Texas Ranger who goes undercover to smash an outlaw gang. Meanwhile, the villains install an informer amongst the Rangers, meaning that Revere will have to take care of this guy before he can complete his assignment. While Eddie Dew was OK in the lead, his thunder was stolen by the young actor cast as \"Trigger Dolan\"-future superstar Robert Mitchum. The plot was a bit too complicated for a film of this nature, thus future John Paul Revere installments were a bit easier to follow.","popularity":1.2819,"poster_path":"/iKntSzj0IQ8q3vNSCvctQ3fWntK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Thundering Thrills...As The Great Texas Rangers Take To The Adventure Trail..Hot On The Heels Of A Desperate Band Of Gun-Runners!","title":"Beyond the Last Frontier","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Dew","original_name":"Eddie Dew","popularity":0.1893,"profile_path":"/7NxwyQTp9lhEY5qkm1cjMf0EPmH.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Johnny Revere","credit_id":"54206603c3a3687985003206","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Smiley Burnette","original_name":"Smiley Burnette","popularity":0.2736,"profile_path":"/hfwpyujboZDjvsEqOEBxT5vJ9U5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Frog Millhouse","credit_id":"542066110e0a26179a0033da","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":226624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorraine Miller","original_name":"Lorraine Miller","popularity":0.1031,"profile_path":"/2nL6yy5buqlSmoLGcXeKMbw0v4M.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Susan Cook","credit_id":"54206624c3a368799c00314a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Mitchum","original_name":"Robert Mitchum","popularity":1.3089,"profile_path":"/l0It7MePd9cwgqHR3JQAYD6YMg9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Trigger Dolan","credit_id":"54206633c3a3687985003216","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Woods","original_name":"Harry Woods","popularity":0.1381,"profile_path":"/usSay3yVB6wxsLs3UA94b8CqdzC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Big Bill Hadley","credit_id":"54206640c3a3687985003219","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernie Adams","original_name":"Ernie Adams","popularity":0.138,"profile_path":"/zpKSSdsuDVofN1GAAbKnkn2GjrL.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"'Sarge' Kincaid","credit_id":"58a919799251417421000229","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Clarke","original_name":"Richard Clarke","popularity":0.1791,"profile_path":"/qd0vjbt5RrGOj1dwJHa5siPuvTs.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Steve Kincaid","credit_id":"58a919acc3a3680bd4000274","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Miller","original_name":"Charles Miller","popularity":0.1568,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Major Cook","credit_id":"58a919e792514173f600027f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kermit Maynard","original_name":"Kermit Maynard","popularity":0.3358,"profile_path":"/zwP78rIGvc3JKGuqhzZdodU9FfT.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Henchman Clyde Barton","credit_id":"58a919f492514173fa0002a5","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121049,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Morton Grant","original_name":"Morton Grant","popularity":0.1136,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54206576c3a368799c00311d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":120260,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John K.
