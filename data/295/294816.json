A man whose (hairy) hands are definitely full. Not only is he trying to stop his opponents from selling the US to China (by way of the controversial CHIMERICA Bill), but also solve a series of grizzly murders in the capitol. Add to this a crazed Mad Scientist, Smokey the Bear, a Miss Teen Beauty Pageant and a race against time to save his 8 year old son Bobby Wolfman from a murderous Vice President, and you have a movie that will keep you howling. Made entirely from recycled, stock & public domain footage with a newly scripted, scored & re-voiced soundtrack with enhanced visuals & post production. You've simply never seen anything like it before.","popularity":2.4612,"poster_path":"/yPhy3SPl76SA0Hty5JjzXdqw2Xz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"President Wolfman","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Evan Jackson","original_name":"Marc Evan Jackson","popularity":1.1319,"profile_path":"/4TWP0nlhkxkZ5XzzZuz3RCoZjFX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"President John Wolfman (voice)","credit_id":"6563d7857dfda659353b3bfa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3232550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Gari","original_name":"Amanda Gari","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/xwoHYP0SbZQ2qjACBUxbgNsw0ZM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6563d79d7dfda659304bf341","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dean Stockwell","original_name":"Dean Stockwell","popularity":1.2788,"profile_path":"/gdHo8LNElMf1XxoRYgi0UUzbJuB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"President John Wolfman (archive footage)","credit_id":"6769e84e4df531caf1a9de38","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":571335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Corey Smith","original_name":"Christopher Corey Smith","popularity":0.2249,"profile_path":"/zzDiDP7odJy9ntbCPTT6nBFgABr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Agent Tackler (voice)","credit_id":"6769e8ee45cc55ffb764a4f7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5138008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Ann","original_name":"Ashley Ann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bobby (voice)","credit_id":"6769e9014df531caf1a9de60","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1309670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Jenkins","original_name":"Anthony Jenkins","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"V.P.
