Safety engineer Peter Dahle increasingly sees a personal enemy in the construction of the power station and the mountain of Kaprun. To protect his workers, he asks the experienced mountain guide Hans Tribusser for help. For the glockner king, the massive intervention in nature is tantamount to blasphemy and he refuses his support. This brings Dahle's former love onto the scene. The wealthy Barbara Fuller is able to change the nature lover's mind, but her intrusion into the men's domain causes new disasters.","popularity":0.3022,"poster_path":"/w5BdrGwu9DNx6PFqjzD3S136XzH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bergland-Film
