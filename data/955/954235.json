Unlike Eve, she refused to obey her husband and considered herself equal to him. Lilith's Community is a virtual utopian sorority created through artistic revision of history on the basis of positive gender discrimination and rejection of the tradition of male domination. Lilith's Community is compiled out of eleven Ukrainian films of 1917-1930 by leaving only the episodes involving women. The editing was done not by creating artificial connections between the episodes, but by superimposing all source films according to the original chronology of episodes in each of them. Even with such hyperdensity, the film sometimes displays a black screen. It indicates that at this particular moment of the running time none of the eleven films featured a woman.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2S1s7qDrK1JoHkhLKEO196iaCw2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2015-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lilith's Community","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2762857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elias Parvulesco","original_name":"Elias Parvulesco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hTACO0BVONzPbmxnYpwtNleOjsL.jpg","credit_id":"623db4667cffda0047773ad2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2762857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elias Parvulesco","original_name":"Elias Parvulesco","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hTACO0BVONzPbmxnYpwtNleOjsL.jpg","credit_id":"623db45d945c20004a723c8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19047626","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2S1s7qDrK1JoHkhLKEO196iaCw2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Kyiv","release_date":"2015-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
