The resulting film is a moody trip into the world of The Fireworker, captured on the 25th October 2020. No fixes, no polishes, no light show, no nothing. Just the pure rendition of the music along with a surprise or two.  The original stream has now been completely re-edited and expanded with 30 minutes of additional material not included in the original broadcast, all remixed in 5.1 surround sound.  The Blu-Ray edition also contains 2.5 hours of bonus material including promo videos, interviews and a bonus concert filmed at the last night of the Soyuz Tour in 2019.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/5Fsod1jOWJLpkE0lYwt8WtAarw5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":230,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Gazpacho","title":"Gazpacho - Fireworking At St.Croix","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1311,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Fsod1jOWJLpkE0lYwt8WtAarw5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":874}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
