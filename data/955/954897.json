After the death of the mother, the child is adopted by Cherie, a local dancehall girl ostracized by the community. Cullum, a gambler who earlier seduced Mrs. McLeod, drifts into the town, and failing to win Cherie, he swears vengeance. McLeod, seeking the man who wrecked his home, falls in love with Cherie but scorns her when he discovers that she is a dancer. Ultimately, the child identifies Cullum as the gambler who lured Mrs. McLeod from her home. In the ensuing fight, Cullum is shot by a halfbreed, and Bruce is happily united with Cherie.","popularity":0.2674,"poster_path":"/b9lRbwQyeAfsUtnPH0K8wDZFXO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nine Points of the Law","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"A Girl's Decision","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Gibson","original_name":"Helen Gibson","popularity":0.1452,"profile_path":"/28xE4tpapbbEjpby7nv7IAWacSg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Cherie Du Bois","credit_id":"623faa3a4cbe120048a97c98","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Coxen","original_name":"Edward Coxen","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/msS2eq5NpafWYO4W78SQIiVYS7s.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bruce McLeod","credit_id":"623faa48d100b6005ca31c8e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo D.
