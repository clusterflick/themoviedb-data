On September 1, 2004, the four heroines of the film lost everything, and the world learned about the existence of the North Ossetian city of Beslan. In a few months, they will create a committee of the \"Mother of Beslan\" to fight for an honest investigation of the terrorist attack at school No. 1. At first, they did not allow the dilapidated school to be razed to the ground, then they knocked out money for the treatment and rehabilitation of hundreds of victims, blocked roads, clashed with the investigation — but none of them expected that this would drag on for many years, and hope for justice would melt much faster. Rodion Chepel's film \"The Committee\"- this is a private story of four women, which turns into a political thriller, a judicial drama, or a chronicle of merciless indifference. The heroines of this film have never been silent. We just didn't listen to them—or didn't want to hear them.","popularity":0.112,"poster_path":"/5qB7xpnpWB0JVs4xLBxYfc3pXe0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2014-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Committee","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2551653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodion Chepel","original_name":"Rodion Chepel","popularity":0.1543,"profile_path":"/zLqUdnvKVGyqdTAdbZ6Bnxk2ysC.jpg","credit_id":"623db02d7cffda0091660fb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2551732,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Rinat Khalekov","original_name":"Rinat Khalekov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623db0427cffda005c84742f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5qB7xpnpWB0JVs4xLBxYfc3pXe0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
