On his way home he stops at the station to tell Helen, the operator, of his good fortune. As Joe starts down the track towards home, Scarlotta, a member of a notorious vendetta that has marked Joe for death, shoots him from ambush. Helen sees Joe fall in the middle of the track and barely succeeds in dragging him to safety out of the path of the limited. Joe's wound is not serious and that night he takes his place as fireman on the freight. Determined to \"get\" Joe, Scarlotta visits the station where Helen is still at her key and after binding her and locking her in a closet, throws the switch so that the freight will collide with the cars on the siding.","popularity":0.1768,"poster_path":"/wtoKLMm4UvkwvcSwO3XWcs1gJuF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46167,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kalem Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fireman's Nemesis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Gibson","original_name":"Helen Gibson","popularity":0.1452,"profile_path":"/28xE4tpapbbEjpby7nv7IAWacSg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Helen, Operator at Lone Point","credit_id":"623f7ee4b4a54300488a9b83","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George A.
