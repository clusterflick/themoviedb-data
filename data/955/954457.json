Evolution is happening right now everywhere around us, and adaptive changes can occur in a population with remarkable speed. This is essential if you're a mouse living in an environment where a volcanic eruption can reverse selective pressure in nearly an instant. The film features Dr. Michael Nachman, whose work on pocket mice reveals a complete story, from ecosystem to molecules, that demonstrates how random changes in the genome can take many paths to the same adaptation-a colored coat that hides them from predators.","popularity":1.4495,"poster_path":"/ukxmqHMKfX4LtbVkPzcBGxoOgmY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172281,"logo_path":null,"name":"Howard Hughes Medical Institute","origin_country":""},{"id":161544,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pixeldust Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Making of the Fittest: Natural Selection and Adaptation","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1713686,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sean B.
