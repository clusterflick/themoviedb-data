He lives in the Irkutsk region. For twenty years, every winter Afanasyich goes to the taiga and spends three or four months there. He is a wolfman. His task is to catch wolves with the help of traps. So he protects not only deer and roe deer, but also domestic animals. In recent years, wolf packs have managed to eat whole herds of livestock over the winter. Afanasyich is a loner. He knows everything about wolves. And, it seems, the wolves already smell Afanasievich's approach. As soon as he appears in one of his taiga time zones, the wolves leave. \"In order to fight wolves, you have to be a little wolf yourself,\" Afanasich believes.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolfhound","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1686710,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergey Yastrzhembsky","original_name":"Sergey Yastrzhembsky","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":"/bYhYU3ejA3G4mDudw5qQc3ElELP.jpg","credit_id":"623dc6fc4fd141009614fb3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
