Beginning with how to get a great acoustic sound, Dave walks you through all the details of tuning your kit.  He then adds the mics, explaining the various types and their function and guides you in proper selection and placement.  Next he shows the missing console and covers frequencies, equalization, phase cancellation, and noise gates.
