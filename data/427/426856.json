Believing their politics and art to be absurdly different, De Antonio instead gamely proposed to drink an entire quart of J&amp;B scotch in 20 minutes under the unflinching, voyeuristic gaze of Warholâ€™s camera. Their Factory session, recorded in this film, instead lasted 66 minutes, its grand finale a reckless and grandiose De Antonio writhing on the floor, clawing the walls, and speaking in tongues.\" - MoMA","popularity":0.2006,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":41698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Andy Warhol Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drunk","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Drink","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emile de Antonio","original_name":"Emile de Antonio","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/jIlluWSIxVJ0A0kuxW7JWujcttU.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"58311a0dc3a3685bb001b0a2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Warhol","original_name":"Andy Warhol","popularity":0.2786,"profile_path":"/4FwsJKGOpYcYwFqxFKnbl5bFx3Y.jpg","credit_id":"58311a2ac3a3685b9d01d152","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0217403","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1965-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
