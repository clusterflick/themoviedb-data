Guitar Institute of Technology (GIT) instructor Ross Bolton has developed a clear, concise method that unravels the tricks and techniques at the heart of the unmistakable funk guitar sound. After laying down the fundamentals he moves on to cover the finer points: swing/straight 16th rhythm patterns, “hip-hop” grooves, classic funk chord voicings, single-note “bubble picking,” “skank” playing, and much more. You will learn to play both traditional and contemporary rhythm guitar parts in the styles of James Brown, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Prince, and many others. Split-screen closeups seamlessly dissolve into live performances to show how the techniques are applied. Never before has this essential style been so thoughtfully organized and presented. The entire presentation is well documented in a 17-page booklet, including full musical notation and tablature.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Funk Rhythm Guitar With Ross Bolton Part 1","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
