The music of Mozart has quite literally been an essential driving force of Daniel Barenboim’s entire life. It remains central to his performing career both as a pianist and as a conductor.  These illuminating performances of Mozart’s last eight great piano concertos admirably demonstrate Barenboim’s dictum that even when a true musician has already performed a familiar work hundreds of times, he or she ‘never accepts that the next note will be played the same way as it was played before.","popularity":0.1718,"poster_path":"/each4RovS72Atk2LDMwEn0lyey6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2255,"logo_path":null,"name":"EuroArts","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1989-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":255,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart Last 8 Piano Concertos (Daniel Barenboim)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Barenboim","original_name":"Daniel Barenboim","popularity":0.1008,"profile_path":"/pNoHzRlu3vNQmQsB7XrmrFYjOd1.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self - Pianist/Conductor","credit_id":"582bab5592514111bb000b13","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139431,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Moorse","original_name":"George Moorse","popularity":0.0986,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"582babacc3a36872c0000c51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Pierre Ponnelle","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Ponnelle","popularity":0.0506,"profile_path":"/mbYg4fxvHOYD9YmDuzPp3JVuBri.jpg","credit_id":"582babc7c3a36872c3000b32","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1139433,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaas Rusticus","original_name":"Klaas Rusticus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"582babe092514111ac000bba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"582bac32c3a36872bd000bb1","department":"Crew","job":"Compositors"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/each4RovS72Atk2LDMwEn0lyey6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1989-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
