Seventeen people live there. The old photographer Kempinski, shrouded in his memories. Hannelore, dreaming of distant lands, temporarily sharing her apartment with her lovesick niece. Bona, who occasionally drinks a beer with his roommate and teaches French in the kitchen. The two teenage sisters with their newly in love mom. The medieval caretaker couple and the young couple whose daughter Paula would rather sit in the stairwell than go to school. On the face of it, they all have nothing in common apart from their home address. The film tells in microscopically accurate, realistic visual language and on changing levels of the common everyday life of small people.","popularity":0.204,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1990-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Behind Locked Doors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3708,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Volkhart Buff","original_name":"Volkhart Buff","popularity":0.1292,"profile_path":"/42DIfmkfF40PAzVxoV8wj1w3x0l.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Victor","credit_id":"582c216b92514111ac005900","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1709449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonja Deutsch","original_name":"Sonja Deutsch","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Miss Stiller","credit_id":"582c2176c3a36872c60059e4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1512479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Fitzi","original_name":"Maria Fitzi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"582c218192514111ac00590f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1709450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susanne Fitzner","original_name":"Susanne Fitzner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Anita","credit_id":"582c218c92514111b700560f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2742409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helga Sloop","original_name":"Helga Sloop","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Hannelore","credit_id":"5f3700bf162bc300392872ca","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jockel Tschiersch","original_name":"Jockel Tschiersch","popularity":0.1422,"profile_path":"/nhfuwwQyB3u2q4MvyZPV2f0Ti1I.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Niklaus","credit_id":"5f3700d6111da100346b11d5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1505945,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anka Schmid","original_name":"Anka Schmid","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"582c213c92514111b4005bb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1505945,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anka Schmid","original_name":"Anka Schmid","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"582c214492514111b1005ca3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0102041","wikidata_id":"Q24763260","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
