Each day brings chance meetings and reluctant partings, joy and pain. The first vignette, \"Life\", portrays half of a woman's life in one-scene, one-cut, nine-minute sequence.  \"N\" is a comical take on a man abandoned by his lover.  \"Ya\" explores the bond of female friendship as one woman consoles a brokenhearted girlfriend. In \"Nowhere\", a man and a woman roam the streets of a foreign land in search of lost time.","popularity":0.9282,"poster_path":"/yRLTXdfV4TLjJaYVmal0fWejUt7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2003-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Is Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nene Otsuka","original_name":"大塚寧々","popularity":0.649,"profile_path":"/48TFOrOB7oZOJ0LXbYQb7p5PE1z.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"582a163f9251417b2603d900","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1253237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kentarō Kobayashi","original_name":"小林賢太郎","popularity":0.2525,"profile_path":"/u4Rf7QXzkGY9NNeUzKhafAKy7VK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"582a1657c3a3683601037436","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikako Ichikawa","original_name":"市川実日子","popularity":1.3041,"profile_path":"/9TZxvBENhVNBbmCrSPNilBomO5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"582a16719251417b2903ba77","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":555256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yorie Yamashita","original_name":"山下容莉枝","popularity":0.4432,"profile_path":"/wRTCnLWhpPJ4oYQbE8BfIFDp9fx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"582a168cc3a368623f01757c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haruko Katō","original_name":"加藤治子","popularity":0.4733,"profile_path":"/WyeP5PbPEDeQI83Mq1NYwB87mk.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5a156b2292514178b600ee87","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seiichi Tanabe","original_name":"田辺誠一","popularity":0.6037,"profile_path":"/fbIhQj2hkDHt94kqiWlp8pDu6Yl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"582a16c6c3a368623f01759b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoji Tanaka","original_name":"田中要次","popularity":0.823,"profile_path":"/752oL9YrUumjrqbhdj4GNJ938x3.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"582a16dec3a368360603e044","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seiichi Tanabe","original_name":"田辺誠一","popularity":0.6037,"profile_path":"/fbIhQj2hkDHt94kqiWlp8pDu6Yl.jpg","credit_id":"582a160cc3a3682358004c16","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seiichi Tanabe","original_name":"田辺誠一","popularity":0.6037,"profile_path":"/fbIhQj2hkDHt94kqiWlp8pDu6Yl.jpg","credit_id":"582a1601c3a368623f017540","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135383,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hideo Yamamoto","original_name":"山本英夫","popularity":0.1106,"profile_path":"/4x5jWPZgLMn1eNCiQVEZWltwWAa.jpg","credit_id":"5d2e0f93839d934d9eef7400","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seiichi Tanabe","original_name":"田辺誠一","popularity":0.6037,"profile_path":"/fbIhQj2hkDHt94kqiWlp8pDu6Yl.jpg","credit_id":"5d2e0fb66a300b0011a4e8e5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1198491,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yoshitaka Sakamoto","original_name":"阪本善尚","popularity":0.1192,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d2e0f826a300b5922a21c7c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1921912,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Naoki Ohtsubo","original_name":"Naoki Ohtsubo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fee917a4a4bf60040d4bead","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11382,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ryuichi Sakamoto","original_name":"坂本龍一","popularity":0.4488,"profile_path":"/nYMG17bYaFkyTzs37W80G0MofPd.jpg","credit_id":"5fee917060620a003d3ffeb1","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1020886","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yRLTXdfV4TLjJaYVmal0fWejUt7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":190200,"name":"short compilation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Life is Journey ライフ・イズ・ジャーニー 2003 -
