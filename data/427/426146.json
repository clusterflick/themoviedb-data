Completely unprepared Pål Hollender and his friend-with-a-death-wish, Swedish pop star Olle Ljungström, went to Afghanistan, wrecklessly diving into the tension building up in September 2002, the anniversary of 9/11 approaching. The result is a series of visually strong and intimate scenes from Afghanistan. The disturbing ignorance of the two friends from Sweden is as relevant as the meeting with the Afghan people and their culture.","popularity":0.0654,"poster_path":"/1yJd4nzhr4r3q9Da5kpG9m3clfz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"United States of Afghanistan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1243985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pål Hollender","original_name":"Pål Hollender","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":"/7oAvFpLeHcLjrlEZ0MSzDVQj7wK.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"582b304bc3a368235800d2bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1285974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olle Ljungström","original_name":"Olle Ljungström","popularity":0.1731,"profile_path":"/a0TktKzn31dqoJxvZGdoZpkrWZW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"582b30549251417b2904494a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1243985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pål Hollender","original_name":"Pål Hollender","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":"/7oAvFpLeHcLjrlEZ0MSzDVQj7wK.jpg","credit_id":"582b3064c3a368360803ea23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0454644","wikidata_id":"Q20496248","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1yJd4nzhr4r3q9Da5kpG9m3clfz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2pntTABf2OtRdeTOGsqu2eaDkpL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ab","note":"CPHDOX Festival","release_date":"2004-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ab","note":"TV premiere","release_date":"2005-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
