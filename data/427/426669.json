Creating new land, shaping ancient forests and carving tunnels through the earth, the volcano fascinates a dedicated group of scientists and filmmakers who follow its every action.  Ejecting fire, molten rock, giant boulders and poisonous gases, the volcano can be a hazard for researchers, homeowners, plants and animals, but it doesn't just leave destruction in its wake.  Twists and turns in the lava's flow leave some patches of original ecosystems, called kipukas, undisturbed.  These oases of life provide a haven to many rare creatures - including the Hawaiian state bird, the Nene - but remain in constant danger from the volcano and from invasive species.  At the end of its journey, the lava meets the ocean.  Braving an extremely hot sea, filmmakers record the birth of new land.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nature Kilauea Mountain of Fire","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
