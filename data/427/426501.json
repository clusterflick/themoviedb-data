It represents one side of a conversation between a young woman (sung by American soprano, Julia Migenes) and her lover, who has jilted her. In a 1930s, Parisian apartment, a woman is seen making for the door. As she passes the telephone, it rings. From now on she sings, sitting, standing, on her knees, pacing up and down the room, pulling at the telephone cord, going through every emotion until ultimately, in despair, she takes her own life.  Jean Cocteau wrote, it is not just that the telephone is sometimes more dangerous than the revolver but that its tangled cord drains us of our strength, while giving us nothing in return.","popularity":0.5196,"poster_path":"/dm5obn7I0IUa6kfDM7BUx4WfS7w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Human Voice","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":87268,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Migenes","original_name":"Julia Migenes","popularity":0.294,"profile_path":"/hHkrjXk4pkJgMVXwI3qGMBxK59d.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Une femme","credit_id":"59fe1dd19251414733023bd0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21377,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Medak","original_name":"Peter Medak","popularity":0.2613,"profile_path":"/oUPjJXMOSomwrqFx4eobxROVZOV.jpg","credit_id":"582e65929251410951010846","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9730,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Cocteau","original_name":"Jean Cocteau","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":"/vD73WSmN0hH3ZDjlh6n73CJI5sC.jpg","credit_id":"59fe1de292514146e80224a5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0256508","wikidata_id":"Q123741439","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.687,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dm5obn7I0IUa6kfDM7BUx4WfS7w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":515}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1990-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
