It is usually a reassuring and sometimes climactic element in a movie's storyline.  Not in Nicolas Provost's 'Gravity' though: with stroboscopic effects, more than a dozen kissing scenes, most from stereotypical 1950s romantic dramas, are edited together and superimposed. Narrative is subverted as the kissing is isolated from its context entirely; the action slows down and flickers back and forth. Every now and then, shots from different films overlap and match; protagonists merge and diverge again a few seconds later.  The sugary and dramatic soundtrack of romantic film music contrasts with the deconstructed images; together, they form a dazzling 6-minute vertigo where love becomes a passionate battle.","popularity":0.1797,"poster_path":"/rj9CMoZQVrbxYMTbdSBPzNepIvj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gravity","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Provost","original_name":"Nicolas Provost","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":"/c3nDpKUfl0wohIwbYG26zXWX33v.jpg","credit_id":"58320497c3a3685b93028dd7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930778,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Provost","original_name":"Nicolas Provost","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":"/c3nDpKUfl0wohIwbYG26zXWX33v.jpg","credit_id":"58bd740692514132a20021c7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3326076","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rj9CMoZQVrbxYMTbdSBPzNepIvj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
