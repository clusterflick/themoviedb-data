After miles in the blistering heat, it broke down in a remote village in Benin. There he encountered Mahounon, one of the most influential voodoo priests of West Africa. Abandoning his planned trip, Venzago set out instead on an odyssey through the world of African voodoo, to which he and his camera gained extraordinary access.  Venzago followed Mahounon with his camera for nearly ten years, filming secret Voodoo ceremonies and sacrificial rituals. He witnessed Mahounon’s extraordinary search for a successor to lead the cult, and he watched as the anointed eleven-year old boy, Gounon, was schooled in black and white magic, rituals, and the intricate workings of the Fa, or Voodoo oracle.  Venzago’s camera evokes the religious ecstasy of these ceremonies as well as their otherworldly atmosphere. His photographs illuminate this mysterious and potent Voodoo culture and religion.","popularity":0.0947,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8465,"logo_path":null,"name":"Traumwerk Filmproduktion GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2003-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mounted By The Gods","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Luc Julien","original_name":"Jean-Luc Julien","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":"/uXkqX3AIlATuLIgiAHG57cGferZ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"The Outsider (voice)","credit_id":"582b554a9251417b29046035","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Venzago","original_name":"Alberto Venzago","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"582b55589251417b2304424b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0270522","wikidata_id":"Q91855137","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
