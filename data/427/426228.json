Battlewounded and struggling with survivor's guilt, Sam now resents the complacency of his former comrades and derides what he sees as the younger generation's indifference to the politics of sex, and of death. An unexpected intimacy with a much younger man challenges Sam's understanding of contemporary gay life. Through this unconventional romance, he is forced to deal with the trauma that so informs his past, their present, and an unknown future.","popularity":1.5774,"poster_path":"/2MBJUVjZ8w8c6GPW0E1BmI52wx2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101062,"logo_path":null,"name":"Freestyle Digital
