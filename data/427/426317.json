He gets hungry for smoked salmon, nostalgic for his childhood and decides to spend a summer smoking fish at his family's traditional fish camp. The unusual story of his life and the untold history of his people interweave with the process of preparing traditional food as he struggles to pay his bills, keep the IRS off his back, and keep his business afloat. By turns tragic, bizarre, or just plain ridiculous, Smokin' Fish tells the story of one man's attempt to navigate the messy zone of collision between the modern world and an ancient culture.","popularity":0.053,"poster_path":"/fo6HQQiEz6lli6h3133Yx5vyONb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smokin' Fish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1709672,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cory Mann","original_name":"Cory Mann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"582c8b3cc3a3682452000640","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally and Valentino Burattin","original_name":"Sally and Valentino Burattin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Selves","credit_id":"6356d4afc8a2d4008a00ac95","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Abbott","original_name":"Helen Abbott","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6356d4c1d18fb9007ab3f65c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3545576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Mann","original_name":"Mike Mann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6356d50defd3c200794d39f3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jordan Lee Curbow","original_name":"Jordan Lee Curbow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6356d52c5f4b73008d57c5f0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756097,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Tapp-Yadda Hon","original_name":"Jonathan Tapp-Yadda Hon","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6356d543f8e982007c5dd20a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1709673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luke Griswold-Tergis","original_name":"Luke Griswold-Tergis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6356d560c8a2d4007a4fdfc8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Hotch","original_name":"Joe Hotch","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6356d57843250f007d0526d6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diane Alejandra Lopez Ramirez","original_name":"Diane Alejandra Lopez Ramirez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6356d59a43cd54008267d0ee","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marge Jackson","original_name":"Marge Jackson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6356d5b2d399e6007d23a6b6","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3756104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhonda J.
