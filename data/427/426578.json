He does it for them. But this is home, too. Like the hundreds of Christmas tree sellers who descend upon the city from Canada, New England and even Europe, Francois delivers the magic of the season over a grueling month in his adopted neighborhood. He's a star, a storyteller, a Santa Claus in a sap-stained coat, a confidant, a friend, and a father figure to the local characters who are his New York family. They also need him. TREE MAN is the story of Francois's journey, how he arrived here, what holds him, and the conflict that will cause him to leave. As one of Francois' long-time customers says: \"This has nothing to do with the trees anymore.\"","popularity":0.2859,"poster_path":"/wQ6x7cPe890uZGVr2GfVT8Hj1P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85133,"logo_path":null,"name":"166 Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tree Man","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1819517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francois","original_name":"Francois","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"tree man","credit_id":"591eaf6f925141482f02f499","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732844,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jon Reiner","original_name":"Jon Reiner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586da47ac3a3683b64000b16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732845,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brad Rothschild","original_name":"Brad Rothschild","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586da4899251412963000abe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406904,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Scott Cook","original_name":"John Scott Cook","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586da4b0c3a3683b780009e9","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732844,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jon Reiner","original_name":"Jon Reiner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586da4e9c3a3683b64000b55","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732844,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jon Reiner","original_name":"Jon Reiner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586da4f3c3a3683b85000a96","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732845,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brad Rothschild","original_name":"Brad Rothschild","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586da502c3a3683b7e000b7c","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732845,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brad Rothschild","original_name":"Brad Rothschild","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586da50d925141295f000b94","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1316446,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jennifer Davidoff Cook","original_name":"Jennifer Davidoff Cook","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586da536c3a3683b71000b2c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406904,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Scott Cook","original_name":"John Scott Cook","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"586da549c3a3683b7e000b9d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1077579,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"David W.
