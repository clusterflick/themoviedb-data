In the immediate confusion that followed no one knew what had happened. Within hours two men would manage a heroic escape but 29 remained unaccounted for. Over five days the men’s families and loved ones waited, hoping they would come out alive. Then two further explosions sealed the men’s fate.  However, the fuse that would eventually snuff out so many lives was lit decades before. Set in the drama of the five days between the three explosions, Pike River reveals the tragic back story of the mine where pressure for profits would eventually contribute to the deaths of 29 men. Featuring interviews with the Pike River families and scripted drama to depict key events.","popularity":0.8244,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":62699,"logo_path":"/yp9cBOaV852zfKichaBQ4ev831I.png","name":"Screentime","origin_country":"NZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New
