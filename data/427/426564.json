Wood Jr., and a mundane scientific documentary. The premise is that five individuals from one community, Eagle Valley, are abducted by aliens who then put them on trail for environmental crimes as typical representatives of the human race. Environment was primarily shown in high schools to stimulate discussion on the balance of nature, pollution, and human consumption.","popularity":0.3704,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Environment","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Trial of Earth","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56444,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Cornthwaite","original_name":"Robert Cornthwaite","popularity":0.3601,"profile_path":"/rvMy2QFjwdZAKOXzJWbw15wlRMT.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"582f05b39251413e7f00a487","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1710542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John A.
