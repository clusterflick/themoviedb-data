At a secret meeting in Paris they discuss what to do with the former Auschwitz commandant Karl Brochmann, who since 12 years lives in London under the false identity of Karl Luther. They decide to take the law in their own hands, and send their member David to London. He starts his commission by scaring Luther, to see his reactions. Luther is already nervous, because the newspapers are writing about the capture of Eichmann. When he finds out that somebody has broken into his apartment and painted a swastika on his mirror, he gets terrified. He empties his bank account, packs a bag with all his cash and runs away, followed by David.","popularity":1.1557,"poster_path":"/8wXqudzevM7osZGrzwEE9ADr2Dp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5078,"logo_path":null,"name":"Danziger Productions Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1961-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pursuers","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cyril Shaps","original_name":"Cyril Shaps","popularity":0.3542,"profile_path":"/rNfjiJV77Vf2PsctHFlL3mUOZDz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Luther","credit_id":"5cdf0ccc0e0a265058cc11d4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Matthews","original_name":"Francis Matthews","popularity":0.287,"profile_path":"/7Zuiry4LXzPeKDCLTQs029LpnvX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"David","credit_id":"5cdf0cf8c3a3685e74c169c4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2245095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Denny","original_name":"Susan Denny","popularity":0.0657,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jenny","credit_id":"5cdf0d24c3a3685e74c16a00","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Murcell","original_name":"George Murcell","popularity":0.1818,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Freddy","credit_id":"5cdf0d98925141457bcecbf0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1063304,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheldon Lawrence","original_name":"Sheldon Lawrence","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Rico","credit_id":"5cdf0ddfc3a36846bcc169e6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertan Klauber","original_name":"Gertan Klauber","popularity":0.1864,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bernstein","credit_id":"5dad8772ae366800179a853b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Marner","original_name":"Richard Marner","popularity":0.4994,"profile_path":"/r9g2sRTyYztWcG3UmFTJEcuVbXI.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Aranson","credit_id":"5dad8782435011001547cc59","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gabriel","original_name":"John Gabriel","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Wally","credit_id":"5dfbd5b2d1a89300128324e3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Doonan","original_name":"Tony Doonan","popularity":0.095,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Wilmo","credit_id":"5dfbd5c1d1a89300148365d5","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Plytas","original_name":"Steve Plytas","popularity":0.2596,"profile_path":"/qFGSjfiC6qBEMCdpvZgI4YIUvE4.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Petersen","credit_id":"5dfbd5dcd1a8930012832517","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1071269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andre Mikhelson","original_name":"Andre Mikhelson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Von Krosig","credit_id":"5dfbd5f765686e00188eb79a","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1973072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexis Chesnakov","original_name":"Alexis Chesnakov","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Lunde","credit_id":"5dfbd6075ed9620016e55658","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1218554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reginald Marsh","original_name":"Reginald Marsh","popularity":0.2265,"profile_path":"/q2c8qe3gkGQ8PtxJL17H2yalV8W.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Inspector","credit_id":"5dfbd61960975000123588fd","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Godfrey Grayson","original_name":"Godfrey Grayson","popularity":0.3281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5832170ec3a3685bb002a53c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26128,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brian Clemens","original_name":"Brian Clemens","popularity":0.2335,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cdf0e3ac3a368606fc00363","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":109845,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Walter J.
