A passion they share and pushed them to become professionals. They travel around the world in search of walls and cliffs of exception. In Spring 2014 they set up camp beneath one of the most difficult multi-pitch routes in the world – Orbayu (2000 meters). Orbayu is a large limestone tooth which rises above the natural park of Picos de Europa in Spain. This huge wall is among the most beautiful in the world. It’s a mixture of extreme difficulty (8c). But the major problem with this type of wall lies in the fact that weather changes are very fast: rain, low temperatures, wind, etc… The ascent of such walls demand unusual experience. Nina and Cédric document joy, fear, danger, but also the beauty of climbing in Orbayu.","popularity":0.465,"poster_path":"/xGwe777MrBpFexIINzE3AhX5xWL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207392,"logo_path":"/baBJ0oSM1ViNkmwKnEGbNPJPDOi.png","name":"L'Illustroscope","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orbayu","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1574742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cédric Lachat","original_name":"Cédric Lachat","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/tcKe5wLop9HAVi91ps3qcHDPlBO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Cédric Lachat","credit_id":"5829e7b19251417b1803a8c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1306500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nina Caprez","original_name":"Nina Caprez","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":"/rz28uOk8rLt1NrrXtzlBx2t2rYu.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Nina Caprez","credit_id":"5829e7a69251417b23038b98","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3664135,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mathieu Rivoire","original_name":"Mathieu Rivoire","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64eead303a99370139290f10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1574749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Nadiras","original_name":"Julien Nadiras","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64eeaeb1e0ca7f012eb18e8f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lTXwkI5HEQzcX3L5r0Utb5mXfmD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xGwe777MrBpFexIINzE3AhX5xWL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":514,"name":"spain"},{"id":201008,"name":"rock climbing"},{"id":230587,"name":"picos de europa"},{"id":272233,"name":"escalade"},{"id":316788,"name":"freeclimbing"},{"id":322235,"name":"rockclimbing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ab","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"ORBAYU [full movie] a climbing Odyssey with Nina Caprez and Cédric Lachat","key":"J7QeAx8mn9A","published_at":"2016-12-12T10:53:12.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5850f4009251416fa10130c5"}]}}}
