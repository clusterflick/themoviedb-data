Are the clouds above them simply witnessing the process or do they actually take part in it?  Shot on Super 8 with its characteristic unexpected light leaks, Passing Clouds explores a different possibility to the birth of clouds. Throughout the film, the sheep, the shepherd and his dogs guide us towards understanding the mystery of this mythical cycle based on what happens once a fleece is no longer attached to a sheep's body.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/xZBDcxfwfNOyznyL3yFOhwLip4C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A free interpretation on the reliance between those who occupy the land and its interweaving with the sky","title":"Passing Clouds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5425592,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannah Brown","original_name":"Hannah Brown","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681cd6538fd3cdb1cdc1dc8c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3941261,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Javier Irazuzta","original_name":"Javier Irazuzta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681cd65c565afadcad01eb17","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3941261,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Javier Irazuzta","original_name":"Javier Irazuzta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681cd66847edf30f573ec946","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5425592,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannah Brown","original_name":"Hannah Brown","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681cd67b34ddf20fe601ea6d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ryxrFSOwlsVU4KaqnIRklrTC9Tb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xZBDcxfwfNOyznyL3yFOhwLip4C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4932,"name":"farm"},{"id":5888,"name":"agriculture"},{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":294531,"name":"documentary film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
