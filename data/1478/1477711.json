He lives in his wooden yurt on a 6-acre woodland in Devon and has spent over 20 years preserving the land and living self-sufficiently. Now in his older years, as he witnesses the climate crisis, he wishes to share his lifetime of knowledge in the hope of inspiring younger generations to reconnect with the land. Marcus’ hopeful wisdom believes what ancestral people taught; “that what you did in your lifetime wasn’t for you, it was for the next seven generations… So you made sure you left Mother Nature in the same condition for them.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/r8yocFe42FfqlyovXSV3yxaUtWk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53197,"logo_path":null,"name":"Manto Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Folk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5425512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcus Tribe","original_name":"Marcus Tribe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"681ccdc3148c81dde20b29ef","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5425503,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Clark","original_name":"Laura Clark","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681ccd3820f0a9bdcd0b2e72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5425506,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Bloomfield","original_name":"George Bloomfield","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681ccd46dd70cac4d788c3c1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iaADU5TQkOZCx2q1T1JKX82zcwS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r8yocFe42FfqlyovXSV3yxaUtWk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":294531,"name":"documentary film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Wild Folk | Short Film","key":"xy61z0Ghqdc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2024-03-15T17:00:07.000Z","id":"681ccdf9126f7d14b86e3814"}]}}}
