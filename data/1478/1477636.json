Hugely popular, he presided over enormous growth, but corruption raged under his tenure, as did electoral manipulation and often violent suppression of dissent.  This film tells Joh’s story through rare archival footage and revelatory interviews, exploring a life shaped by a hard yakka, god-fearing upbringing on his family’s farm. Trump’s spectre is evoked in Joh’s famously mangled and meandering way of speaking – brilliantly dramatised by Richard Roxburgh – alongside his unyielding execution of power and the desperate denial of his final days in office.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"A captivating and cautionary portrait of one of Australia’s most controversial politicians, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, whose career can be seen as a playbook for the Trump era.","title":"Joh: Last King Of Queensland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5425117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joh Bjelke-Petersen","original_name":"Joh Bjelke-Petersen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"681caba596e6b5489388c27f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kriv Stenders","original_name":"Kriv Stenders","popularity":0.7853,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681cab688783b3db17c1dc43","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kriv Stenders","original_name":"Kriv Stenders","popularity":0.7853,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681cac59d5b89308c26e38bf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5425124,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matthew Condon","original_name":"Matthew Condon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681cac6ef67ff6f87288c2e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1367735,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karryn de Cinque","original_name":"Karryn de Cinque","popularity":0.1356,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681caca6565afadcad01e9d9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":990549,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Veronica Fury","original_name":"Veronica Fury","popularity":0.5337,"profile_path":"/dZT25HDvG26etiC1D4AIdVMpkDs.jpg","credit_id":"681cacd88fd3cdb1cdc1db87","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1651877,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alan Erson","original_name":"Alan Erson","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681cad209b9ffe34a893ae3a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36846173","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":252097,"name":"australian politics"},{"id":256946,"name":"queensland, australia"},{"id":351628,"name":"polotics"},{"id":351629,"name":"joh bjelke-petersen"},{"id":351630,"name":"queensland"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sydney Film Festival","release_date":"2025-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
