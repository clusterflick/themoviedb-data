This area has a rich history of activism, with past protests here credited for helping launch the UKâ€™s conservation movement and the Right to Roam. After clearing away the reeds and rubbish they created a thriving aquatic ecosystem where frogs and newts now breed. This film is part of Common Ground, a multimedia documentary project exploring the ecology of Wanstead Flats and the people who use it.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6rLDwtXYuhAcAgVCIPMuLV7a8Bh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Common Ground: Cat and Dog Pond","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5423810,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Croft","original_name":"Nick Croft","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"681bd7e83aae9a957463b533","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5423811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Thomas","original_name":"Mark Thomas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"681bd7f6eadf6f16e76e345b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5423791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annick Wolfers","original_name":"Annick Wolfers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681bd72a24375906403ec4ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5423791,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annick Wolfers","original_name":"Annick Wolfers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681bd73eb1f90a9d1663b501","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h02V41SfGfsbDjiKHqKfocx0EI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6rLDwtXYuhAcAgVCIPMuLV7a8Bh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":294531,"name":"documentary film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"NICK & MARK / CAT & DOG","key":"841401912","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-07-01T02:12:24.000Z","id":"681bd7a820f0a9bdcd0b25bd"}]}}}
