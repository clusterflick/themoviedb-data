The shop was a labor of love, service, and sacrifice throughout the decades for Joy. Ally always saw Joy’s sacrifices for the shop as a burden on Joy’s life and happiness. When Ally returns to the shop to prepare it for sale, she meets Bennett, an old soul, who wants to preserve her Grandma Joy’s legacy. As Ally and Bennett navigate the next steps, divine intervention forces them both to take a new, or rather old look at the fate of the shop and themselves.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":182197,"logo_path":"/oG5cuyTyU4QPpcrD5Zr1JfkwUwA.png","name":"Candy Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":180934,"logo_path":"/dTBkfIQZvImcftJvp5ckAYog6w6.png","name":"Great American Media","origin_country":"US"},{"id":198113,"logo_path":"/yBRwEqqy6cQxkjfM335uFRcSx20.png","name":"Syrup Studios","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":2090,"logo_path":"/jYlUttNqcN5u1pzMQrh5AEhZ27t.png","name":"Motion Picture Corporation of America","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6345,"logo_path":"/pctomojbRLZNdYB0muFoZiaYdPI.png","name":"Lighthouse Pictures","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Timeless Tidings of Joy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Candace Cameron Bure","original_name":"Candace Cameron Bure","popularity":2.2456,"profile_path":"/sDNFyYgyVmE5AGFCeLR0DVDzCji.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ally","credit_id":"681c765620f0a9bdcd0b2cb3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Greene","original_name":"Paul Greene","popularity":1.8374,"profile_path":"/irVtc0p4aL545YbfmXtdgBZ5ebs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bennett","credit_id":"681c7677126f7d14b86e36c9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1912418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natasha Bure","original_name":"Natasha Bure","popularity":0.5865,"profile_path":"/mRrvBoZYwQ1ydlFIyfmMdUNvIp3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Joy","credit_id":"681c7661921c4734f90b27fa","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Candace Cameron Bure","original_name":"Candace Cameron Bure","popularity":2.2456,"profile_path":"/sDNFyYgyVmE5AGFCeLR0DVDzCji.jpg","credit_id":"681c76a2f12ffbb1c163b7e0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1108735,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rob Lycar","original_name":"Rob Lycar","popularity":0.52,"profile_path":"/eO8CTvICy2F0NH6v2RQTeD6ZxEd.jpg","credit_id":"681c76dc3a275d64d10b2814","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1632115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paula Elle","original_name":"Paula Elle","popularity":0.7737,"profile_path":"/qmIRvO67FAcgtX5F5y8nCnCdtLS.jpg","credit_id":"681c76e886da17923b0b28f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1560333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masey McLain","original_name":"Masey McLain","popularity":0.7759,"profile_path":"/iKWUkrVXZlDsIdD4skJO65KjNOQ.jpg","credit_id":"681c76f07f23dade930b2884","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1661265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Kalupa","original_name":"Taylor Kalupa","popularity":0.6988,"profile_path":"/jGvR7CxN9BlOzdfBZ77WoKCm6uB.jpg","credit_id":"681c76f777b2a1404188c1bd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1711080,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Holly A.
