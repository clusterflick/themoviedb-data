uniquely stripped-back performances of tracks including “Warrior” and “Murder Song (5, 4, 3, 2, 1).” Whether she’s reminiscing on her childhood with her sisters, dancing through the city streets in her headphones, or discussing the secret life of apples, there’s a spellbinding quality to everything the artist does.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ddPdBC7HPZnfQeliaH8TgCcqmDL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81609,"logo_path":null,"name":"The
