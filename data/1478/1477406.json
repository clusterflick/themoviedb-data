Meet Terry Masear, a retired UCLA professor who rescues the hummingbirds that descend on Los Angeles every spring in a seasonal frenzy of breeding. Wounded hummingbirds find their way to Masear as her mobile hotline rings off the hook from callers who find them and require her expertise. Among Masear’s diminutive patients are Cactus, Jimmy, Wasabi, Alexa, and Mikhail, whose lives are brought into sharp focus through breathtaking, beautifully detailed photography. The compassion and empathy that Masear shows her Lilliputian charges serves as a lesson to us all — the delicate beauty in profound acts of kindness.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/r619Pggj8stc9Ps51Q20KUZ8g2t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":19636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thirteen Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":8191,"logo_path":"/bXYH4HA4GqN5mAIn2pRdlqnDRyI.png","name":"Dogwoof","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":75207,"logo_path":"/5HMd3ADYzBGuvLFuRycSIWDpJFf.png","name":"WildBear Entertainment","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":83714,"logo_path":"/v8EoMrSFyvXtChtJXHn2tobgrmL.png","name":"Tangled Bank Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":158800,"logo_path":"/pGWvq9K7JpBSdXlpurfA6FsGlOh.png","name":"The WNET Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hummingbirds of Hollywood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1244073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sally Aitken","original_name":"Sally Aitken","popularity":0.4958,"profile_path":"/2GlQoCAixuvUOyiFal8jnHvC735.jpg","credit_id":"681bfc7acc93bba0506e3476","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1621,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r619Pggj8stc9Ps51Q20KUZ8g2t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1081}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS","release_date":"2025-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
