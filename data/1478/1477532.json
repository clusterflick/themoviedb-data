Dutch diva Ellen Vogel is stunning in her feature debut, in spite of the mediocre image quality. We're showingt a digitalisation of a version that underwent analogue conservation in 1983. It's not a restoration, so the image quality is average.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/q0svGHhwnIISwwbVpo4MFLXDrhX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Occupied Territory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":79447,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Vogel","original_name":"Ellen Vogel","popularity":0.2726,"profile_path":"/fauZEw2zk0KAoXjdXI5fZeLnjZG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"681c73a09d339c79c693ad2e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5424673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Beyer","original_name":"Mary Beyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"681c73b08783b3db17c1db5f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Bergmann","original_name":"Tim Bergmann","popularity":0.6312,"profile_path":"/fiG7mlE61ySNaPxV3W5XlfhbvBN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"681c73bea62c4f98146e367c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5424676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cor Borgman","original_name":"Cor Borgman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"681c73d164b851065bc1dabc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5424678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ludzer Eringa","original_name":"Ludzer Eringa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"681c73dc96e6b5489388c1b1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5424679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Goedhart","original_name":"Bob Goedhart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"681c73ea8bdcdb489d63b734","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5424681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Hafkamp","original_name":"Peter Hafkamp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"681c73f6fdbb19e54dc1daba","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5424682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Huyer","original_name":"Fred Huyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"681c73fe9404fd1ab593ace4","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2995428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frans Dupont","original_name":"Frans Dupont","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681c741e3d6405c06988c168","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q0svGHhwnIISwwbVpo4MFLXDrhX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
