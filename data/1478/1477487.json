Pictorializing the growths and formations of earthly \"bodies\" (land, life, technology, language) using humanity's most elemental symbols of communication. A voice, satellite-like in its disembodiment, articulates its stream of consciousness or lack thereof; its monologue meanders and overlaps, leaving viewers space to interpret the visual material of the colorful runic terrain.
