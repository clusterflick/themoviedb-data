Borrowing from films, The Killer and The Zone of Interest, the film drifts between presence and absence, coherence and rupture. Sounds warp, images flicker, and meaning slips through the cracks—less about what is told than how it reverberates. Here, perception is unsettled, and the gaze is no longer passive. You are not just watching—you are being drawn in, mirrored, and implicated.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cnTzFw4mCMLoXPDNlNDOQA971WQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What if the screen is watching you back?","title":"The Camera's Gaze","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4874039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abtin Azghandi","original_name":"Abtin Azghandi","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/vUcMbIJHa0BauV8uUpEnPO0F7OW.jpg","credit_id":"681ce898126f7d14b86e38a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4874039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abtin Azghandi","original_name":"Abtin Azghandi","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/vUcMbIJHa0BauV8uUpEnPO0F7OW.jpg","credit_id":"681ce8aaa3d0a47d2301ea49","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4874039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abtin Azghandi","original_name":"Abtin Azghandi","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/vUcMbIJHa0BauV8uUpEnPO0F7OW.jpg","credit_id":"681ce8c7ef37203a97b1cbf1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4874039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abtin Azghandi","original_name":"Abtin Azghandi","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/vUcMbIJHa0BauV8uUpEnPO0F7OW.jpg","credit_id":"681ce8df03dc6fecb493b019","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3584100,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mani Jahannama","original_name":"Mani Jahannama","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681ce9028f3c3850613ec9ae","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mix Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4874039,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abtin Azghandi","original_name":"Abtin Azghandi","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/vUcMbIJHa0BauV8uUpEnPO0F7OW.jpg","credit_id":"681d4cee6f91c0c8ff3ecabf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eviSqcbgjk0NDEVDG0A1BTPS2ln.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cnTzFw4mCMLoXPDNlNDOQA971WQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
