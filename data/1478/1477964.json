The Sete Quedas (Seven Falls) were the largest waterfalls in the world by water volume. In 1982, the violent flooding of the falls and the lands of traditional communities in the region was completed to create the reservoir of the Itaipu Hydroelectric Plant. In this short film, filmmaker Frederico Füllgraf captures the final days of this natural wonder of Paraná, accompanied by verses from Carlos Drummond de Andrade (written in reference to the waterfalls’ destruction) and the Avá-Guarani Quarup ritual.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/8cqpAkaxJ8GuTmGA1Wcx6OCmFDZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quarup Sete Quedas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5426476,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frederico Fullgraf","original_name":"Frederico Fullgraf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681d3f0a853bc5cfe088c509","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/8cqpAkaxJ8GuTmGA1Wcx6OCmFDZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
