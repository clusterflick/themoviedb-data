One particular set of graffiti catches her attention. Found in the back stairwell in Pearl Centre, Chinatown, the anonymous drawer roughly sketches a man and a woman beside a series of three numbers. Several of these same scribbles are found in different parts of the stairwell.  What does it mean? What is the writer trying to communicate? Debbie, like a detective tries to decipher the meaning of these scribbles and she talks also of graffiti in general. Are these acts of vandals or are they notes from people seeking to communicate with others? Or are they acts of memorialisation by the writers themselves? Perhaps it is all three. Recently, Debbie excitedly reports, in the Bugis area near NLB, the same scribble. Has the Yangtze Scribbler moved?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/s6AFGauMQYMVcSpqxQuT22pDCcZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yangtze Scribbler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1322394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tan Pin Pin","original_name":"Tan Pin Pin","popularity":0.1776,"profile_path":"/a4Fo2ccwMyo53Hf8e8aJodK5Dj2.jpg","credit_id":"681b2890c4bf30434ec6994b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5422233,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Josephine Seetoh","original_name":"Josephine Seetoh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681b28adb0aa4158bc8509a5","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5422234,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gek Lisan","original_name":"Gek Lisan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681b28c8b0aa4158bc8509a8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5422380,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"David Shiyang Liu","original_name":"David Shiyang Liu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681b29337e07434d6def0ce0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2934552,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bani Haykal","original_name":"Bani Haykal","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681b294e53c431f7d3ef0c68","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1335,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s6AFGauMQYMVcSpqxQuT22pDCcZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":890}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
