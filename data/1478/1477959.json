Close-ups of Harper’s creased and scarred skin highlight how time is etched onto the body. The suggestion that memory is both a mental and physical imprint is further emphasized by the appearance of emotive passages from Robert Glück’s book About Ed (2023), which recounts his partnership and friendship with the artist Ed Aulerich-Sugai during Ed’s physical decline and death from AIDS-related illness.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3377987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meg Harper","original_name":"Meg Harper","popularity":0.102,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"681d39e0fe46eb7e54b1cb3f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5426501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kang Seung Lee","original_name":"Kang Seung Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"681d396fef0bced74701ea8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
