On Saturday morning at roughly 10 o’clock, with beautiful weather and calm seas, a Frenchman sat in a beach chair to gaze upon the magnificent view that the sea always affords, until he slowly began to fall asleep’ So begins a report in the ‘Zandvoortsche Courant’ of July 25, 1905. The article explains how the man was faced with the oncoming tide, and – to the amazement of the audience – took off his trousers to prevent them from being ruined by the saltwater. While trying to escape from the policeman who had rushed to the scene, he jumps into a passing car, and hides out in a small changing cabin. Eventually he's nabbed by the police. Accompanied by a band and a large crowd, he is escorted to the police station. The article ends by saying that ‘Messrs. Alberts Frères’ had staged the whole incident for a film in which two of the most popular genres of that period - the locally-shot film and the chase film – would be combined.","popularity":0.1549,"poster_path":"/xZESyXdv9O2dQe3dxc9N7SouR8j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59786,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alberts Frères","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1905-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Misadventure of a French Gentleman Without Pants at the Zandvoort Beach","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les aventures d'un Français sur la plage de Zandvoort","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Ongeval van een Fransch heertje zonder pantalon uit Zandvoort","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Misadventure of a French Gentleman Without Pants at the Zandvoort Beach","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Misadventure of a French Dandy Without Trousers on the Beach at Zandvoort","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willy Mullens","original_name":"Willy Mullens","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/edeBhe7S05zOvNSwbGu3rJroEb6.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"meneer Van Dommelen","credit_id":"634fde945f4b73008d554b11","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willy Mullens","original_name":"Willy Mullens","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/edeBhe7S05zOvNSwbGu3rJroEb6.jpg","credit_id":"55bb94d0c3a368653900002c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Mullens","original_name":"Albert Mullens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55bb94c59251413e5b000023","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Mullens","original_name":"Albert Mullens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634fe913880c92009009e3a3","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1492185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert Mullens","original_name":"Albert Mullens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634fe8dabe4b360084e488cc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willy Mullens","original_name":"Willy Mullens","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/edeBhe7S05zOvNSwbGu3rJroEb6.jpg","credit_id":"634fe8d1a0f1a2007cdca85a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1112865","wikidata_id":"Q1899476","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xZESyXdv9O2dQe3dxc9N7SouR8j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3713,"name":"chase"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1905-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Misadventure of a French Gentleman Without Pants at the Zandvoort Beach (A.&W.
