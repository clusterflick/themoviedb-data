A musically conceived piece, referencing the video operas of Robert Ashley, the film explores the social imaginary of a utopian landscape through directed attention to the voices that inhabit it.Treating the medium of film as both a musical proposition and a proposal for collective production, A Necessary Music employs the resident of New York’s Roosevelt Island as its authors and actors, gathering together texts written by them and using them to construct a script for the film. Framed by a fictional narration taken from Adolfo Bioy Casares’ 1941 science fiction novel ‘The invention of Morel’, the film self-consciously dissolves from attempted realism to imagined narrative; what begins as a enthnographic study becomes instead an imagined fiction and an investigation into the mechanics of representation itself.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Necessary Music","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beatrice Gibson","original_name":"Beatrice Gibson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4afd9251416c910cc419","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4146918","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
