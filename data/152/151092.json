Now all she wants is to return home to her daughter, 15-year-old Samantha. But when a powerful solar flare strikes her flight home, killing the pilot, knocking out the co-pilot and frying all the electronic systems on the plane, it looks like she may not get there. As panic sets in among the passengers, Kate works with flight attendant Jake to manage the growing chaos and tension on the plane as she tries to keep 30,000 tons of steel hurtling through the air at 500 miles per hour. Flying blind, Kate tries to find a way to communicate with air traffic control - one way or another, this plane is coming down. With the passengers' lives on the line, Kate will have to find a way to land safely... or never see her daughter again.","popularity":1.4381,"poster_path":"/6YGo4vk9tcUxbec7kPi9CPDOVtP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6679,"logo_path":"/r3r7qbHKgo8N0yr7r1TjLmzLXfQ.png","name":"MarVista Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One way or another, this plane is coming down.","title":"Collision Course","video":false,"vote_average":4.346,"vote_count":39,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Kollisionskurs","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Blackout im Cockpit","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Solar Flight","type":"working title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Collision Course","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Todesflug 415","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Catastrophe en plein ciel","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Abell","original_name":"Tim Abell","popularity":0.3502,"profile_path":"/4LnqUNsQWUrF4Gq6YQdFiRHKEoP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ned Hatch","credit_id":"52fe4af79251416c910cb82d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Gregory Lee","original_name":"William Gregory Lee","popularity":0.2213,"profile_path":"/gjoSZus8Mg568nRbsbXwWxfafQD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bill","credit_id":"52fe4af79251416c910cb831","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tia Carrere","original_name":"Tia Carrere","popularity":2.011,"profile_path":"/rnHioNQkSmBAMgEBseu9bu6vw9l.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kate Parks","credit_id":"52fe4af79251416c910cb835","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":62001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dee Wallace","original_name":"Dee Wallace","popularity":1.217,"profile_path":"/gVnwovXGgGcny8LJ3w9j3I9xTE7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Polly","credit_id":"52fe4af79251416c910cb839","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Chokachi","original_name":"David Chokachi","popularity":0.5401,"profile_path":"/j5RTusstv11K2xMHdEIBjrWsGle.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jake Ross","credit_id":"52fe4af79251416c910cb849","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1190237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meghan McLeod","original_name":"Meghan McLeod","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/2hNSdIy3H2q4vynutBqfn8CB2wN.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Krista Miles","credit_id":"52fe4af79251416c910cb84d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":168172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Guilak","original_name":"Nicholas Guilak","popularity":0.1522,"profile_path":"/1FWDfWuckpU9rE9uMuxM02G2fjM.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Tabir","credit_id":"52fe4af79251416c910cb851","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3036815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Prinzo","original_name":"Chris Prinzo","popularity":0.152,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":24,"character":"Gus","credit_id":"679e775b7b4153a3b9955ad0","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Olen Ray","original_name":"Fred Olen Ray","popularity":0.6201,"profile_path":"/91Y7oLIYJjpoY0YmDEsswKfeqDg.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4af79251416c910cb83f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Olen Ray","original_name":"Fred Olen Ray","popularity":0.6201,"profile_path":"/91Y7oLIYJjpoY0YmDEsswKfeqDg.jpg","credit_id":"61a59901180dea009882ae03","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":564601,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kimberly A.
