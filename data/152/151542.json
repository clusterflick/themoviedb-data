A wall of sludge, debris, and water tore through the valley below, leaving in its wake 125 dead and 4,000 homeless. Interviews with survivors, representatives of union and citizen’s groups, and officials of the Pittston Company are juxtaposed with actual footage of the flood and scenes of the ensuing devastation. As reasons for the disaster are sought out and examined, evidence mounts that company officials knew of the hazard in advance of the flood, and that the dam was in violation of state and federal regulations. The Pittston Company, however, continued to deny any wrongdoing, maintaining that the disaster was an “act of God.”","popularity":0.0512,"poster_path":"/ixQmZN3aQsLahwEF37Qjujulg4P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Buffalo Creek Flood: An Act of Man","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mimi Pickering","original_name":"Mimi Pickering","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4b059251416c910cd491","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0495814","wikidata_id":"Q2330129","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ixQmZN3aQsLahwEF37Qjujulg4P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1975-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
