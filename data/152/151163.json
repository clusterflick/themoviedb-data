For more than 150 years, logging techniques remained the same. Men cut trees by hand and loaded them on horse-drawn sleds to be hauled over snow to the river. Skilled river drivers maneuvered the logs downstream, risking their limbs and lives every day. This film survives as a record of the long log business.","popularity":0.4824,"poster_path":"/cUSaQdIFvBHGW3azdYu7WO7TFw6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1930-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Stump to Ship","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfred Ames","original_name":"Alfred Ames","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4af99251416c910cbba3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1131074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Howard Kahn","original_name":"Howard Kahn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4af99251416c910cbba9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0347027","wikidata_id":"Q5505523","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cUSaQdIFvBHGW3azdYu7WO7TFw6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":188337,"name":"logging"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
