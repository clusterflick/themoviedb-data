The music sounds more or less like a Bob James small-group date with Ritenour as a major soloist. The style is between jazz, R&B, and pop with an emphasis on lightweight originals, soulful and moderately funky rhythms, and predictable radio-friendly music. Nothing unexpected occurs, but fans of James and Ritenour should enjoy both this CD and Fourplay in general.","popularity":0.5081,"poster_path":"/bGT9bZTV5mKKNVDWznCCVU27Mm9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Evening of Fourplay","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"An Evening of Fourplay - Volumes 1 & 2","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"An Evening of Fourplay - The Smoothjazz Loft","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"An Evening of Fourplay (1993)","type":"DVD"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1131432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob James","original_name":"Bob James","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/3x92WEKIw3ygmMfwPbhoqtGnWqW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself - Keyboards","credit_id":"52fe4af79251416c910cb7b1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1055164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Ritenour","original_name":"Lee Ritenour","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/5icR0fSuVRWpaOCnw3KvQsvME5t.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself - Guitar","credit_id":"52fe4af79251416c910cb7bb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275373,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Harvey Mason","original_name":"Harvey Mason","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/r3v1dQqZJTTiMWWNljHlMu3qbDX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself - Drums","credit_id":"52fe4af79251416c910cb7bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan East","original_name":"Nathan East","popularity":0.281,"profile_path":"/7Jsma80Gl2fvHNpVqsdGtOkNgiW.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Himself - Bass","credit_id":"5ea6d06e9c24fc001fd5e645","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":122099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chaka Khan","original_name":"Chaka Khan","popularity":0.4215,"profile_path":"/qTrSlB1oOtEFI8VsivF1JuZgcRT.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Herself - Vocals","credit_id":"52fe4af79251416c910cb7c3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Bailey","original_name":"Philip Bailey","popularity":0.0832,"profile_path":"/7bABsKENoddTXqZibbtGBMemavX.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Himself - Vocals","credit_id":"5ea6e02ea2d2e9001adf3c06","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Perry","original_name":"Phil Perry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/4YUA82W4yELLd5B4kf1BsgrvvZv.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Himself - Vocals","credit_id":"52fe4af79251416c910cb7cb","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stanley Dorfman","original_name":"Stanley Dorfman","popularity":0.0592,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4af79251416c910cb7b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0238208","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.724,"height":950,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bGT9bZTV5mKKNVDWznCCVU27Mm9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":688}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
