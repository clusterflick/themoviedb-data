Laurel and Hardy are shown battling a gum machine, and Hardy is a debaucherous Romeo whose amorous plans are thwarted by Rex, the Wonder Horse. Charley Chase is hampered by hiccups and a female professor, and he fleeces a drunken Oliver Hardy with a mannequin in a nightclub. The third part finds bachelor Buster Keaton desperately trying to get married by 7:00 PM in order to collect a $7-million-dollar inheritance. Keaton is pursued by money-hungry prospects in one of the best chase scenes ever filmed. Narration is provided by Jay Jackson.","popularity":0.3276,"poster_path":"/aXAWDAcvaoZGedpC7MCyDh493WJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25,"logo_path":"/qZCc1lty5FzX30aOCVRBLzaVmcp.png","name":"20th Century Fox","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"4 Clowns","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stan Laurel","original_name":"Stan Laurel","popularity":0.5677,"profile_path":"/eT15ERUT5T3CVyf2a9JD1VAzC6q.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"(archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4af99251416c910cbc19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Hardy","original_name":"Oliver Hardy","popularity":1.0454,"profile_path":"/qRMGQo5oWwcLpwgXSoArXK5riwe.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"(archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4af99251416c910cbc1d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buster Keaton","original_name":"Buster Keaton","popularity":1.3068,"profile_path":"/ejJz8YWn1Dr1PFn6E70NZ0oZ6o6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"(archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4af99251416c910cbc25","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Jackson","original_name":"Jay Jackson","popularity":0.0806,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Narration (voice)","credit_id":"53faaa5c0e0a267a720065cc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charley Chase","original_name":"Charley Chase","popularity":0.3584,"profile_path":"/bIJBRLtjiZtrq3c9uDYn1Cl5a7J.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"(archive footage)","credit_id":"57d04f1d92514173ac0012d7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1022676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Youngson","original_name":"Robert Youngson","popularity":0.1454,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4af99251416c910cbc15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0146398","wikidata_id":"Q3791256","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fhPHpizyR1AjmygOokgkjbdfzWY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zoopIo8qFMZbG3pyj7TjVovKm2I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aXAWDAcvaoZGedpC7MCyDh493WJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
