The top models of the era, including several who are advertising household products, are in the cast. The plot centers around a chic boutique, whose owner, George Curson (Warner Baxter), tries hard to please his customers while keeping peace with his unhappy wife. A wealthy young woman, Wendy Van Klettering (Joan Bennett), decides to take a job as a model at the fashion house, just to amuse herself, but her presence annoys Curson, who must put together the best possible show to compete with rival fashion houses at the Seven Arts Ball. The film includes several hit songs, including the Oscar-nominated \"That Old Feeling\" by Sammy Fain and Lew Brown.","popularity":1.2365,"poster_path":"/nhrOyXnf3k1Vz4UQxMWmk3cYIx6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34103,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walter Wanger Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Revelation in Entertainment!","title":"Vogues of 1938","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warner Baxter","original_name":"Warner Baxter","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/vX605wp5rnjezGUnsTSrFse5tPy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"George Curson","credit_id":"52fe4b119251416c910cebc3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Bennett","original_name":"Joan Bennett","popularity":0.6664,"profile_path":"/3xKU8SKCytMMBeIXzfZXvwaq0oO.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Wendy Van Klettering","credit_id":"52fe4b119251416c910cebc7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Vinson","original_name":"Helen Vinson","popularity":0.3157,"profile_path":"/8hoGY2a62SHP5A1FovtCRTWphY1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mary Curson","credit_id":"52fe4b119251416c910cebcb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mischa Auer","original_name":"Mischa Auer","popularity":0.2779,"profile_path":"/7mCfBcUq6FedSlD9lT6AWR3bIou.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Prince Muratov","credit_id":"52fe4b119251416c910cebcf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Mowbray","original_name":"Alan Mowbray","popularity":0.3212,"profile_path":"/tKkLxKHzZLhu675x7ehZ3gq2DVC.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Henry Morgan","credit_id":"52fe4b119251416c910cebd3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerome Cowan","original_name":"Jerome Cowan","popularity":0.402,"profile_path":"/79be685su9LMAr41HMVKby0FsTg.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"W.
