Existentialist rather than optimist, the approach is one of humanistic atheism, accepting death as part of life. Interviews with doctors and nurses explore their outlook; all speak of death as a fact, without either sentimentality or religiosity. The studied objectivity of the film only imperfectly hides an intense emotionality.","popularity":0.1556,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":158556,"logo_path":null,"name":"Krátký film Praha – Studio dokumentárních filmů","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1966-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A multilayered documentary film draws the viewer into a hospital environment, where we meet not only patients, with their fears, pains, and joys, but also doctors.","title":"Reflection","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","title":"Život","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543889,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Kačer","original_name":"Jan Kačer","popularity":0.3721,"profile_path":"/timEecIzAb4qqTkmI3w9OfeBVyr.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Recitation (voice)","credit_id":"62555c2f976a2300663eb1af","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1035927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evald Schorm","original_name":"Evald Schorm","popularity":0.1199,"profile_path":"/jvNWNkMy9DdrhZEiYjSlNgUjMGj.jpg","credit_id":"62555b67976a2300663eaf8d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588762,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jan Klusák","original_name":"Jan Klusák","popularity":0.0919,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62555bbc1b1f3c0f8ea53856","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2002661,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Antonín Kleisner","original_name":"Antonín Kleisner","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62555b936082eb04dbb082b8","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1131495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Špáta","original_name":"Jan Špáta","popularity":0.1215,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62555b84976a230050275b01","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1035927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evald Schorm","original_name":"Evald Schorm","popularity":0.1199,"profile_path":"/jvNWNkMy9DdrhZEiYjSlNgUjMGj.jpg","credit_id":"62555b62976a230050275aae","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1131495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Špáta","original_name":"Jan Špáta","popularity":0.1215,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62555b736082eb04dbb08277","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1131495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Špáta","original_name":"Jan Špáta","popularity":0.1215,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62555b6fc56d2d006718e934","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2429111,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vlasta Styblíková","original_name":"Vlasta Styblíková","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62555b8c1b1f3c0f3d460a79","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1959456,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Máša Charouzdová","original_name":"Máša Charouzdová","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62555ba0aaec7100505d3771","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1035927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evald Schorm","original_name":"Evald Schorm","popularity":0.1199,"profile_path":"/jvNWNkMy9DdrhZEiYjSlNgUjMGj.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4b019251416c910ccb69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4853635,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Václav Borovička","original_name":"Václav Borovička","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66a644e1ec37dd9c383a13ff","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0175367","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice Film Festival","release_date":"1965-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Together with Bloudění","release_date":"1966-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
