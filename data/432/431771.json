Meanwhile, Inspector LeGrasse investigates a spate of bizarre killings around the town, in which the victims have been decapitated and drained of blood. LeGrasse believes the murders may be linked to a Cthulhu cult active in the nearby towns of Innsmouth and Dunwich - that was headed by Asenath's late father Ephraim Waite.
