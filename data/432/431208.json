The main music is set to the rousing theme from \"The Magnificent Yankee\" composed by David Raksin in 1950. The promo is narrated by some of the best voice-over actors of the time, and is an excellent time capsule of a by-gone era.","popularity":0.3857,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lionpower from MGM","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Foy","original_name":"Fred Foy","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"585ade209251416fad07c0f2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2656972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Weber","original_name":"Karl Weber","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5ecedaffaaec71002067dc8a","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0256885","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":209733,"name":"promotional"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
