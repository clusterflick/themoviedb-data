They are located in a large industrial area of ​​North London. Before the discovery of natural gas in the North Sea in the 1960s, they were made from coal. Every town had a gasworks, where gas was processed from coal, and each gasworks included a large storage device, a telescopic metal drum, often contained within an iron frame. Most of them were built between 1860 and 1890. However, my main interest with film is how the supports filter, reflect, refract and break up the light that falls on them. Lattice columns and circular beams generate complex patterns of overlapping shadow movements and light shifts.","popularity":0.0687,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gasometers 3","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145496,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicky Hamlyn","original_name":"Nicky Hamlyn","popularity":0.1082,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65dcd0f1f6fd1801635810ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
