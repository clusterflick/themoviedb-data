His father hovers at the edge of the picture, so Ricky provides for himself and his mom through prostitution, running errands, and acting as a caregiver for a blind man. Through the course of the film, Ricky befriends Janey, a young woman he finds beaten by her ex-boyfriend, and Trenn, a mysterious young man in trouble with the law. The three of them navigate a dark and confusing world.  It uses many of the actors who have come to constitute the Dar A Luz company, including Tony Torn, Tom Fitzpatrick, Juliana Francis, and Tom Pearl. It will disappoint those who approach it looking for a film analogue of the “faster and louder” aesthetic that critics have used to characterize much of Abdoh’s stage work. The Blind Owl does use a variety of techniques reminiscent of his stage direction, giving it an unusual theatricality.","popularity":0.6025,"poster_path":"/ypZcGg3geydmTKZ66gv9p6fyBlH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blind Owl","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1318898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Jacobs","original_name":"Peter Jacobs","popularity":0.064,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"61ccad24a1353300433f0b38","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3098437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Pearl","original_name":"Tom Pearl","popularity":0.1649,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"61ccad318566d20042e1dc8f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1648754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Torn","original_name":"Tony Torn","popularity":0.17,"profile_path":"/dqu7CzsqSgFu2USNGl5oSNoiqHB.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Credited as Anthony Torn","credit_id":"61ccad7b92e55b0040d6e4bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":189883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliana Francis","original_name":"Juliana Francis","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"61ccad90a1353300953f11b3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Fitzpatrick","original_name":"Tom Fitzpatrick","popularity":0.1685,"profile_path":"/7OUqO0jvZfm5tSEWT6Cscooqsdp.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"61ccada3c995ee001e0bb382","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3362839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paulina Sahagun-Macias","original_name":"Paulina Sahagun-Macias","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"61ccadbe38520200a201ca2d","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1603498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Velicescu","original_name":"Adrian Velicescu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ccab6503bf840060637c36","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1603498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Velicescu","original_name":"Adrian Velicescu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ccab856840cc0087016ca0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2070683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crocker Coulson","original_name":"Crocker Coulson","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ccab9d5249780041036482","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1886502,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Adam Soch","original_name":"Adam Soch","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ccabafd96c3c009e80aa8d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1726722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reza Abdoh","original_name":"Reza Abdoh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61ccabccbbcae000614fd8db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1726722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Reza Abdoh","original_name":"Reza Abdoh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"585cca0992514123b3005f54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1316245,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sadegh Hedayat","original_name":"Sadegh Hedayat","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a3970c7c860960298a80e4","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7061414","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pQrvKTBplK07XNX9FxAxacWAwNj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ypZcGg3geydmTKZ66gv9p6fyBlH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uauhpWIX7TL7LnMVaUCgQaw2EgX.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":549,"name":"prostitute"},{"id":231839,"name":"rent boy"},{"id":258533,"name":"gay theme"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
