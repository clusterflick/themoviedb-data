They do not reconcile, and ten years pass without contact. Marion becomes a society girl and spends her time at parties with her friends.

When she recieves the note, she laughs and tosses it on the floor, but, later, on a whim, decides to take all her drunken friends with her to visit him. When they arrive, Marion finds Henry dead, clutching her portrait in his hand. She sends her friends away and falls to her knees in remorse.
