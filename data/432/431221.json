The yearly live telecasts of Gian Carlo Menotti’s Amahl and the Night Visitors were a cherished Christmas tradition throughout the 1950s. In addition, since its premiere in 1951, Amahl has been performed regularly by community groups and small opera companies throughout the US, making it the single most popular American opera. This production, staged by the composer himself and originally telecast on Christmas Day, 1955, is a testament to the work’s enduring power to move the heart and stir the soul. Starring Rosemary Kuhlmann as the Mother and Bill McIver as Amahl. Members of the Symphony of the Air are under the direction of Thomas Schippers.","popularity":0.1288,"poster_path":"/lZmkmOK6vQG953m9vflKnvRQe3d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1955-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amahl and the Night Visitors","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill McIver","original_name":"Bill McIver","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Amahl","credit_id":"585b052e925141594102e3ac","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosemary Kuhlmann","original_name":"Rosemary Kuhlmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"585b0541c3a368258c079754","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew McKinley","original_name":"Andrew McKinley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"King Kaspar","credit_id":"585b05549251416201006628","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Aiken","original_name":"David Aiken","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"King Melchior","credit_id":"585b05729251416f63086a37","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leon Lishner","original_name":"Leon Lishner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"King Balthazar","credit_id":"585b0585c3a36806a707230b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Monachino","original_name":"Francis Monachino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Servant","credit_id":"585b0593c3a36827a5077762","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1238017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirk Browning","original_name":"Kirk Browning","popularity":0.1402,"profile_path":"/sqqMIpAeowuV9dFVYHmgeocOGMr.jpg","credit_id":"5b36b3b99251413c9b02e8bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lZmkmOK6vQG953m9vflKnvRQe3d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"},{"id":207317,"name":"christmas"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1955-12-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
