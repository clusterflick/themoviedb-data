Additionally, the film strongly illuminates how drug abuse is truly a mental disease that should be treated holistically, with modern medical and social services. Therefore, this emotional educational film depicts alarming statistics and substantiative research which prove that individuals should not be criminalized or incarcerated for suffering from a mental disorder (drug abuse) in which they greatly need rehabilitative assistance to overcome. Innovatively, this unprecedented documentary intensely shows how both the use of both Methamphetamine and Fentanyl have utterly destroyed the homeless population in Los Angeles, CA.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homeless Not Hopeless In America Ft. \"Brook\"","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4919819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Wayne Walton II","original_name":"Gregory Wayne Walton II","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66d6414482fccbc40c041f03","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4919820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby M","original_name":"Bobby M","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66d64149fb5a04b2ae4ceeb3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4919819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Wayne Walton II","original_name":"Gregory Wayne Walton II","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d64167a3c995702a45c587","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4919819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Wayne Walton II","original_name":"Gregory Wayne Walton II","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d6415ccfa2d46c8b9b8b67","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4919819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Wayne Walton II","original_name":"Gregory Wayne Walton II","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d641570909699461b657f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
