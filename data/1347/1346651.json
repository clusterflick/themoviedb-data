The film models a “better argument” between MoveOn co-founder Joan Blades and Tea Party Patriots co-founder Mark Meckler. The National Writing Project is disseminating the film to thousands of classroom teachers around the country along with prompts for reflection, dialogue and persuasive writing inspired by this short film. After viewing the film, students discuss its themes. They choose a theme to write about and their instructor guides them to craft an argument that is not only well researched, but also addresses a wide audience, including people who hold positions ideologically opposed to their own.","popularity":0.2576,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":230181,"logo_path":"/9bjMEufvWqfNp1ZpO9c9Vc9sdxf.png","name":"Citizen Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Living Room Conversation: Mark Meckler and Joan Blades","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3695128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Ball","original_name":"Sam Ball","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/uycEduSLLLetiVZA3WCYialkDp0.jpg","credit_id":"66d67a318efefdc5976acc61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4767195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Randy Bean","original_name":"Randy Bean","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d67aa095e7a36e614d0623","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4767199,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dan Soles","original_name":"Dan Soles","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d67ab5a87e318f70b66a90","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3103639,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Stilley Steiner","original_name":"Kate Stilley Steiner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d67acb1611bbb80f82cba9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4743218,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mike Shen","original_name":"Mike Shen","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d67b0f477254f2466f0002","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1420988,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sophie E.
