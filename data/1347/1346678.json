Monkey King is subdued. Red Kid is taken as a disciple of the Goddess of Mercy. As Monk Tripitaka and his disciples reach the Flaming Mountain, they are unable to pass through it. The monk sends Monkey to borrow the princess's magic fan to disperse the fire. But the Princess still bears a grudge over her son’s destiny, wielding her fan to slap Monkey away. Monkey transforms into a bug, landing in her tea and hitting her stomach. In pain, the Princess answers his request, but she lends him a fake fan. With his request turned down by Ox King, Monkey disguises as Ox to beguile the wife and get the fan. Ox King transforms into Pigsy to snatch back the fan. Taoist God Pagoda arrives to subdue Ox in the company of Red Kid. Ox finally relents and yields the fan, which extinguishes the flames and sees the monk and his disciples safely off to a new phase of their journey.","popularity":0.7698,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":96388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lan Kwong Film Co.","origin_country":""},{"id":238001,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hanyang
