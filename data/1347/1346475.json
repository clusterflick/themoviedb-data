He created a further 8 before his abdication in 1814. A few were aristocrats, but others were the sons of shopkeepers or tailors. The most favoured became princes and kings. Among their ranks were legendary figures such as Marshals Lannes, Ney, Soult, Davout and Masséna, but also less well know figures like Pérignon, Brune and Moncey. Our series explores the lives of all 26 Marshals, and ranks them according to our own judgement of their achievements as Marshals.","popularity":0.2708,"poster_path":"/xWXkwzXFYHoBieFUYEcWUsXTaTG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Epic History TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":181,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Napoleon's Marshals, Ranked","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4130796,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Nove","original_name":"Charles Nove","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66d706167e2adab8ad549702","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4920678,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Toby Groom","original_name":"Toby Groom","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d70659863c3c86d50db8ff","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4920679,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Toby Groom","original_name":"Toby Groom","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d706727eb9c9018d946a5d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4920680,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Toby Groom","original_name":"Toby Groom","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d706822f182781a9f01e0c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oeYbdIn9piWaajdyQostJee8gsN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1267,"iso_639_1":"iu","file_path":"/xWXkwzXFYHoBieFUYEcWUsXTaTG.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":891},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2742,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lW83FNwTtkgUvEAFlrKByExfrRl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1828}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4381,"name":"napoleon bonaparte"},{"id":33384,"name":"napoleonic wars"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Napoleon's Marshals, Ranked (All Parts)","key":"GyTb2lqiJe0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2024-04-04T13:37:42.000Z","id":"66d6107e011b3c924a2767ed"}]}}}
