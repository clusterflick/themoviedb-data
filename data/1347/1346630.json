The show made huge stars of its central characters including Richard O'Sullivan as Robin Tripp. The flat downstairs was home to landlords George and Mildred, who would later have their own successful spin-off series. The late Yootha Joyce excelled as the sex-starved Mildred, with Brian Murphy playing her hen-pecked husband.  In this documentary, Paula Wilcox, Sally Thomsett and Murphy share behind-the-scenes stories and, along with Christopher Biggins and Melvyn Hayes, celebrate the show's success, 50 years on.","popularity":0.057,"poster_path":"/vIBePx6Qfx7nrovWqXke6WdfnVH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man About The House: 50 Years Of Laughter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vIBePx6Qfx7nrovWqXke6WdfnVH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1175}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
