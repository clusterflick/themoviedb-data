Through 16mm film and lumen prints created using flowers and vegetation foraged near Todmorden Mills in Toronto, Pendulum questions notions of native and non-native plant species, chronicling their adaptation to rising CO2 levels and severe weather. The project envisions the future evolution of roadside weeds such as asters and goldenrods, now thriving on a former dump site turned wildflower preserve at Todmorden Mills.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lAP9YRryVYmCF9yBZ23G6Mwl6co.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pendulum","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1211357,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Kolcze","original_name":"Eva Kolcze","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/emVF7B54Ey5luNzDEgwV5JZM1Ug.jpg","credit_id":"66d671a74827b3abd8184800","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1505,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lAP9YRryVYmCF9yBZ23G6Mwl6co.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1003}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
