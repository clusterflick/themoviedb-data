The project was initiated by Bach Van Dyke, a self-proclaimed world-famous actor, director, producer, and model, who enlisted the help of a small team to bring his vision to life.  Despite Van Dyke's larger-than-life persona, the documentary offers a more grounded perspective on the program and its participants. Viewers can expect to encounter a colorful cast of characters, including Dr. Raymond Cism, a social media-savvy health doctor, and the program's students, Sheen, Jake, and Butch.","popularity":0.2199,"poster_path":"/2tTmiwtfHzjnsvtiSMH4vxCNAsK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102561,"logo_path":null,"name":"An Independent
