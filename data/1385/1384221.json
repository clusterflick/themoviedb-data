After liberation from Portuguese colonial rule, women actively participate in the construction of socialist society. The film presents its theme through conversations with three women who talk about their work (in the countryside, in a factory and in a hospital), their family life, their education and their participation in the fight to keep \"the armed bandits\" from South Africa away from the country . Along with the presentation of the women, the film also gives an impression of Mozambique's development from the time when the liberation movement FRELIMO broke the country from the Portuguese yoke.","popularity":0.1123,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":46509,"logo_path":null,"name":"Statens Filmcentral","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nu dages det søstre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1079370,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Vilstrup","original_name":"Li Vilstrup","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672d0fd6599da28980957880","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213254,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Judy Irola","original_name":"Judy Irola","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/pxdAlUcp2xmGjHmynV8At25oMbC.jpg","credit_id":"672d1019914bae94a1bbb7ae","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":50092,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Camilla Skousen","original_name":"Camilla Skousen","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672d10205a20459207415765","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
