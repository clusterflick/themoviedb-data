Filmmaker Kārlis Lesiņš becomes a ‘citizen-investigator’ and goes on the road to find out why after 30 years and with only few years before the intended launch of the Rail Baltica railway line, the construction of this EU-funded project is significantly behind the schedule, over the budget and may never be finished at all.  Kārlis follows the trail of Rail Baltica project, trying to get the answers - what has happened and what is happening? Traveling through all the involved countries, he meets officials, military personnel, investigative journalists, people whose land will be expropriated, employees implementing the project and potentially benefiting entrepreneurs, who open up to him with their versions of the story.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/bpwl23GMXVXKHc1W7oNCVyrbHa8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79143,"logo_path":"/qIa22fhd6RWz6zTDCgVAN6U0u7J.png","name":"Mistrus Media","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":6154,"logo_path":"/5YKiuLl1qnTI3ZX5yxF8ZdtQ4GH.png","name":"Allfilm","origin_country":"EE"},{"id":56475,"logo_path":"/esERw7L1N8H3Fh0WXC0W4zxgDJc.png","name":"Staron Film","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":8197,"logo_path":"/614xBoHyCqgiCK8qbGZXreholvh.png","name":"Beetz Brothers Film Production","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2024-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nord Express","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2019282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kārlis Lesiņš","original_name":"Kārlis Lesiņš","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/cf6jh5Y3bRE5afkIx0GpMXlEWSj.jpg","credit_id":"672e2e83a818713bdf494ea3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2246407,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ivo Skanstiņš","original_name":"Ivo Skanstiņš","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734d8c94c0d01863c76e32e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2506661,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Toms Krauklis","original_name":"Toms Krauklis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734d8dc799e7013b9f7ad8c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3822594,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Siim Škepast","original_name":"Siim Škepast","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734d8f050e9a3cc6a3d25da","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2100886,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elīna Gediņa-Ducena","original_name":"Elīna Gediņa-Ducena","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734d9025ccd2aab5680cc57","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2009798,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gints Grūbe","original_name":"Gints Grūbe","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/6GGLvVF0lsMjs8RsW6PR9S16eaR.jpg","credit_id":"6734d91d68083d05408a031c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1305565,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pille Rünk","original_name":"Pille Rünk","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734dcbbfb53ca2f3ec54676","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1481490,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Małgorzata Staroń","original_name":"Małgorzata Staroń","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734dccb68083d05408a03ba","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1682329,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Reinhardt Beetz","original_name":"Reinhardt Beetz","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734dcdd68083d05408a03d0","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2019282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kārlis Lesiņš","original_name":"Kārlis Lesiņš","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/cf6jh5Y3bRE5afkIx0GpMXlEWSj.jpg","credit_id":"6734dd574955eacd19ea1525","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5057394,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Inese Braže","original_name":"Inese Braže","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6734dd67ab339696024edd9f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34961038","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"lv","file_path":"/bpwl23GMXVXKHc1W7oNCVyrbHa8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
