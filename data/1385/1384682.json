Publicly demanding justice after the murder of her husband, Turner was kidnapped by a mob, hung up in a tree, set on fire, her child cut out and killed, and shot hundreds of times before being buried on-site in 1918.  Returning to the origins of cinema, filmed on the exact date and time of Turnerâ€™s lynching 105-years earlier, # 3 uses form, time, light, shadow, and landscape as metaphor to not only invoke the memory of Mary Turner, but to also ponder perspective relating to racial violence, violence against women, our failure to acknowledge our past, and the racial divide that continues to exist today in the schizophrenia of America life.","popularity":0.1625,"poster_path":"/bwq0RiEsGKxIeLuZHGqdP8H4Knh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"N/A","title":"Invocation of the Memory of Mary Turner, lynched on May 19, 1918","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5047637,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Justin Bozung","original_name":"Justin Bozung","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672e43a6f2880d1004f6c5f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bwq0RiEsGKxIeLuZHGqdP8H4Knh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":210184,"name":"1910s"},{"id":256932,"name":"south georgia"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"},{"id":287803,"name":"experimental cinema"},{"id":297188,"name":"mob-lynching"},{"id":342735,"name":"mary turner"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
