The footage was then mixed with clips from Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" and edited into an MTV format, which was projected onto the wide screen of the Beijing Theatre, where the shroud fashion models moved from the outside of the theatre into the inside of the theatre, walking freely in front of the screen, occasionally delivering ballots to the mailboxes. At this point, revolutionary songs, Enya's score, and funeral marches alternate, and a poppy patchwork of music, video acts, and props combine to form a kind of absurd self-eulogy-like martyrdom ritual.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Contemporary Shroud Fashion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2899731,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Li Wake","original_name":"Li Wake","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672d6b545a2045920741620d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"tv","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"cathayplay","release_date":"2024-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
