Portrays the children playing hide-and-seek with a mime, and shows the unsafe locations in which the children choose to hide: the trunk of a car, a construction pipe, an abandoned house, a railroad car, and an unused freezer. Concludes open-endedly as the mime fails to find the children.","popularity":0.0388,"poster_path":"/mOwMZPByCm5WXO83RZk5Pq5xeWT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119398,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jarvis Couillard Associates","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Safe Play: Danger Places","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5048600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitch Young Evans","original_name":"Mitch Young Evans","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mime","credit_id":"672ef07194c3bded93120dcb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5048604,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Wheatley","original_name":"David Wheatley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672ef0b0af9e9c6ea3df371b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5048605,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tom Carr","original_name":"Tom Carr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672ef0f2af9e9c6ea3df372b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5048607,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bill Figge","original_name":"Bill Figge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672ef105af9e9c6ea3df3735","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5048610,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Harber","original_name":"Richard Harber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672ef120f5a01ad065b88c43","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mOwMZPByCm5WXO83RZk5Pq5xeWT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1180,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hq4QM4VqFz1zDC1YefGQazWrxE8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":787}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
