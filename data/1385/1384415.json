Over 30 years later, now a veteran documentary filmmaker, Lucy returns to Kings Park for the first time since her discharge. Her journey back sparks a decade-long effort to face her past and learn the story of the now abandoned institution that once held her captive. Her meetings with other former patients, their families, and the hospital staff reveal the painful legacy of our state hospital system and the crisis left by its demise.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/csgqiqsFudbwERDEN85jGBdAeT4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kings Park: Stories from an American Mental Institution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3981325,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lucy Winer","original_name":"Lucy Winer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672d93a5ebe21def08c8ebdc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2286552","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2461,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/csgqiqsFudbwERDEN85jGBdAeT4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
