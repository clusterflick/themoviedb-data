Do it before night and your child will live.\" After a series of initially promising encounters end in disappointment, can she pull off the miracle she needs? Find out in this fable about human nature, a tale of self-discovery where the flow of music—performed by the excellent Mahler Chamber Orchestra, marking their 25th anniversary—follows the flow of life.","popularity":0.1401,"poster_path":"/lQGhUVgu1noSwjMjJVDs9n6Lb0K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Picture
