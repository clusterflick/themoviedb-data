Only lightning of the stormy night flashes in the dark atmosphere of teachers’ room.  Then we’re brought to a completely different setting – to a girl with her lover in a lovely countryside hotel. As soon as we return to school, we get to know other characters: school director, a prostrate man bent under the threat of horrible tragedy – one of the students, the greatest school patron’s daughter, has been kidnapped. Fortunately, he has somebody close to support him. Thus we meet the teacher, an odd character of noble lady, whose aims are clear and unreachable.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6pZ0n2ONQVtDciOEPTSWtc3jloG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84772,"logo_path":"/ecxopDT69LSCdrxd4PQ9FbHUBPa.png","name":"Lupus Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kidnapping of the Butchers Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6pZ0n2ONQVtDciOEPTSWtc3jloG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
