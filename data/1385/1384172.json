Lee: A Background Study","overview":"Robert E. Lee, born in Virginia in 1807, was deeply influenced by his Southern heritage and the legacy of his family, particularly his father, who served in the American Revolution. Raised by his mother, Lee learned values of self-control and integrity. He graduated second in his class from the United States Military Academy and had a distinguished military career, serving the Union before the Civil War. Despite his opposition to secession, he chose to lead the Confederate Army when Virginia seceded. Lee's military strategies were notable, achieving significant victories, yet he faced ultimate defeat at Gettysburg. After the war, he became president of Washington College, promoting peace and reconciliation while embodying principles of integrity and duty.","popularity":0.0875,"poster_path":"/yMSjYU6TlfxGtc2PphafsiWr7o6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96804,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coronet Instructional Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Robert E.
