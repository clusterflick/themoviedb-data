The feature-length film (88 min.) is comprised of eight shorter video chapters (3 to 20 min. each), or “modules,” that highlight past and present biological research on one of the most common and abundant –yet amazing and diverse–groups of songbirds in North America, the Juncos.  Each video chapter explores key themes in animal behavior, ecology, or evolution, and conveys the process of scientific research with high school and college science standards in mind.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/nwYEW3ZthJ8WOQkep7SnbnSXAA9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48566,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Science Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":104074,"logo_path":"/fEiBXFtNJMykJRsfp8MWGbwv4f1.png","name":"Indiana University","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Remarkable Biology From a Backyard Bird","title":"Ordinary Extraordinary Junco","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yaël Ksander","original_name":"Yaël Ksander","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"672d00e6599da289809576ee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045829,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ellen D.
