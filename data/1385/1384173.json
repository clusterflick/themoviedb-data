The possibilities are endless... But how do you avoid illustration? The aim of this experimental short film was to bring the viewer into the music. If jazz is a form in which musicians call out to each other, engage in dialogue and develop a musical idea in turn and together, the cinematographic approach here was inspired by this dynamic.  With the aid of a miniature camera, the viewer is taken to the source of the sounds. The lens is fixed to the bow of the violin, under the skin of the Darabouka, flush with the vibrating strings of the cello and guitar. The viewer is transported into a new universe, where the musicians' dialogue becomes a conversation in images, an exchange of shots, a shamanic dance.","popularity":0.055,"poster_path":"/3s3tsvChQZ0WpJ3IWalwYNVjLHT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1991-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le raton","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464188,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philippe Baylaucq","original_name":"Philippe Baylaucq","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672cfb5e5a2045920741541d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464188,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philippe Baylaucq","original_name":"Philippe Baylaucq","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672cfbf0ebe21def08c8dab2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1464188,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philippe Baylaucq","original_name":"Philippe Baylaucq","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672cfc02caf727f3748aa327","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9029220","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":803,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3s3tsvChQZ0WpJ3IWalwYNVjLHT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":531}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
