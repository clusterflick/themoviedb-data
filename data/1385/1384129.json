Mathematicians believed the problem to be unsolvable until 1958, when Stephen Smale proved otherwise. The motion of turning a sphere inside out, called a regular homotopy, is extremely difficult to visualize. The homotopy in this film was developed by Bernard Morin, a blind mathematician. The motion is illustrated with a sequence of chicken-wire models, built by Charles Pugh, showing the crucial stages in the motion. Commentary is provided by mathematicians Nelson L. Max, Stephen Smale, and Charles Pugh, and by physicist Judith Bregmann.","popularity":0.2405,"poster_path":"/6MtRb1DiWKetb0vOCG2vWK09WoH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":244095,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Topology Films Project","origin_country":""},{"id":244096,"logo_path":null,"name":"Case Western Reserve University","origin_country":""},{"id":112721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Education Development Center (E/D/C)","origin_country":""},{"id":163137,"logo_path":null,"name":"International Film Bureau","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Unfolding the impossible: turning a sphere inside out, without a single crease.","title":"Turning a Sphere Inside Out","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelson Max","original_name":"Nelson Max","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"672ce81c898d18e69096018f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Smale","original_name":"Stephen Smale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"672ce826ebe21def08c8d7de","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Pugh","original_name":"Charles Pugh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"672ce82efc658fd33c29f1bb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Bregman","original_name":"Judith Bregman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"672ce835898d18e69096019b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2039309,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nelson Max","original_name":"Nelson Max","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672ce855c748718bf0738f3b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Pugh","original_name":"Charles Pugh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672ce8bd599da289809574cc","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Modeling"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045671,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"James Blinn","original_name":"James Blinn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672ce8e226b605bc19e5cf1b","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2039309,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Nelson Max","original_name":"Nelson Max","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672ce918f2880d1004f693d9","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5045673,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"William Clifford, Jr","original_name":"William Clifford, Jr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"672ce933898d18e6909601ed","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23725246","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6MtRb1DiWKetb0vOCG2vWK09WoH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6009,"name":"mathematics"},{"id":224015,"name":"topology"},{"id":261146,"name":"number theory"},{"id":278823,"name":"3d animation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
