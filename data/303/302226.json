Doohan, Lawson, Mamola, Schwantz and Gardner made their marks on racing but even amongst these giants of the sport Rainey stood proud. Week-in-week-out, the riders engaged in high pressure wheel-to-wheel battles at some of the most iconic race circuits across the globe. Rewards for success were huge but the price to be paid for getting things wrong was severe â€“ Schwantz broke both wrists, Doohan shattered his leg and Wayne Rainey, who tasted success more than most, now has to use a wheelchair following a horrific crash at Misano. This is the story of Rainey's adrenaline fuelled career with input from friends, rivals, managers, journalists and the man himself.","popularity":0.3289,"poster_path":"/3GXHCudVFHSrRrnmqqaq6eGcfAX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42638,"logo_path":"/2OaKgYu0xLcgBKHjWM3hI3YkWSu.png","name":"Greenlight
