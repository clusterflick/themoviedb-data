The observational film follows three pairs of mothers and daughters who, despite their life experience, are still wrestling with their conflicting emotions, difficulties and sometimes ill-fated commitment to do what's best. The film captures the myriad of changing expectations and social adjustments that come into play when mothers and daughters find their roles reversed and mother becomes reliant on child due to finances, Alzheimer's or family feuding.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mom's Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1742074","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
