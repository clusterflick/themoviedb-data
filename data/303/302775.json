Highly stroboscopic and hallucinatory, these kinetic performances result in otherworldly spaces and plays of near-abstraction and suggestive imagery. In Krypton is Doomed, the audio accompaniment to the shifting visuals is an installment of a Superman radio play â€” the first ever broadcast, in 1940. This work highlights Jacobs' relentless experimentation with the very fabric of projected light.","popularity":0.2533,"poster_path":"/6ZgQVU2gCnN5TTlSnXw90efZ33B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Krypton Is Doomed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":930709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Jacobs","original_name":"Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/lLWmlUKswUHhW6TEHD4i56xleke.jpg","credit_id":"5464129cc3a36804a70007ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6562806","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":1316,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gr8yvrUKzkhOzV7SuZekFYK4tEh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":890},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6ZgQVU2gCnN5TTlSnXw90efZ33B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
