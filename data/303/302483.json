Goodness is a trait and disposition valued by God, as God can create nothing other than good. We were all created in the beginning all good. Children tend to exhibit this goodness most profoundly. We as parents must recognize and encourage this. Teaching and modeling these fruits for our children is a parent's spirituality in their regard.
