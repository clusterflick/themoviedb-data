The manufactured, unambiguously humorless profundity proffered up by other German contemporaries is absent here. Laughter is allowed. Kristl takes the dreadful liberty of tomfoolery, sending up himself, the characters, the action, \"tragedy,\" and everything else, including the audience, that might be held sacred. Within the framework of the action, we recognize a love triangle, one of the simplest of dramatic configurations. Not only the basic idea, but also numerous particulars, both in subject and style, are reminiscent of the films of Roman Polanski, which Kristl doubtless saw and holds in esteem. We meet two men: one is meant to embody the outsider, the artistic, intellectual, individualist. The other looks like the embodiment of the well-to-do man, the burgher, the functionary, the capitalist. The two battle for the favor of an indecisive and domineering girl.","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73301,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schleiermacher","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1385215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petra Nettelbeck","original_name":"Petra Nettelbeck","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Das gelähmte Mädchen","credit_id":"5464c1800e0a262946001f3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vlado Kristl","original_name":"Vlado Kristl","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Der 'Clown'","credit_id":"5464c18f0e0a262942001dbd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felix Potisk","original_name":"Felix Potisk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Der 'Spießer'","credit_id":"5464c1a40e0a26294f001eb1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erich Glöckler","original_name":"Erich Glöckler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"56c47c4f9251416ba9002229","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1578943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uwe Nettelbeck","original_name":"Uwe Nettelbeck","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Telefonstimme (voice)","credit_id":"56c47c5dc3a36871fd002335","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385211,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marlis Detjens","original_name":"Marlis Detjens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5464c1070e0a262938001f23","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385209,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michaela Berchtold","original_name":"Michaela Berchtold","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5464c0fcc3a36804b0001f0b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23316,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gérard Vandenberg","original_name":"Gérard Vandenberg","popularity":0.1332,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5464c0ecc3a36804ce001dad","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerhard Schumm","original_name":"Gerhard Schumm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5464c118c3a36804a3001e43","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385209,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michaela Berchtold","original_name":"Michaela Berchtold","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5464c0c10e0a262942001dab","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1385210,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Detten Schleiermacher","original_name":"Detten Schleiermacher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5464c0e0c3a36804a7001e41","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vlado Kristl","original_name":"Vlado Kristl","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5464c0b7c3a36804b4001cd1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vlado Kristl","original_name":"Vlado Kristl","popularity":0.1065,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5464c0a7c3a36804ac001e7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0319247","wikidata_id":"Q20729481","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
