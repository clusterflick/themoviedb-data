In northern India, Bhargava filmed the ravishing images of an eight-day Holi festival held in the city of Mathura, mythic birthplace of Krishna. Iyer – who released his ECM debut, Mutations, earlier this year – then composed his score as the musical complement to Bhargava’s beautiful visual ballet, drawing at times on the rhythms and chants of the Holi festival; the result is one of Iyer’s warmest, most colorful creations to date, as rich melodically as it is texturally. RADHE RADHE: Rites of Holi is a kaleidoscopic experience.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RADHE RADHE: Rites of Holi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1057532,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Prashant Bhargava","original_name":"Prashant Bhargava","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5462568f0e0a267bf800015f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1384601,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vijay Iyer","original_name":"Vijay Iyer","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"546256b70e0a267bfb000140","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
