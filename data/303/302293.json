In a lighthearted exchange, Michael Collins remarked 'OK, we'll keep a close eye out for the bunny girl!' Kate Liston used that story, and its conflation of symbols somehow lost in translation, to make the three-monitor installation Moon Rabbit during her residency in China at the time of the annual mooncake festival. Through the music of the Shangri-Las and using repeated words and phrases, the myth is replayed, subtly undermining the seductive and crass glamour of the Apollo programme. -BALTIC","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MOONRABBIT","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1384298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Liston","original_name":"Kate Liston","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5461553ac3a3686f35000b9a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
