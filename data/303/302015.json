Poemfield No. 2 features a soundtrack by jazz percussionist Paul Motian, known for his collaborations with Bill Evans.","popularity":0.0868,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poem Field No. 2","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Poemfield n°2","type":"alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Poemfield # 2","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568338,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Motian","original_name":"Paul Motian","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623f73445a9915005d4dcbb4","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1126159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stan VanDerBeek","original_name":"Stan VanDerBeek","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/2lQIoHSteolRdzxLINRCXzBX2yE.jpg","credit_id":"545ffa34c3a3680b5d001269","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1126207,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ken Knowlton","original_name":"Ken Knowlton","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6207f249e640d60043499a79","department":"Crew","job":"Digital Effects Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2607900","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1966-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
