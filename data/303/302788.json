The Kwaito Documentary","overview":"A musical trip through southern Africa to the tunes of the post-apartheid generation. Kwaito music originated in the 1950's in the dusty streets of South Africa's townships such as Sophiatown, Pimville and subsequently in Soweto. It is inseparable from the Pantsuela culture of the rebellious youth gangs during the Apartheid regime. Since there was no money for musical instruments or for extravagant costumes, they concentrated on their dancing and singing skills and, turning the streets into their stage. Currently almost fifty years later - Kwaito culture is experiencing a renaissance in a manner completely inconceivable in those days.","popularity":0.4807,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":38236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nippes Yard","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NA","name":"Namibia"}],"release_date":"2011-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yes-Ja!
