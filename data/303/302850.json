Filming the passion and energy on both sides of the crash barriers was no mean feat. The light show was a blitzkrieg of lasers, pulsating strobes and relentless lashings of red beams cutting through the bursts of blue. Alabama 3 played for the crowd refused to compromise with colour balanced, TV friendly illumination.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/mDILmwhdtI9KpYkOhdiRVQJupw4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Film of Alabama 3's concert at the London Astoria, December 14 2004","title":"Alabama 3: Hear the Train a' Comin'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0800306","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mDILmwhdtI9KpYkOhdiRVQJupw4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
