This powerful, inspiring documentary exposes James Dobson's Focus on the Family, a well-funded, politically powerful organization that assaults the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and their families.  Interweaving stories of courage and commitment and interviews with movement leaders such as Mel White of Soulforce, Judy Shepard of the Matthew Shepard Foundation, and actor and activist Chad Allen, SoleJourney shows how a small group of individuals take action against a colossal adversary - including a six-day, 65 mile march from the Colorado State Capitol in Denver to the Focus on the Family's headquarters in Colorado Springs.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SoleJourney","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5640726","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
