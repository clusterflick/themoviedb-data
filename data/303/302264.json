His offer of a caravan on a cliff top and promises of the Klondyke that awaits them at least seem preferable to the violent marriage she has left behind. The film sets Betty's struggle for survival against the wider struggles of the seacoaling community, surviving on the fringes of capitalism. Despite the exploitation by a local entrepreneur, run-ins with dole snoops and School Board men and the ever encroaching regulations of a hostile council, their lives retain a kind of anarchic romance, which is reflected in the film's lyrical style.","popularity":0.1163,"poster_path":"/ptlBtpecd39gYVDNbMpVIg7gYsd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38052,"logo_path":"/8uZNsz3zVarlswxx3CDBtfLPgMT.png","name":"Amber
