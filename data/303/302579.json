Of American Indian ancestry, but adopted by white foster parents as young children, each sister has her own identity issues and each has chosen a very different career path. Now dedicated to starting a Native cosmetic business, they attempt to overcome obstacles both in the business world and in the home. A touching love story of family and culture, Naturally Native also interweaves a subtle, but strong wake-up call regarding the treatment of Native people in corporate America. Naturally Native also provides some insight into tribal infrastructure and gaming issues.","popularity":1.5453,"poster_path":"/yTQPrKLhKC8qUe2CMn8MxmfaxA5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red-Horse Native
