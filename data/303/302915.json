At home in Minneapolis with Lynette, her wife of twenty years, s/he's Steve. Born male, Venus is transgender. S/he's \"in between\" â€” taking female hormones, but not planning to have sexual reassignment surgery. To some, s/he's a pioneer, courageously exploring a brave new world of gender identity, free of categorization. To others, s/he's a freak. VENUS OF MARS is both the unique coming out story of Venus' gender-redefining journey, and the truly contemporary love story of a couple weathering dramatic changes in uncharted relationship territory.","popularity":0.6656,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The eye-catching transgender singer of a Minneapolis glam rock band and her wife negotiate the frontiers of love and gender.","title":"Venus of Mars","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1750368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Venus DeMars","original_name":"Venus DeMars","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"589622029251412e0d00dd56","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1750369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynette Reini-Grandell","original_name":"Lynette Reini-Grandell","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5896220cc3a36808ab00dafa","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1750372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Goldberg","original_name":"Emily Goldberg","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58962285c3a36808ab00db57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1330064","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33973,"name":"glam rock"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
