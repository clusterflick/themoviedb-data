Glossy magazines are cut up and reconfigured, newspaper pages are defaced with animated squiggles, comic-book superheroes fly out, over and through at superspeed. Pictures appear only to burn up or be torn apart, toys dance in ferocious stop-motion before melting into pools of plastic decay, a hammer plunges down on an image of the assembled House of Commons - all to a crackly soundtrack of treated shortwave static. It is a hyperkinetic panorama of 1960s popular culture in meltdown, where seemingly nothing stays still for more than a single frame, as the artist ejaculates ideas onto the screen faster than the eye can properly register. Lasting just three minutes, Cineblatz is exhilarating, orgasmic even--but also thoroughly exhausting.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cineblatz","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Cineblatz","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Cine Blatz","type":"On screen title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1204341,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Keen","original_name":"Jeff Keen","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/ok6zYau5XhyAC9y8OA0AF36DtlW.jpg","credit_id":"53c9f4060e0a264750000e83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1666743","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
