Back in 1944, he landed with 150,000 other troops on the beaches of Normandy, France, for the D-Day invasion. Despite the war around him, he couldn’t help but notice the fishing potential of the rivers he and his fellow troops crossed as they made their way into France. Seventy years later, reflecting on his life, Moore is compelled to return to Normandy, this time armed not with a gun but with fly rod and reel. Waller’s inspirational film follows Moore on his arduous physical and emotional journey from home on the North Umpqua River, where for years he has fished and tended the famed Steamboat Inn, to the battlefields of his youth.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mending the Line","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1343372,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Moore","original_name":"Frank Moore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"53c98420c3a368777e000030","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Moore","original_name":"Jeanne Moore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"53c98428c3a3687794000034","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Waller","original_name":"John Waller","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53c98406c3a368778a000043","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
