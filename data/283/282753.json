In Kansas City, pop culture is something to be twisted and reshaped, relationships are either nonexistent or refabricated, and time is unstructured and teasing. At the heart of these girls' lives—and this innovative work of cinema—is a quest for understanding and a sense of place. The risks run and solutions posed engender both laughs and tears. The film's amateur actors and nonlinear narrative bring an unnerving, utterly human face to the challenges of young womanhood in a world that would prefer that girls watch the Disney Channel.","popularity":0.2653,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stay the Same Never Change","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abby Bavley","original_name":"Abby Bavley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Abby","credit_id":"53c9f8790e0a264745000f2d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Boullear","original_name":"Emily Boullear","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Emily","credit_id":"53c9f8b40e0a264748000edf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tate Buck","original_name":"Tate Buck","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tate","credit_id":"53c9f8c30e0a264750000f91","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cyan Meeks","original_name":"Cyan Meeks","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Cyan","credit_id":"53c9f8da0e0a26473f000f8c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Montgomery","original_name":"Annie Montgomery","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Annie","credit_id":"53c9f8eb0e0a26473f000f96","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343538,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Nichols","original_name":"Mary Nichols","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Mary","credit_id":"53c9f8f90e0a264750000fa0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Potratz","original_name":"Julie Potratz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Julie","credit_id":"53c9f9190e0a264750000fa8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paige Sanders","original_name":"Paige Sanders","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Paige","credit_id":"53c9f9a40e0a264753000f47","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcia Trayford","original_name":"Marcia Trayford","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Marcia","credit_id":"53c9f9c50e0a264750000fca","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Faber","original_name":"Matthew Faber","popularity":0.1528,"profile_path":"/7AN24bHosFTglFqsqSyCRioLLUf.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Yoga Instructor","credit_id":"5fbf0cc735c30a003e57df47","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343550,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Owen Ashworth","original_name":"Owen Ashworth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53c9fa980e0a264742000fe7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurel Nakadate","original_name":"Laurel Nakadate","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/i61zC5RMAf5sU7xwhDBYxUIxj5z.jpg","credit_id":"53c9faa60e0a264748000f44","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurel Nakadate","original_name":"Laurel Nakadate","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/i61zC5RMAf5sU7xwhDBYxUIxj5z.jpg","credit_id":"53c9fa770e0a264750000ff7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurel Nakadate","original_name":"Laurel Nakadate","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/i61zC5RMAf5sU7xwhDBYxUIxj5z.jpg","credit_id":"53c9fa810e0a264753000f6c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurel Nakadate","original_name":"Laurel Nakadate","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/i61zC5RMAf5sU7xwhDBYxUIxj5z.jpg","credit_id":"53c9fab10e0a26474b00102d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1340616","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
