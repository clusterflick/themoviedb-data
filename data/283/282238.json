Associated through mutual friendships, these cultural dissidents looked for new ways and means to express themselves. Soon their writings found an audience and the American media took notice, dubbing them the Beat Generation. Members of this group included writers Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg. a trinity that would ultimately influence the works of others during that era, including the \"hippie\" movement of the '60s.  In this 55-minute video narrated by Allen Ginsberg, members of the Beat Generation (including the aforementioned Burroughs, Anne Waldman, Peter Orlovsky, Amiri Baraka, Diane Di Prima, and Timothy Leary) are reunited at Naropa University in Boulder, CO during the late 1970's to share their works and influence a new generation of young American bohemians.","popularity":0.585,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fried Shoes Cooked Diamonds","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Ginsberg","original_name":"Allen Ginsberg","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/w7qQvokS1lp7IRgefiJdALaaiIi.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53c67761c3a368626c001f6f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Orlovsky","original_name":"Peter Orlovsky","popularity":0.1109,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53c6776cc3a36862470020ed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Leary","original_name":"Timothy Leary","popularity":0.1858,"profile_path":"/kFTPQ1ood6HKh1hRRr4wLe76JHN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53c67783c3a3686260002053","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amiri Baraka","original_name":"Amiri Baraka","popularity":0.4428,"profile_path":"/fFEeu2AhKdyHvtQO3bsvVfhCtM0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53c67791c3a3686266001ff6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1129756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Corso","original_name":"Gregory Corso","popularity":0.1131,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"53c6779bc3a36862470020f5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6471,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William S.
