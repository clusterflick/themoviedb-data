An award-winning hybrid of documentary and drama that lets teenagers act out their lives in a West Yorkshire council estate. Trevor is a typical seventeen year old dosser living on a housing estate in the North of England. He smokes ‘blow’, joyrides and burgles houses, and also writes poetry. His muse is his next door neighbour, sixteen year old Amie. Every morning he works on a poem that will express his feelings and maybe win Amie’s heart.","popularity":0.2386,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":288,"logo_path":"/aW0IpM9d4Zjj978EqgDVSxXXhTj.png","name":"BBC Film","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1998-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twockers","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1790992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trevor Wademan","original_name":"Trevor Wademan","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Trevor","credit_id":"58e65c50925141354c0032ee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1790993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Mason","original_name":"Stephen Mason","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Steve","credit_id":"58e65c8592514179de0364b5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1790994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amie Oie","original_name":"Amie Oie","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Amie","credit_id":"58e65c95925141354c00332c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1790995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Gradon","original_name":"Peter Gradon","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Factory Boss","credit_id":"58e65cae92514127ec044e63","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1790996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Murphy","original_name":"Jimmy Murphy","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Fence","credit_id":"58e65cba9251412819040964","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1790997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Wademan","original_name":"Craig Wademan","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Trevor's Brother","credit_id":"58e65cc992514179de0364e2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1790998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donna Proctor","original_name":"Donna Proctor","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Amie's Friend","credit_id":"58e65cd6c3a36872ee043dd7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1790999,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liam McLaughlin","original_name":"Liam McLaughlin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Kid with Guy Fawkes","credit_id":"58e65ce592514134eb003524","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gavin Cochrane","original_name":"Gavin Cochrane","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Kid with Guy Fawkes","credit_id":"58e65cf19251412810041027","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791001,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Mellonie","original_name":"Jerry Mellonie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Shopkeeper","credit_id":"58e65cfdc3a368730203dc83","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1791002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valerie Hagan","original_name":"Valerie Hagan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Clairvoyant","credit_id":"58e65d0bc3a3684aa4031be1","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paweł Pawlikowski","original_name":"Paweł Pawlikowski","popularity":0.2521,"profile_path":"/vzhGoaJpQrJV8arrz2px7J0yMCF.jpg","credit_id":"53c5da77c3a3686251001451","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":215102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger McGough","original_name":"Roger McGough","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58e65d5e92514134eb003584","department":"Crew","job":"Poem"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1316077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ian Duncan","original_name":"Ian Duncan","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59729dc5c3a3681593025ddd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0454971","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (BFI London)","release_date":"1998-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
