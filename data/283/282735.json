Arunas Matelis traces the beginnings of post-Soviet transformation not in the main squares of Vilnius but observes it in the daily life of the inhabitants of Užupis–a historical quarter of the old town of Vilnius. The film, awarded in the Oberhausen, Bornholm and Pärnu film festivals, was also screened as a feature in the Cannes Film Festival.","popularity":0.098,"poster_path":"/247a6WvPsjP8iGr43oSrROxHLmp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1990-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ten Minutes Before the Flight of Icarus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":550068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arūnas Matelis","original_name":"Arūnas Matelis","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/oIZZkntuWV2YhAWOW1XAUFUxEfF.jpg","credit_id":"53c9db360e0a264753000aba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":550068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arūnas Matelis","original_name":"Arūnas Matelis","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/oIZZkntuWV2YhAWOW1XAUFUxEfF.jpg","credit_id":"5c8075990e0a2643105d3b9a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1599061,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Faustas Latėnas","original_name":"Faustas Latėnas","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/bL3XHWdjkIFUdQB7uF35Zumldke.jpg","credit_id":"5c8075a5c3a3684e98d4c5dc","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5724506","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.621,"height":950,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/247a6WvPsjP8iGr43oSrROxHLmp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":590}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
