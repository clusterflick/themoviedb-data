He appeals to Cardinal Wolsey to set aside the tenets of the Church and consent to his divorce from the Queen. The cardinal absolutely refuses to do anything so inimical to his office, as representative of the Holy See. Angered King Henry induces the Archbishop of Canterbury to call a special council through which he divorces himself from Queen Catherine. In punishment for his refusal to accede to the king's wishes, the cardinal is exiled to Leicester Abbey where he dies three days afterward, conscious that he had sustained the sacredness of his office, a martyr to his faith and of service to his king.","popularity":0.3652,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cardinal Wolsey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1341799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Reid","original_name":"Hal Reid","popularity":0.0584,"profile_path":"/whvJPsWDZGlmw6peaHP7hQKTghm.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Cardinal Wolsey","credit_id":"53c4fb74c3a3682476001372","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1033217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Swayne Gordon","original_name":"Julia Swayne Gordon","popularity":0.1407,"profile_path":"/9xKPzh1DDCLFFh78c7l9SsOGe5r.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Catherine of Aragon","credit_id":"53c4fb7bc3a368246e0012a0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1023476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Kimball Young","original_name":"Clara Kimball Young","popularity":0.0972,"profile_path":"/zMsyHsgLM1XuZyQlYPVeepATc5o.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Anne Boleyn","credit_id":"53c4fb84c3a368246b00124c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tefft Johnson","original_name":"Tefft Johnson","popularity":0.1436,"profile_path":"/ioAvdqZHSTOSwZcVeNamE0BBAfl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"King Henry VIII","credit_id":"60c5fd3f944a57002a8f5dab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Gaillard","original_name":"Robert Gaillard","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/m5QWpQiBXRETL3ujyamQdykNkhh.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Gardiner, later Bishop of Winchester","credit_id":"60c5fd58944a57002a8f5dba","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3123609,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Logan Paul","original_name":"Logan Paul","popularity":0.0605,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury","credit_id":"60c5fd9e47c9fb0029e0bac9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1482971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Ober","original_name":"George Ober","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bishop of Essex","credit_id":"60c5fdaf48333a0079b71c12","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1207226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Wilson","original_name":"Hal Wilson","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/o6v1TNGi5YqDeayaAB3UshIb8xF.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"King's friend (as Harold Wilson)","credit_id":"60c5fdc493828e00286c1eb1","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100017,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.
