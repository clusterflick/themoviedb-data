He smuggled his film out and placed it in the hands of Frontier Films. Leyda, Lerner, Meyers and Maddow (they had to use pseudonyms) spent four months preparing the film for publication. In that time, the Chinese situation altered to such an extent that Frontier had to change the scenario several times in order to keep up with events...the producers had to make a happy change in the theme of China Strikes Back. It was no longer a film showing the Chinese people moving toward unity. It became a pictorial history revealing the how and why behind a realized unity.","popularity":0.1148,"poster_path":"/40IC1n90A4fiWyYGobOnfaE3dD9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frontier Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"China Strikes Back","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1342309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teh Chu","original_name":"Teh Chu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Mao's military leader","credit_id":"53c65f3d0e0a267fe5002061","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1001615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mao Zedong","original_name":"Mao Zedong","popularity":0.1819,"profile_path":"/nuQSpbdD2i4jvBDB0TnvoVbD493.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"53c65f440e0a267fea002083","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Dunham","original_name":"Harry Dunham","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53c65f0c0e0a267ff7001f06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10536,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex North","original_name":"Alex North","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56ebefeb9251414dba000c93","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83918,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irving Lerner","original_name":"Irving Lerner","popularity":0.208,"profile_path":"/3ovHPVyUn1gu5ynANyvufFUikrd.jpg","credit_id":"56ebefd8c3a3682253002451","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0128994","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/40IC1n90A4fiWyYGobOnfaE3dD9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1937-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
