Though their films would grow in thematic complexity, Rumpot already shows the visual energy, dynamic music, and anarchic, twisted plot development that so endear the Kuchars to audiences. The outlandish makeup and onscreen behavior would make Jack Smith (of Flaming Creatures) proud. In this context, a sudden moment of feigned modesty (when one woman is discovered undressing) is ironic indeed. --Andy Ditzler","popularity":0.181,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Was a Teenage Rumpot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louie Colon","original_name":"Louie Colon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"53c9f6600e0a264748000e49","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Fisher","original_name":"Edith Fisher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53c9f66c0e0a264750000f09","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343515,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Katz","original_name":"Esther Katz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"53c9f6780e0a26473c000e89","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arline Roman","original_name":"Arline Roman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"53c9f6810e0a264750000f13","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Thorner","original_name":"Lloyd Thorner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"53c9f6980e0a26474b000f58","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2013623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Ross","original_name":"Harry Ross","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5ac23813c3a3682d1a01c8ba","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Kuchar","original_name":"George Kuchar","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/pFB8luGSfUrfmI8YUd1ulYGUzUB.jpg","credit_id":"53c9f6da0e0a26473f000f20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120941,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Kuchar","original_name":"Mike Kuchar","popularity":0.0839,"profile_path":"/lw5oEJtwfHwxEV6zfeE05EMqeB7.jpg","credit_id":"53c9f6e60e0a26474b000f63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0252530","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1960-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
