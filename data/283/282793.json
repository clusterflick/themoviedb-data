The film is at turns comic, wistful and romantic.","popularity":0.1158,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":27876,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films André Ghilbert","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1929-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rayon de soleil","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"L'effet d'un rayon de soleil sur Paris","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":244491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mona Goya","original_name":"Mona Goya","popularity":0.0865,"profile_path":"/lIvazfPsJiZ5De2nQgLpMEcq9UO.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"53ca860c0e0a26473f0026a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Péclet","original_name":"Georges Péclet","popularity":0.2148,"profile_path":"/8Ll0PBipZo7T4sIzItQSFSnLlnw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53ca86150e0a26473c0024fe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monsieur de Villette","original_name":"Monsieur de Villette","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"53ca861d0e0a26475000265d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1342410,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Nasthasio","original_name":"Mario Nasthasio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"53ca86280e0a26474b002669","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1343756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Gourguet","original_name":"Jean Gourguet","popularity":0.0581,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53ca86400e0a264750002669","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georges Péclet","original_name":"Georges Péclet","popularity":0.2148,"profile_path":"/8Ll0PBipZo7T4sIzItQSFSnLlnw.jpg","credit_id":"53ca86500e0a26474b00266d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1343761,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"André Riigaud","original_name":"André Riigaud","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a20509c3a36858c8011a2e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1342005,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lucien Bellavoine","original_name":"Lucien Bellavoine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56a204eec3a36858dc011de9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0798877","wikidata_id":"Q30727435","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
