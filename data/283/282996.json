Within hours 11 ordinary police officers were called to duty to face the formidable Mount Erebus. As the police recovered the victims, an investigation team tried to uncover the mystery of how a jet could fly into a mountain in broad daylight. Did the airline have a secret it wanted to bury? This film tells the story of four New Zealand police officers who went to Antarctica as part of the police operation to recover the victims of the crash. Set in the beautiful yet hostile environment of Antarctica, this is the emotional and compelling true story of an extraordinary police operation.","popularity":0.4119,"poster_path":"/pSR3VTNYd3ywYqN3TKUT4UHULRT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47103,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rouge Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2014-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Erebus: Operation Overdue","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1636118,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tama Jarman","original_name":"Tama Jarman","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/dniPNaF8GJoBn1JYRcwqNj20qEB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Stuart Leighton","credit_id":"5760c5b8c3a3687b96000d9e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":571569,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin Wright","original_name":"Edwin Wright","popularity":0.2237,"profile_path":"/6EHuweaYVf4Gty25xVizcINgDNJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Greg Gilpin","credit_id":"5760c5d2c3a3687b96000da9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fraser Brown","original_name":"Fraser Brown","popularity":0.0753,"profile_path":"/wtDpG30wcU3pe7NXRByZyruuSrJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Bob Mitchell","credit_id":"5760c5e49251410d17000e89","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1399794,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Munro","original_name":"Andrew Munro","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/bIzqjMxNK58OIcMLo9jemsMvCJI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sgt Mark Penn","credit_id":"5760c624c3a3687b8b00106a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062461,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"DJ Stipsen","original_name":"DJ Stipsen","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/uEUUESiBMaHCbtqGl8alyZ2Qf1.jpg","credit_id":"630e81c9fad8e9007c990537","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Burger","original_name":"Peter Burger","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"630e81b65cea18007dec4453","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1853123,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carmen J.
