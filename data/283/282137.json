The artful butler suggests to the pretty  parlor-maid that she should hang the pictures from the step-ladder which he hastens to secure from an adjoining room. In the meantime the maid mysteriously proceeds to hang the pictures herself by walking up the side of the wall, and after accomplishing this strange feat turns a somersault from the wall into a chair.","popularity":0.0509,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1902-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ingenious Soubrette","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Picture Hanging Extraordinary","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ferdinand Zecca","original_name":"Ferdinand Zecca","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":"/dKHqFZMWex83ZEqmiRmAnXQlSK9.jpg","credit_id":"53c5ce860e0a267ffb000aaa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0426227","wikidata_id":"Q21009164","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1902-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
