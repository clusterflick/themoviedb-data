In them, he expressed admiration for a pantheon of American directors working within the studio system, including Alfred Hitchcock, Nicholas Ray and Douglas Sirk. An indication of his enthusiasm for Hitchcock was his reputation for conducting tours for visiting friends, associates, and filmmakers of the locations around San Francisco used by Hitchcock while filming Vertigo (1958), and for signing his reviews under the pen-name Scotty Ferguson, the so-named protagonist of this renowned film. In 1986, Sonbert gave a lecture at the Pacific Film Archive, in which he spoke of the \"schizophrenic split\" in Marnie between \"images of /en/closure and escape\", representing the interplay between male domination and female independence. Sonbert paralleled these conceits in his own film, A Woman's Touch. -- Jon Gartenberg","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/oxg7wVKoGzqMECNVmci0uw6liGM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Woman's Touch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Warren Sonbert","original_name":"Warren Sonbert","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/oA5YDxK96I8WAy1gOso4wqS8KTs.jpg","credit_id":"53c996840e0a261ef500022e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0379031","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":965,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oxg7wVKoGzqMECNVmci0uw6liGM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":643}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
