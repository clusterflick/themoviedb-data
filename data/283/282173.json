His possessions, which had been sold as material properties, had been purchased by Stamply, a farmer. The latter restores them to the Marquis, who decides to allocate old Stamply with the use of a corner of his manor. Hélène de la Seiglière, the Marquis's daughter, takes care of the old man. But this one, devastated by death of his son, buried under the ice of the Berezina, dies. Some time later, three persons come to live in the manor: M. de Paubert, his son Raoul, and Destournelles, a crafty, ruthlessly ambitious lawyer. De Paubert hopes to marry his son to Hélène de la Seiglière and might well achieve his aim but for the unexpected return of Bernard Stamply, who has escaped death miraculously. He gets to know Helène and the two young people fall in love with each other.","popularity":0.0607,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1921-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mademoiselle de La Seiglière","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Huguette Duflos","original_name":"Huguette Duflos","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/int0sejL49rfLSN5ZGGKv7xounb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Hélène de la Seiglière","credit_id":"53c61e88c3a3686251001b17","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":277503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Fonteney","original_name":"Catherine Fonteney","popularity":0.102,"profile_path":"/8Kug9poJiIDMUwxHZNs00h1LbtT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"La baronne de Vaubert","credit_id":"53c61ebfc3a368624b001abd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Félix Huguenet","original_name":"Félix Huguenet","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/9NFFh3Zk1EGXgmpLmDFzEY6jP74.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Le marquis de la Seiglière","credit_id":"53c61ed0c3a3686255001a8f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Granval","original_name":"Charles Granval","popularity":0.1762,"profile_path":"/b5iofbQH591T8vFAekDqJvLdh80.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Stamply père","credit_id":"53c61ee0c3a3686266001b42","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1001258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Romuald Joubé","original_name":"Romuald Joubé","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":"/1htDwwEF7CIYu7RQAynVwJPZfML.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Bernard Stamply fils","credit_id":"53c61ef1c3a368624b001abf","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Antoine","original_name":"André Antoine","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/prnPdOOLUhNqSyTEZLZzDDqG6zU.jpg","credit_id":"53c61e26c3a3686255001a87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588702,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Antoine","original_name":"André Antoine","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/prnPdOOLUhNqSyTEZLZzDDqG6zU.jpg","credit_id":"53c61e2dc3a3686260001be9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342218,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jules Sandeau","original_name":"Jules Sandeau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53c61e3bc3a3686260001bee","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Denola","original_name":"Georges Denola","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53c61e77c3a3686266001b3d","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342219,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"René Guichard","original_name":"René Guichard","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5512bacbc3a36801bb003798","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10349,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Léonce-Henri Burel","original_name":"Léonce-Henri Burel","popularity":0.0798,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5512d344c3a36861950015df","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093179,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"René Gaveau","original_name":"René Gaveau","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5512d34d925141046200001b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0142635","wikidata_id":"Q3275956","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1921-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
