After all, like Michael Ringier, CEO of the Ringier media group, says, blithely ignoring all minorities, we're very close in culture and language. Oskar Freysinger takes out his guitar and sings his answer. Politicians from French-speaking Switzerland and Ticino think expanding will help the country survive. The former German foreign minister thinks the two countries' traditions are too different. The banker Oswald Grübel is worried about Germany's debts, although he'd be prepared to take over its assets. With serious interviews interspersed with gags (boat people on Lake Constance, the last Habsburger as a peasant), Giaccobbo gathers off-the-cuff reactions which reveal a lot about the different mentalities. The movie laughs at preconceived notions, redefines neutrality and reflects on what designates a nation. Switzerland, which loves to teach the world a lesson, will soon helvetize the planet, oder?","popularity":0.4767,"poster_path":"/2stJZNeUyjpkmkPdztKp3gi6Ipo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8138,"logo_path":"/4P6c8TiJZhL2z7b0LbPOUTZwP4z.png","name":"Vega Film","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2013-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What if Germany joined Switzerland as the 27th canton?","title":"Der grosse Kanton","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der große Kanton","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Giacobbo","original_name":"Viktor Giacobbo","popularity":0.1152,"profile_path":"/apOZqrYOv1rCjwGGjnJQjx4402L.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"55490a71c3a36841b900014a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Müller","original_name":"Mike Müller","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/n0GeP5iYYS6dVUnVdCrstCWoBOY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Frank A.
