They are both attracted to the historic figure of Pancho Villa: he admires his power while she admires his virility. As Gina helps Adrian to write a book about Villa, she discovers the similarity between Villa's relation to women to that of Adrian and hers, and that Villa's revolution never included her, nor the rest of the female half of the human species. Can the love of a woman and a man survive
