One day Chim, the son of the village chief has returned home after leaving the village for years. Chim used to be Plabprueng's childhood boyfriend and she has an affair with him. When Khom finds out, he kills them both and flees the village with the children. In the forest he finds a house occupied by a mother and daughter who are actually demons who can change into tigers. Unaware of this fact, he decides to settle down and make the tiger daughter his new wife.
