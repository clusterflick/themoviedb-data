Situations that can impede digestion include receiving bad news resulting in stress, being in love, and feeling scared. Snacking or nibbling between meals can ruins one's appetite at meal time. Having the correct posture while eating is important for digestion; finding the right posture can be difficult in certain circumstances, such as being on a picnic or eating in bed (specifically for men when using trays). Sharing tables with staring strangers may also impede digestion. And it's difficult to digest food when one can't get any of it.","popularity":0.2729,"poster_path":"/eJbpueNYa1KupNFBnrgwAKUh2Di.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Eat","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Benchley","original_name":"Robert Benchley","popularity":0.1837,"profile_path":"/qXJtEUZW459w8hKEcvo4FauhOBy.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Lecturer / Joe Doakes","credit_id":"53cca6bf0e0a265e01003365","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":179451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Lee","original_name":"Ruth Lee","popularity":0.7781,"profile_path":"/bBjnYCY9bJdlt4pT3uwLkxyYuyS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mrs. Joe Doakes","credit_id":"54b0387ec3a368094a00029c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Lessey","original_name":"George Lessey","popularity":0.0951,"profile_path":"/5OFMGdV6Ayp2QyG1me5J8yvxdXq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Toastmaster at Dinner","credit_id":"54b0388992514174720002cc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Forbes Murray","original_name":"Forbes Murray","popularity":0.2591,"profile_path":"/twfHU2COpK8F40toerX502dywIb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Joe's Dinner Guest","credit_id":"54b03894c3a3680940000353","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roy Rowland","original_name":"Roy Rowland","popularity":0.3619,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54b0386a925141746c0002c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0031451","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xXqPx1OqXC2CPJLXyNwKOMY0BJn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eJbpueNYa1KupNFBnrgwAKUh2Di.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UM","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1939-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
