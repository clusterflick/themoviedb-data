But her room is occupied. Her mother, Trixi, has rented it out. Zach lives there now, a twenty-something from New Zealand, who came to Germany on a one-way ticket.

And in the end a crash, the film itself: ‘for nothing’?","popularity":0.0989,"poster_path":"/rH6aiw6wGGFheW9hCWXS3tc0I56.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Nothing","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":544813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ceci Chuh","original_name":"Ceci Chuh","popularity":0.287,"profile_path":"/d5POc98Q3JOPTGjOdJo7ZF9PTeZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Aziza","credit_id":"53c6e8360e0a267ffb002a87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1139019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Bartsch","original_name":"Vivian Bartsch","popularity":0.2199,"profile_path":"/j69u1akWR6ZbOm9XAdvm00C51so.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"mother","credit_id":"53c6e85a0e0a267fea002aaf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1671367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elliott McKee","original_name":"Elliott McKee","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"57c29aec9251410f2700001f","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1076789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Imri Kahn","original_name":"Imri Kahn","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"57c29b70c3a36847110031d0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascale Schiller","original_name":"Pascale Schiller","popularity":0.1196,"profile_path":"/yqpnOitFYOJgDs4jCXKbgCZuOX9.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"57c29b7b9251413a87002f5f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1432927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seyneb Saleh","original_name":"Seyneb Saleh","popularity":0.2129,"profile_path":"/5a4ifsjXcyq42LlHJPdEH7KPAH5.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"57c29b84c3a3680b6f0051cc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1671369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dilara Ilci","original_name":"Dilara Ilci","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"57c29b9f9251410d14004904","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1342432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephan Geene","original_name":"Stephan Geene","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53c6e7600e0a267fed002a98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1671366,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Claude Grasz","original_name":"Claude Grasz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c29ac9c3a368533100f4f2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1046655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volker Sattel","original_name":"Volker Sattel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c29a939251413a87002ed6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":568127,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bettina Blickwede","original_name":"Bettina Blickwede","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c29ab89251410f04000003","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1342432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephan Geene","original_name":"Stephan Geene","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c29a88c3a368533100f4af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1671365,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Thilo Schmidt","original_name":"Thilo Schmidt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57c29aa89251410d14004883","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3485702","wikidata_id":"Q75320593","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1063,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rBp2VTRRHvEuW9JI6FC50ixLNOL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1890}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rH6aiw6wGGFheW9hCWXS3tc0I56.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":848}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
