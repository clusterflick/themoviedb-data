Our favorite mutinous miscreant returns with her weapon of choice, “pulling the strings” as she baits greedy bystanders to snatch at the tempting objects that ever elude their grasps. Léontine is an evil puppet-master who preys on consumer capitalism’s vicious loop between wanting and having. Her angry victims form a vengeful mob and chase after her, but she trips them with string and then rides off into the woods. Real violence is averted by a clever substitution trick and Léontine celebrates with her iconic victory dance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/7shxW1ojpPTicxwD94sNb3SBhzj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1910-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Léontine Pulls the Strings","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Betty is Still At Her Old Tricks","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Betty and the Ball of String","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Betty en het kluwen touw","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1802799","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/7shxW1ojpPTicxwD94sNb3SBhzj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1999},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2998,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/lGjie8WPpewdYr7vrvl2a2ANISj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1999},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/kFYsAUngJoNVDm8OsfPFMyV0cRJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/pbCX58Jk8ckTXPFyKXe38XBlFj8.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1910-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Les Ficelles de Léontine (1910) Pathé","key":"sOZajJTP1r4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-11-10T04:56:11.000Z","id":"67b6c0ede484fc215419f2ef"}]}}}
