They stop to fill the camel with water and freshen up a bit; Olive muses aloud that she'd like to kiss a sheik. A sheik, looking a lot like Bluto, happens to overhear this and sets up a kissing booth. He carries her away to his luxurious tent. Popeye finally finishes up and notices Olive is gone; he chases after her, but his camel suffers a blowout. Meanwhile, the sheik has been wooing Olive. Popeye arrives, and after briefly sharing the hookah with the sheik, tries to leave with Olive. The sheik will have none of it; he wraps Popeye like a mummy and fires him with a cannon into the sphinx. Fortuitously, there's a can of spinach inside, and Popeye saves the day.","popularity":0.368,"poster_path":"/qYOI9usBXFs89cjN6N97G5jTBRI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Wolf in Sheik's Clothing","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Popeye (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"65b630ae2faf4d0163dcf5ee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Questel","original_name":"Mae Questel","popularity":0.415,"profile_path":"/jJ9U8K3yp09u81JG1n1wiViXqvX.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Olive Oyl (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"65b630c3b1131f018d2a5398","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Beck","original_name":"Jackson Beck","popularity":0.2105,"profile_path":"/3roBQ7ank7nAp4jQwR1kY06PoTM.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Sheik (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"65b630db60c51d00c9d0844c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Izzy Sparber","original_name":"Izzy Sparber","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e67c3a36847f828e47b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315013,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Thomas Johnson","original_name":"Thomas Johnson","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641529630d5d8500ba0ed113","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3940386,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tom Ford","original_name":"Tom Ford","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64152949e9c0dc00ecc8b066","department":"Crew","job":"Scenic Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208204,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Isadore Klein","original_name":"Isadore Klein","popularity":0.093,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641529346a2227010c4b2b94","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":160010,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Larry Riley","original_name":"Larry Riley","popularity":0.1318,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415292a6a22270085ef58ad","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Winston Sharples","original_name":"Winston Sharples","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641529505690b500d4007670","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1147011,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Rufle","original_name":"George Rufle","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641529823103250101503888","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0153888","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":818,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vTDH364g9PnCrvJBdgNYiHqNRDj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1453}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qYOI9usBXFs89cjN6N97G5jTBRI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/tqQXp8mGmlYpM3U6gHCaDb18MEQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1948-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
