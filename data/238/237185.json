He stares out the window seeing children playing and a well-dressed man sitting on a chair in the middle of the street reading a newspaper and looking up at him. A headline describes the murder of a child. The disheveled man, whose face expresses fear and despair, leaves, going through the city, alarmed when anyone looks at him. A woman invites him to look through a public telescope. He does then keeps going. He climbs a hill. Two fencers appear; so does a jester. Is flight fruitless?","popularity":0.2038,"poster_path":"/29IDbga8dQuWzqi2xPVJrRXGMyg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1947-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House of Cards","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crane Whitley","original_name":"Crane Whitley","popularity":0.0989,"profile_path":"/sr7w4pz19imDbkJRphnxL3epfYF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e66c3a36847f828e191","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1271864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gail Roberts","original_name":"Gail Roberts","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e66c3a36847f828e195","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1034937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harriette Ann Gray","original_name":"Harriette Ann Gray","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e66c3a36847f828e199","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1271863,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Vogel","original_name":"Joseph Vogel","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e66c3a36847f828e18d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1440188","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":772,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bpUoXjY30H0mjiCZuWj3jZFMsId.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/29IDbga8dQuWzqi2xPVJrRXGMyg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"The San Francisco Museum of Art","release_date":"1947-10-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
