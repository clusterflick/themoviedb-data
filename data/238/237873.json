The latter is obliged to defecate in a series of unlikely places, to the evident disgust of members of the Parisian public.  The status of this film is rather unusual, since it's not listed in the Pathé catalogues and never appeared in the French press of the time, but a surviving copy is preserved under the German title 'Der Kleine Schlaumeier'. It should not be confused with Gaumont's version \"C’est papa qui prend la purge\" by Louis Feuillade.","popularity":0.1497,"poster_path":"/2DgsI6lgd6oQrgkmFn7eh7epdQa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1907-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"C'est Papa qui a pris la purge","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Kleine Schlaumeier","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Linder","original_name":"Max Linder","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/b3PKyHuw6OyOATZeyOPJkC000mY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Man on park bench","credit_id":"52fe4e72c3a36847f82908ed","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0208027","wikidata_id":"Q2930331","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2DgsI6lgd6oQrgkmFn7eh7epdQa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1907-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
