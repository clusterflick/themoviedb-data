In this crudely rendered home video of a commune of stoned revolutionaries, the cameras are hand-held, the edits in-camera, and the dialogue is wryly on-target. Pettibon's band of outsiders reenacts a countercultural moment defined by rock music, drugs, and ideological paradox â€” and in so doing, captures their own late-80's West Coast grunge milieu as well.","popularity":1.0279,"poster_path":"/9zfiu6nluVwA71Y0x0lrNBNKAik.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Whole World is Watching","title":"Weatherman '69","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Gordon","original_name":"Kim Gordon","popularity":0.3585,"profile_path":"/QxhtVBFDKFVn6loMj9a1AqNmUv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bernadine Dohrn","credit_id":"52fe4e6bc3a36847f828ee1d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thurston Moore","original_name":"Thurston Moore","popularity":0.2069,"profile_path":"/5MFuvfhH1S0X6lTrJxq3QywG0Dn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jeff Jones","credit_id":"52fe4e6bc3a36847f828ee21","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Watt","original_name":"Mike Watt","popularity":0.2733,"profile_path":"/nUjaItfJaJQmOvRj2YI8j0IuZEm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gabe Nemisch","credit_id":"52fe4e6bc3a36847f828ee25","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1271971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abby Travis","original_name":"Abby Travis","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jane Fonda","credit_id":"52fe4e6bc3a36847f828ee29","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1336228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Cole","original_name":"Joe Cole","popularity":0.0982,"profile_path":"/ey6tL54KNw4AjzFkryCTryfe5ed.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"53b2a64fc3a3682eea00790f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":101811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Markey","original_name":"David Markey","popularity":0.3507,"profile_path":"/3rrt6IbT6x1tb3jIZbB090c3RZZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Allen Ginsberg/Yoko Ono","credit_id":"53b2a6d9c3a3682ed8007651","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raymond Pettibon","original_name":"Raymond Pettibon","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Serge Soulberg","credit_id":"53b2a6f6c3a3682ef1007798","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":66299,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Balhatchet","original_name":"Bob Balhatchet","popularity":0.1695,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"El Kahane","credit_id":"650e6779e1faed011d5d7a39","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1712684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Davo Claassen","original_name":"Davo Claassen","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Wayne Kahane","credit_id":"680615f9276bf64e41aac26d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5385571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel V.
