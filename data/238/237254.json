Olive almost ends up in the dinosaur, but the caveman (longing for a woman) saves her. Olive falls for him, but Popeye, noticing Olive's absence, comes down and saves her from the caveman. They fight it out; the caveman stuffs Popeye into a not-quite-empty spinach can and feeds him to the dinosaur, but of course, Popeye breaks out and wins the day.","popularity":0.5826,"poster_path":"/txrlymP8H6v1GwGZizkH03et8AK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pre-Hysterical Man","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Popeye / Caveman (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f7784f2f8e982003a6f2c2e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Questel","original_name":"Mae Questel","popularity":0.415,"profile_path":"/jJ9U8K3yp09u81JG1n1wiViXqvX.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Olive Oyl (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f7784f9d4d50900340a2ca5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seymour Kneitel","original_name":"Seymour Kneitel","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/6HeCQ7XXSDjQbl2RN6iYrs1zjX0.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e67c3a36847f828e48f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1106720,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carl Meyer","original_name":"Carl Meyer","popularity":0.1293,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7784c1931ea10035eb4325","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","credit_id":"5f7784c83e2ec80034c851bf","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Winston Sharples","original_name":"Winston Sharples","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7784d058efd30034b53a75","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Izzy Sparber","original_name":"Izzy Sparber","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7784d721621b00353b928e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seymour Kneitel","original_name":"Seymour Kneitel","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/6HeCQ7XXSDjQbl2RN6iYrs1zjX0.jpg","credit_id":"5f7784df3e2ec80034c853c4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1579623,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sam Buchwald","original_name":"Sam Buchwald","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7784e7944a570035ca34e4","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0152056","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gxnHvLTXA39VQqbfvISCcFFGLrJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tPX3IfPMa2leTVwPSpeW0iOTE8C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/txrlymP8H6v1GwGZizkH03et8AK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/3wvwVRHMghJ6uQLCzm2xrV4TxYf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1948-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
