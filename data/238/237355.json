Bluto and Popeye are racing around the world; Bluto's got a sort of rocket plane, and Popeye's got a sad old prop model that has to be hand-started. He gets off to a bad start, as Bluto spins the prop, getting Popeye tangled up in it. This knocks him out; Olive puts him into his plane and gives him a push, and Popeye wakes up in the nick of time. Bluto stops off at the Eiffel Tower to woo a maiden; Popeye, with help from a lightning bolt, passes him. Bluto catches up again, and removes Popeye's engine. The plane crashes into the ocean, but fortunately, there's a case of spinach and a giant magnet nearby, so Popeye rebuilds the plane, using spinach cans to replace the missing pistons, and wins the race, as his spinach exhaust fries Bluto's plane.","popularity":0.4296,"poster_path":"/4OHtBEMGMSfPxhIAKdKbIEE6DzC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hot Air Aces","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Beck","original_name":"Jackson Beck","popularity":0.2105,"profile_path":"/3roBQ7ank7nAp4jQwR1kY06PoTM.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bluto (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f7786f3d4d509003208d2ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1004823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mercer","original_name":"Jack Mercer","popularity":0.5359,"profile_path":"/lCdwmzQBcgzAYOMXum6zZ4PhSrI.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Popeye (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f7786fa21621b00353b9903","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Questel","original_name":"Mae Questel","popularity":0.415,"profile_path":"/jJ9U8K3yp09u81JG1n1wiViXqvX.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Olive Oyl (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"5f77870258efd30037b81424","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Izzy Sparber","original_name":"Izzy Sparber","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e69c3a36847f828ead1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Winston Sharples","original_name":"Winston Sharples","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7786d6f8e982003a6f2f2b","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seymour Kneitel","original_name":"Seymour Kneitel","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/6HeCQ7XXSDjQbl2RN6iYrs1zjX0.jpg","credit_id":"5f7786e37b7b4d00386b213a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1048527,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Izzy Sparber","original_name":"Izzy Sparber","popularity":0.101,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7786dd9a64350039ab13d6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1579623,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sam Buchwald","original_name":"Sam Buchwald","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7786ea3429ff0039ae9566","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208204,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Isadore Klein","original_name":"Isadore Klein","popularity":0.093,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7786ce21621b0036304ba9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0150956","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4OHtBEMGMSfPxhIAKdKbIEE6DzC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fy","file_path":"/b5SX8dLfGl41acFkrQK37KQb9cN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/uhpuCgCX08I9RznQ8BSjfu1JmZk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1949-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
