His sole hat is eaten by moths so he goes to Wally Walrus' hat store to purchase a new one (and, for once, does not give Wally a hard time). After a few attempts to get the hat to fit Woody's head, he buys the hat but it blows away landing on a goose in a meadow. After tussling with the goose, he gets his head back but loses his job at the studio anyway.","popularity":0.0586,"poster_path":"/k4qI7j5QMv9HPuRIxboeYOCVP2T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1948-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mad Hatter","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150768,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Dick Lundy","original_name":"Dick Lundy","popularity":0.1603,"profile_path":"/1ZOtBI746xrJErPiqUf2JFVUxu6.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e65c3a36847f828df33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151427","wikidata_id":"Q7749318","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AvHb3zYemqVYMDzbwNBqtrzfRO6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/k4qI7j5QMv9HPuRIxboeYOCVP2T.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3qSCuR8KzXDRtFocFLiGnlWpCCj.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/lKRJsSO6hnYNLtttFoBY1WNxTPO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1948-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
