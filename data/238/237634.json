Selecting the best one, she presents it to her favorite boarder, Billy, who does not think much of it and who gets very indignant when it is compared with the photo of his sweetheart. Miss Ophelia goes up to her room in tears and tells her faithful maid, Belinda, that her heart is broken. Belinda goes down and forcibly tells Billy what she thinks of him. Miss Ophelia resolves on suicide, because no one seems to love her. Belinda gets back in time to prevent this and, to divert her mistress, she suggests that they go together to a beauty specialist. Arriving there, both receive attention. Miss Ophelia gets a new complexion, while Belinda gets new teeth. Both invest in new gowns and dresses and the transformation is complete. At supper time, the boarders are all astounded.","popularity":0.4615,"poster_path":"/nPhNxi8lKR7qoVyPD0u6CrmzqQL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Lady and Her Maid","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norma Talmadge","original_name":"Norma Talmadge","popularity":0.1066,"profile_path":"/h8ES1kk8EEByz34sKaWMDyB6Ntv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Belinda","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f5fb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Florence Radinoff","original_name":"Florence Radinoff","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":"/39kPWzv7mYLKTZNMlDzjqaq3ZqR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Miss Ophelia Sweet","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f5ff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Morrison","original_name":"James Morrison","popularity":0.1369,"profile_path":"/74FZiGds3xQqRB7Ee0WJLqMzee1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Billy","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f603","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Walker","original_name":"Lillian Walker","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":"/tr17rGWaHdq5iWJFMh9vosynoG4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Billy's Sweetheart","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f607","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hughie Mack","original_name":"Hughie Mack","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":"/qSIspcIVazqgoYY38cjaguQRvDK.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f60b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Price","original_name":"Kate Price","popularity":0.1337,"profile_path":"/auh0gxFdHdeT08W9zEv9VQMYa95.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f60f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":998697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flora Finch","original_name":"Flora Finch","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":"/r1Af5GrRy6uKDRwsWTxrsitpmIy.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f613","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Angeles","original_name":"Bert Angeles","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f5f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0336723","wikidata_id":"Q3602533","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nPhNxi8lKR7qoVyPD0u6CrmzqQL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9748,"name":"revenge"},{"id":34130,"name":"makeover"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
