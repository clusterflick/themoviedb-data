Johnny comes home as coffin bearer and after the ceremony at the Eindhoven Airbase, he is being welcomed home in the bar of his parents who treat him as a hero. Johnny undergoes the welcome party passively. He doesn't feel comfortable or at home. The next day he drives with a loaded gift to Aerdenhout. The gift is a DVD containing a movie that Diederick had made for his twin sister's birthday, Fleur. He rings the bell at the ancestral home of Diederick. The loss of Diederick has put the family relations on edge. Because of his gift, Johnny is sucked into the unpredictable family struggling with their pain. Johnny sees it as his duty to help them, but he doesn't know how. To be able to come home, he must first allow himself to experience his own grief.","popularity":0.1713,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Met donker thuis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anneke Blok","original_name":"Anneke Blok","popularity":0.1231,"profile_path":"/pYoIwlJwMxpYeBhI38yMnztKgym.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Carolien","credit_id":"52fe4e72c3a36847f82907f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert de Hoog","original_name":"Robert de Hoog","popularity":0.2739,"profile_path":"/5EyBuILpK61Krxiaq4GkeMNTWlU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Johnny","credit_id":"52fe4e72c3a36847f82907fd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":234235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaite Jansen","original_name":"Gaite Jansen","popularity":1.1944,"profile_path":"/9qv1Ocy9I1FLXVo3UeJqBzfu58V.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Fleur","credit_id":"52fe4e72c3a36847f8290801","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gijs Scholten van Aschat","original_name":"Gijs Scholten van Aschat","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/w36EJOfFBZvjXvpurXuZ3CA5NQa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Andries","credit_id":"52fe4e72c3a36847f8290805","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267108,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jaap-Peter Enderle","original_name":"Jaap-Peter Enderle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e72c3a36847f82907f5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joeri Holsheimer","original_name":"Joeri Holsheimer","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e72c3a36847f82907ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2011128","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
