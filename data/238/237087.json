A smarter dog suggests getting the cat to come to him instead; the dog mounts a parade proclaiming \"Be Kind to Cats Week\" and encouraging the cat to shake hands with the nearest dog. He does; the dog has a mallet behind his back, but the cat has an endless array of protective hats. The dog then tries a marionette of an attractive female cat to lure the cat to some doors propped up in the woods; again, the cat eludes the dog. Eventually, the smart dog reappears, revealing himself as the cat in a dog costume.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/1KLzXkuIXLhFgNEYrXJQvQWzs8z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1947-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up N' Atom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1054825,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sid Marcus","original_name":"Sid Marcus","popularity":0.1236,"profile_path":"/bMPvXnD5uehHE4QH7CUOrQlxl76.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e65c3a36847f828de0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0162727","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1KLzXkuIXLhFgNEYrXJQvQWzs8z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1947-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
