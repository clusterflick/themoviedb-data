What a coincidence... at that moment, there is only one grape left. Both try to pretend they don't want it but each secretly tries to make off with the last grape first. They try using a fishing rod only to hook each other. The crow sneaks across in a pair of underwear but is discovered by the fox. The crow tries sleepwalking but is again discovered. After feuding with each other through the phone, they attack each other and a free-for-all ensues. Finally, the crow decides this sparring isn't worth it and insists the fox can have the last grape. The fox, now equally courteous, offers it to the crow who doesn't want it. At this point, the feuding begins anew.","popularity":0.9926,"poster_path":"/58E1wHFPBjAN8ogremEpxBenHhf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grape Nutty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1238851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Barry","original_name":"Dave Barry","popularity":0.141,"profile_path":"/sjBsu8FAne6NIJ77h1LLYqTWgYg.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Crow (voice)","credit_id":"63e5501990fca3007b053574","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":785866,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cal Howard","original_name":"Cal Howard","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Fox (voice)","credit_id":"6123e6d1fcf907005d666779","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Wright","original_name":"Will Wright","popularity":0.9956,"profile_path":"/sv7ays7e47x6KEw4VFPhfxofazD.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Crow (Voice)","credit_id":"63e54eba2e2b2c00a8b9c9b9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558639,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Lovy","original_name":"Alex Lovy","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/txGj5oXMl7rVvHwDQsOeichoFIH.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e69c3a36847f828e807","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2579783,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Jay Sarbry","original_name":"Jay Sarbry","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60401a51d8e15a0027ab7ead","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1114175,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Henry Binder","original_name":"Henry Binder","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60401a0768929c002b1a93ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2997576,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Al Boggs","original_name":"Al Boggs","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60401a2e60620a0076cac1a8","department":"Art","job":"Background Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":452840,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Sommer","original_name":"Paul Sommer","popularity":0.2796,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60401a5b53f833006f5c9ad6","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980524,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dave Monahan","original_name":"Dave Monahan","popularity":0.2101,"profile_path":"/vjnwtC0HLtYSKsjJR0OWEzfmhNg.jpg","credit_id":"604019fc53f833005a59cffe","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1482114,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Chic Otterstrom","original_name":"Chic Otterstrom","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60401a44dcb6a30045f6ae85","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":111193,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Darrell Calker","original_name":"Darrell Calker","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60401a20ec187900445ef6be","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":785866,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cal Howard","original_name":"Cal Howard","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604019efdcb6a3006e3e59a3","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1258781,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Raymond Katz","original_name":"Raymond Katz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60401a11c5c1ef006eb4ef0b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":222315,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jim Carmichael","original_name":"Jim Carmichael","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60401a3c1d6c5f00458bfa3c","department":"Directing","job":"Layout"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0148235","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/esiJUWkhnGRs3dXREvpO1ZGqJJR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/58E1wHFPBjAN8ogremEpxBenHhf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2527,"name":"fox"},{"id":4639,"name":"crow"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1949-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
