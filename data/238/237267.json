Fortunately, there is a banquet going on down the street at Mrs. Van Glutton's mansion. The two arrive at the mansion and instantly try the patience of butler Wally Walrus who doesn't appreciate the food filching ways of the two. Eventually, an enormous food fight erupts with Wally caught in the middle, ending with Wally chasing the two away with a shotgun.","popularity":0.0757,"poster_path":"/vuwQTmSmU4BHxD7McMISWIHuKQu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Banquet Busters","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150768,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Dick Lundy","original_name":"Dick Lundy","popularity":0.1603,"profile_path":"/1ZOtBI746xrJErPiqUf2JFVUxu6.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e67c3a36847f828e4e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0146462","wikidata_id":"Q4857084","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":1427,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/igDni689HpAcYBOWTA50EW9dYW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2535}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1202,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vuwQTmSmU4BHxD7McMISWIHuKQu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":802},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8OhRXLl4B3fXC4IG34OG7736cKa.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/61BIVQU54Pmbf1HXKf1r0SdfbND.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1948-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
