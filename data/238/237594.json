Now we’ve come back. Perhaps it was a sense of duty, perhaps nostalgia that brought us back – who knows? Perhaps it was both. Daiga, Aldis, Osis – they’re all our people. The first film had an impact on both the filmmakers and the residents of Crossroad Street. We found friends whom we want to meet again and again. Society has become more prosperous, several value systems coexist side-by-side. People often live in these systems as though they were in different worlds that never meet. We felt that the world inhabited by our people is sinking into oblivion, and so we wanted to show that it still has its own turbulence, that Crossroad Street resembles Latvia’s palm – the place where a fortune teller can see the lines of its destiny.","popularity":0.2589,"poster_path":"/b7N5ZwfUGOoiviBksXVa2ssWJo0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122381,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eiropas dokumentālā kino simpoziji","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"1999-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Times at Crossroad Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Neue Zeiten in der Crossroad Street","type":"Regional"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Новые времена на улице Поперечной","type":"Regional"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juris Gornavs","original_name":"Juris Gornavs","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f51d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Maria Brandauer","original_name":"Klaus Maria Brandauer","popularity":0.2571,"profile_path":"/mE4polIdi4QdzDvIuHgfM37n7l9.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5e274818ed2ac200153a279c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201927,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tālivaldis Margēvičs","original_name":"Tālivaldis Margēvičs","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/ojz3lFUIcFjX8hmpJk6MZVnYy3Z.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f52f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272060,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maija Selecka","original_name":"Maija Selecka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f53b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivars Seleckis","original_name":"Ivars Seleckis","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/fTMcZgbtqfFFxUhgTTc5rwUaQ4s.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f523","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1201926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivars Seleckis","original_name":"Ivars Seleckis","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/fTMcZgbtqfFFxUhgTTc5rwUaQ4s.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f529","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188236,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivars Vigners","original_name":"Ivars Vīgners","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/3wPZrnt7KlIJJEcYa4kKgSfln07.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e6dc3a36847f828f535","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2397060,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aivars Riekstiņš","original_name":"Aivars Riekstiņš","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fef4734ecc7e8003d138594","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2399787,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leonīds Bērziņš","original_name":"Leonīds Bērziņš","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fef479585702e003e93e470","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2397061,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Baiba Urbāne","original_name":"Baiba Urbāne","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fef47abb458b8003ee37dc3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0254440","wikidata_id":"Q4326488","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b7N5ZwfUGOoiviBksXVa2ssWJo0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
