This film explores what it’s like to be awake against one’s will and the feelings of despair and loneliness that accompany the passing of time. The story is told through the protagonist’s eyes as we drift in a state between wakefulness and sleep through the city at night. The abstract and poetic imagery takes us deeper into the vicious circle of someone's struggle with sleeplessness.","popularity":0.0322,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endless Day","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Frances Ewert","original_name":"Anna Frances Ewert","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e73c3a36847f8290d7f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272346,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Isabelle Bertolone","original_name":"Isabelle Bertolone","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/r0BRDbjglzZriXGUdT9Qwo5Uw3X.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e73c3a36847f8290d67","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272348,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Lemke","original_name":"John Lemke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e73c3a36847f8290d73","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Frances Ewert","original_name":"Anna Frances Ewert","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e73c3a36847f8290d61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272347,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pius Neumaier","original_name":"Pius Neumaier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e73c3a36847f8290d6d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272348,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Lemke","original_name":"John Lemke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6403999ce61e6d00c657e5a1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2333046","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
