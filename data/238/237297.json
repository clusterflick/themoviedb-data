He targets two polite twin gophers as his first conquest and tries to kill them with a falling-rock trap hooked to a radish patch, then plots to attract them into range of his clutches by dressing himself like a baby, then by playing music. The gophers foil all of these schemes and trap the dog in his own piano as they play the keys, which are linked to hammers whacking the dog's rear.","popularity":0.3061,"poster_path":"/feUBqc46itGWT1SrUO7NDA49ASE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8298,"logo_path":"/r6cuEYq7DqrHCNVa7vSanTS0cuw.png","name":"Warner Bros.
