Wealthy but unsatisfied former thespian James (Jack Lemmon) lives with his morphine-addict wife, Mary (Bethel Leslie), and their two tormented sons, Jamie (Kevin Spacey) and Edmund (Peter Gallagher). As nightfall approaches, truth and madness fight for control over a family tearing itself apart. A landmark production from theater legend Jonathan Miller, this searing drama is a bold, electrifying powerhouse you'll never forget. (Lemmon was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in Mini-Series or Made-for-TV Movie the following year.)","popularity":1.1399,"poster_path":"/sDx4WuEg1A3jxqUJNhVvp9hwlZi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Day's Journey Into Night","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Dluga podróz w mrok nocy","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Lemmon","original_name":"Jack Lemmon","popularity":0.975,"profile_path":"/7jWVWLr1VJqQrN3d4YJaATCIHRw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"James Tyrone","credit_id":"52fe4e6cc3a36847f828f31b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":153694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bethel Leslie","original_name":"Bethel Leslie","popularity":0.4029,"profile_path":"/779HRFd1sk7x1aKvfZtiYmmKKEi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mary Tyrone","credit_id":"52fe4e6cc3a36847f828f31f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Gallagher","original_name":"Peter Gallagher","popularity":1.3253,"profile_path":"/4uHl6d9dmeeFygByOoHaD5BLR0W.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Edmund Tyrone","credit_id":"53bc6619c3a3684ce3000118","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Spacey","original_name":"Kevin Spacey","popularity":1.8558,"profile_path":"/nPrUZDEbGQe6jwpVbHKJCXsMd7r.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"James 'Jamie' Tyrone Jr.","credit_id":"53bc6620c3a3684cf400012a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jodie Lynne McClintock","original_name":"Jodie Lynne McClintock","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/xJwCLwn1q7stn0tgojASYSXJ421.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Cathleen","credit_id":"53bc6632c3a3684ce300011c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126544,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eugene O'Neill","original_name":"Eugene O'Neill","popularity":0.1462,"profile_path":"/cnXgZUovJMeHAsqzXtScprfnV19.jpg","credit_id":"62660ed12cff18006677ca2f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126544,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eugene O'Neill","original_name":"Eugene O'Neill","popularity":0.1462,"profile_path":"/cnXgZUovJMeHAsqzXtScprfnV19.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e6cc3a36847f828f325","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1246494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Miller","original_name":"Jonathan Miller","popularity":0.2077,"profile_path":"/jBhQSQavORk3DZzn5mDMgtxWjW3.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e6cc3a36847f828f317","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0093432","wikidata_id":"Q27252384","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mJoKv76K32d0jT6SLjdlIMl9EZS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1778}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sDx4WuEg1A3jxqUJNhVvp9hwlZi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1147},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dpDOt1LsaY36z0yGjT02xsEelNm.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":801,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vlzrhXeNkeL68350PH3l4VDF5Sw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":534}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
