Hawley, 91 and a former journalist, maintains the world's largest and most treasured archive of Himalayan mountaineering expeditions and her work is trusted by news organizations and publications around the globe. All this despite never having climbed a mountain herself.","popularity":0.2369,"poster_path":"/cjXCi67XZKjdgWBlhyiJnOxCt3X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NP","name":"Nepal"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keeper of the Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2440380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Hawley","original_name":"Elizabeth Hawley","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5db300dcd40d4c0012f75bcf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2440382,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allison Otto","original_name":"Allison Otto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db3010b4083b30013526a95","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2690248","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":930,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cjXCi67XZKjdgWBlhyiJnOxCt3X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":620}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":486,"name":"himalaya mountain range"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
