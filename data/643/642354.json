The delirious short takes place in a far future equal parts Blade Runner and Bruegel the Elder, full of tough-talking gangsters, jaw-dropping neon vistas, and enough bizarre creatures and robots to fill several Star Wars cantinas. The world-building illustrates the animatorâ€™s philosophy that movies can be as much about their setting as they are their characters.","popularity":0.0487,"poster_path":"/x7XBqkkI78eHkry7kgty1JLoKsw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goodbye Mommy","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2625835,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arca","original_name":"Arca","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/7oJ1i4N4e6DLTyJGnNiaR8aPgej.jpg","credit_id":"60d904270b5fd6005f5271e5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2440387,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Will Freudenheim","original_name":"Will Freudenheim","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db3047f25a5360013dfdcb3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2038354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Wedge","original_name":"Jack Wedge","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db3044225a5360011e0151e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/heGPhyb0HPsuBCXsmbBiY9gI8Et.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1078,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x7XBqkkI78eHkry7kgty1JLoKsw.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":808}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
