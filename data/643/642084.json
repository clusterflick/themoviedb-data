The children born on that day and at the turn of the millennium have now come of age. They have only ever known ex-KGB man Vladimir Putin at the pinnacle of power. What do this generation think and feel? Some are ardent Putin opponents, for others he is an idol. Some want to leave the country others want to fight for change. From the perspective of these millennium children, torn between private dreams and political aspirations, a nuanced portrait of the ‚Putin generation‘ emerges.","popularity":0.0616,"poster_path":"/a8CniX1x85Z3kkGnauBDe1rS1wX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79672,"logo_path":"/2SQIpshHB3FFxUsyNiYzUY3pUn.png","name":"Lichtfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Russia's Millennium Children","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1635465,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Maksim Tarasyugin","original_name":"Максим Тарасюгин","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db19147d9554b0014e1557b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1323427,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wolfgang Bergmann","original_name":"Wolfgang Bergmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db191885be00e00139647b0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2439810,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexandr Lemeshev","original_name":"Alexandr Lemeshev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db191c7d9554b0014e15741","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1160309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irene Langemann","original_name":"Irene Langemann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db19137d9554b0014e15537","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2439809,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Langemann","original_name":"Daniel Langemann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db191afcb30840011ad1c1e","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2439811,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Detlef Schmitz","original_name":"Detlef Schmitz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db19376cb30840013ad4941","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2016559,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lena Rem","original_name":"Lena Rem","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db192d65be00e0018964389","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1160309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Irene Langemann","original_name":"Irene Langemann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db1913dd9554b0014e1554e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fd798xwSmhkGhDvuySaCCifTHda.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4R1VGp75blvCCdefoCRUoMycBGo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a8CniX1x85Z3kkGnauBDe1rS1wX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cologne","release_date":"2019-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Art Doc Fest","release_date":"2019-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
