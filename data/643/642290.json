Each of her participants is an ordinary woman who in everyday life is completely unrelated to the scene. One of them is a seller in a store, someone is engaged in garbage collection, and someone does work as a loader to provide shelter and food. But all of them are united by a love of music and a hope for a brighter future. The arrival of the Italian delegation in the city becomes a real glimpse among the gray everyday life of our heroines, and their dreams at that moment seem even more illusory.","popularity":0.0646,"poster_path":"/jyi5KgGm5t3OrrdSUslUoY1SSRJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54667,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Lendoc","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2006-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kiss Me Passionately","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Tseluy menya krepche","type":"transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Kiss Me Harder","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Besame Mucho","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1994086,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sergey Maksimov","original_name":"Sergey Maksimov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db2a8ed4b0c630014ea296a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1209492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Rudnitskaya","original_name":"Alina Rudnitskaya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bUM58gaTGgvEJLKkj1vu7zQJ0K6.jpg","credit_id":"5db2a8e44b0c630014ea2958","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2104294,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vyacheslav Telnov","original_name":"Vyacheslav Telnov","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/szRQBVtVz70ZVfDRsJx3pbuWluZ.jpg","credit_id":"5db2a8f84b0c630017ea3e0f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1209492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alina Rudnitskaya","original_name":"Alina Rudnitskaya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bUM58gaTGgvEJLKkj1vu7zQJ0K6.jpg","credit_id":"5db2a8ded40d4c0018f6d544","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2440235,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Larisa Solovtsova","original_name":"Larisa Solovtsova","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db2a90d4b0c630012ea8a5c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jyi5KgGm5t3OrrdSUslUoY1SSRJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":532}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DocumentaMadrid","release_date":"2007-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Window to Europe Film Festival","release_date":"2006-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
