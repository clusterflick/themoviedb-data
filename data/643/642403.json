Listen as this great conductor produces musical nuisances that are unique to his art and how he accompanies the soloists with understanding and rapport. I have no hesitation in claiming this is one of the great recordings of the century.","popularity":0.3231,"poster_path":"/dQ6oQ2e3urhHGiAwqdDdqyloeqw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A peaceful requiem","title":"Karajan Brahms Ein Deutsches Requiem","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert von Karajan","original_name":"Herbert von Karajan","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":"/x5BINmghy56Hibqxpq9SVkPZouQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Conductor","credit_id":"5db323d9d2c0c100180ddcba","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":929016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gundula Janowitz","original_name":"Gundula Janowitz","popularity":0.1545,"profile_path":"/g8LFdzMOoMpNeCZExyLgBDsBmBr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5db323ea4b0c630017eb33e2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José van Dam","original_name":"José van Dam","popularity":0.1477,"profile_path":"/ogj5ITifaFJeg89UY4WDIu5sUTr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5db323f6d40d4c0012f7b68d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26178,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Johannes Brahms","original_name":"Johannes Brahms","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":"/6cZcrCSTaQ8DuMcvD5q5Py8EMn5.jpg","credit_id":"5db324d74b0c630017eb3599","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cZ7WBDtPRBrp2zr0F1VtVFrzhQv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dQ6oQ2e3urhHGiAwqdDdqyloeqw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":215794,"name":"requiem"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
