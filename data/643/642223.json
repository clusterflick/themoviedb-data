The principals are superb, especially the sisters. Bruscantini as Don Alfonso is past his prime, but he knows and understands the role inside out, so one does not even notice his vocal limitations. Araiza is in top form as Ferrando, and Morris makes virile Guglielmo. The only disappointment is Battle as Despina. Unlike her partners, she does not have feel for the Mozart ensemble, and her vocal mannerisms are totally unbecoming. How the producers allowed that to happen is a mystery. Muti's conducting is terrific, much better than on his La Scala video, where he is uninvolved.","popularity":0.1591,"poster_path":"/o36KwQmJQPxjPuIU9hGNLoYhgiw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19492,"logo_path":null,"name":"ArtHaus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":188,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cosi Fan Tutte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2440111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Marshall","original_name":"Margaret Marshall","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/o9ScEaxxgoG0M4BwXk5kPLlmnqy.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Fiordiligi","credit_id":"5db228ccd40d4c0012f57cc6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1557047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Murray","original_name":"Ann Murray","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dorabella","credit_id":"5db228e34083b3001350938b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":432628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Morris","original_name":"James Morris","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/1YYYRhX4X1Z8MrRgBa88dpLTm9X.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Guglielmo","credit_id":"5db229004083b300135093fb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Araiza","original_name":"Francisco Araiza","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":"/abakJ2KQVVcbXQfTDVIur3JnMZR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ferrando","credit_id":"5db229154b0c630012e9221e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1140257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Battle","original_name":"Kathleen Battle","popularity":0.1167,"profile_path":"/6v2JmMtAyAXwjAUe9k2vzGEi0ii.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Despina","credit_id":"5db229354b0c630017e92cfc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1567013,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sesto Bruscantini","original_name":"Sesto Bruscantini","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/8cr6iUlMlYBXNCpdTwnFZm3oaB6.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Don Alfonso","credit_id":"5db2294dd40d4c0014f5a177","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149342,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Riccardo Muti","original_name":"Riccardo Muti","popularity":0.1337,"profile_path":"/2vUosOkdjyE4IsmXXOYYifMQZdE.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"5db2295e4b0c630012e922ff","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1338915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Hampe","original_name":"Michael Hampe","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/rn7dnuMeZI4ZvZXjtaGDlN5e0cK.jpg","credit_id":"5db22a3025a5360011ddfcde","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":233456,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lorenzo da Ponte","original_name":"Lorenzo da Ponte","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/mM38EiXvY2Oi7cLrvXdT6j0S2aa.jpg","credit_id":"5db22a454083b30015506eb7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149342,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Riccardo Muti","original_name":"Riccardo Muti","popularity":0.1337,"profile_path":"/2vUosOkdjyE4IsmXXOYYifMQZdE.jpg","credit_id":"678ebe2b8bca661d054366e9","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"678ebe3823459b4bd86dbfd2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qNYgpDghcKApYXWNtXkMcpjmQO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/o36KwQmJQPxjPuIU9hGNLoYhgiw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
