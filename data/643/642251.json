Basing the narrative on eye-witness accounts, the artists use G.I. Joe action figures, similar to those they played with during childhood, to tell the story. The video examines a culture in which young boys are encouraged to act out such violent scenarios before they can even read. More generally, it is critical of America’s unquenchable thirst for material goods.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/288R5MejZ1RClxYJZzB9mxd2c6J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winter In America","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2440156,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kambui Olujimi","original_name":"Kambui Olujimi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db260b7d40d4c0012f60bcb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2437054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hank Willis Thomas","original_name":"Hank Willis Thomas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db25fe94083b30018512d6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/288R5MejZ1RClxYJZzB9mxd2c6J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
