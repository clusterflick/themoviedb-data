Chabrol then describes how he went on to write, with Eric Rohmer, the first book on Hitchcock, and even served as a consultant when Hitch came to Paris to direct his film TOPAZ. Several key scenes from Hitchcock movies, with a special emphasis on UNDER CAPRICORN, are discussed and dissected.","popularity":0.1582,"poster_path":"/eV0e3tLKPFZRcb0Du4NL9oNDIfK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Cinema of Signs: Claude Chabrol on Alfred Hitchcock","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19069,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude Chabrol","original_name":"Claude Chabrol","popularity":0.3612,"profile_path":"/myzAC2aVHhqLxzb7Bqo7xVtOloG.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5db24b6825a5360013de3656","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Fischer","original_name":"Robert Fischer","popularity":0.1526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db24b8ad40d4c0018f6013d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0926308","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eV0e3tLKPFZRcb0Du4NL9oNDIfK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2006-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
