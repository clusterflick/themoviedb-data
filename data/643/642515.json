His tempo choices make sense within a complete movement or entire sonata (he doesn't need to slow down dramatically for the second subject in Op.53's first movement) and he will mostly maintain a tempo with only slight fluctuations.","popularity":0.1667,"poster_path":"/nlEMHC1mDafgZK4uE69Pvocy5wu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A lovely musical and visual document","title":"Emil Gilels Recital","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2440679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emil Gilels","original_name":"Emil Gilels","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/6PDxomfk36shKYDmEKoDsiK0YNN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5db367504b0c630017ebcd59","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421886,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugo Käch","original_name":"Hugo Käch","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/kMcj686ZnROznzDawUFgoCSiduG.jpg","credit_id":"5db3686f4b0c630017ebcef1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zAfT98rL7qfoPokDIMSbge7eVRR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nlEMHC1mDafgZK4uE69Pvocy5wu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":207592,"name":"piano"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
