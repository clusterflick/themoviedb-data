The last guests, tired with attractions, are going back home. What happens to the zoo residents, which are not closely looked at, after the gates are closed? Tired animals listen to one another’s voices. Slowly, their calls fall silent deeper into the night, which drowns each cage in darkness. Before it becomes completely dark, the birds once again announce from afar the end of a long day.","popularity":0.0457,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Falls on the Menagerie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Philibert","original_name":"Nicolas Philibert","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/q7ASsK57FAHKyIWi58Iyb0h7Znp.jpg","credit_id":"63ff3e039653f600b58b8a4c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Philibert","original_name":"Nicolas Philibert","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/q7ASsK57FAHKyIWi58Iyb0h7Znp.jpg","credit_id":"63ff3c357a4ee700aaacf5da","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Philibert","original_name":"Nicolas Philibert","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/q7ASsK57FAHKyIWi58Iyb0h7Znp.jpg","credit_id":"63ff3f049653f6007c1d2eb1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41788,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicolas Philibert","original_name":"Nicolas Philibert","popularity":0.1384,"profile_path":"/q7ASsK57FAHKyIWi58Iyb0h7Znp.jpg","credit_id":"5db4abae0792e100153e9a88","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11885320","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
