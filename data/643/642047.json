Aside from formal issues, Yvonne Rainerâ€™s knotty process of thinking, her unique brand of humor, and her engaging presence are the things that were foremost in my mind as I worked on the tape. What I hope will emerge from this process is an interrogative portrait of an artist for whom I have great respect and affection.\"  --Charles Atlas","popularity":0.1516,"poster_path":"/j6qaH3Pyd1RrhXkvsh0ywTY9kGC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rainer Variations","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1078811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yvonne Rainer","original_name":"Yvonne Rainer","popularity":0.2251,"profile_path":"/2z7TncXWs7PIRQ28bSmVVtam4hp.jpg","credit_id":"5db178205be00e00189603dd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Atlas","original_name":"Charles Atlas","popularity":0.1178,"profile_path":"/dlYNDRuv0iInZxbFxvVTC7UUsbv.jpg","credit_id":"5db17812cb30840013ad1658","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j6qaH3Pyd1RrhXkvsh0ywTY9kGC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
