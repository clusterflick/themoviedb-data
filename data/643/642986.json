The search for fame elevator goes up and down and egos bust and boom. Each character is isolated in an anachronistic, film-star dressing room, left alone, subjected to sinister fittings. The golden room with the greatest striptease talent who constantly undresses yet is never naked... The film checks these beings, isolated through their hero competition, into the lonely heart hotel where they eavesdrop on one another through thin walls.","popularity":0.0482,"poster_path":"/A1DjNplULyEJa43x8oKbEaqMfH1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2007-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Part Time Heroes","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1309129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Cumming","original_name":"Stephanie Cumming","popularity":0.0897,"profile_path":"/bVjqdRX4eofkamsqcEwVPmu7jgG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5db5adc0d1857200118b76a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2442036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Schoofs","original_name":"Johnny Schoofs","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5db5af630792e10013410ee2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2460128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrika Kinn Swensson","original_name":"Ulrika Kinn Swensson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5dd105ce57d3780018d8a340","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2460129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giovanni Scarcella","original_name":"Giovanni Scarcella","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5dd105e257d3780015d8edde","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1285235,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Haring","original_name":"Chris Haring","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db5ada13faba0001934fca4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mara Mattuschka","original_name":"Mara Mattuschka","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":"/eQld5FHMgbvC6mDC2LhXOHtNEac.jpg","credit_id":"5db5adb6d1857200168b777a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1285236,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mara Mattuschka","original_name":"Mara Mattuschka","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":"/eQld5FHMgbvC6mDC2LhXOHtNEac.jpg","credit_id":"5db5ad99d2c0c1001b13ca56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2092639,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Josef Nermuth","original_name":"Josef Nermuth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db5adae3faba0001934fcdc","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1693836","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":773,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A1DjNplULyEJa43x8oKbEaqMfH1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
