The film was made in the 2005 PC game \"The Movies,\" a business simulation game that allowed users to create their own films using pre-rendered scenes and tells the story of three Moroccan immigrants in France who turn to rioting after facing different forms of discrimination. The film was made as a response to the 2005 French riots which resulted from the deaths of two young boys who were electrocuted while hiding from police in a power substation. The civil unrest called attention to racism in France and abusive policing tactics. On its release, The French Democracy sparked controversy in mainstream media both as a political statement and as an example of the then-emerging Machinima genre tackling mature, political themes.","popularity":0.5056,"poster_path":"/1vMyFRouXPTZqSxGy4C2ewhWWG4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The French Democracy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2440172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Chan","original_name":"Alex Chan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608b3f85f8aee8006d066eb6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2440172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Chan","original_name":"Alex Chan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"608b3f9066469a002b1b6689","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2440172,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Chan","original_name":"Alex Chan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5db26f0025a5360011dedf20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q7735251","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1vMyFRouXPTZqSxGy4C2ewhWWG4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rVRENg22GB4sS2E4Y1Z33hyDOlm.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254,"name":"france"},{"id":3060,"name":"race politics"},{"id":164022,"name":"machinima"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
