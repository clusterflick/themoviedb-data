Edison was born and raised in Nottingham, England. When he was fourteen years old he began to practice Buddhism. Eighteen years old he became a monk and went to Thailand where, for a decade, he spent his time in monasteries around the country. He became the first Buddhist monk in Iceland when he moved here in 1994 and founded a Buddhist sect. Five years later Robert decided to \"derobe\" and get married. After sixteen years of celibacy Robert had to deal with being \"normal\" - getting employment, paying his bills and dealing with the needs of his partner. After four years in \"the real world\" Robert travelled back to Thailand to become a monk again. Act Normal is filmed from 1994 to 2006 and is a unique exploration of one man´s twelve-year search for some kind of love.","popularity":0.081,"poster_path":"/djlCMXCVQ4vUacMKdrrcEUnSZTh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Act Normal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3928857,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jenny Westergard","original_name":"Jenny Westergard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffcf35278d8a00ba512b17","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3050428,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Úlfur Grönvold","original_name":"Úlfur Grönvold","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffcf51278d8a00802c09af","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":936635,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Linda Stefansdottir","original_name":"Linda Stefansdottir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffcfc49653f600853d3d1c","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944832,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Sveinn Thorarensen","original_name":"Sveinn Thorarensen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffcfdf9f1be700e677ce0a","department":"Art","job":"Prop Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1308848,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Barði Jóhannsson","original_name":"Barði Jóhannsson","popularity":0.0667,"profile_path":"/7T1Ne2yCECVmd5lsUwS0LvEFkJu.jpg","credit_id":"63ffcef5278d8a007a1240ca","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3922299,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Sólveig Birna Gísladóttir","original_name":"Sólveig Birna Gísladóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffcf969653f600817f19a1","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup & Hair"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3786865,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Benedikt Jóhannesson","original_name":"Benedikt Jóhannesson","popularity":0.1484,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffcee87a4ee700b9177168","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olaf de Fleur Johannesson","original_name":"Olaf de Fleur Johannesson","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffcf129653f600853d3cef","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944833,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jón Skuggi","original_name":"Jón Skuggi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffcfe89653f600817f19cd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944824,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tómas R.
