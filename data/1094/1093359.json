At the time, protestors had no idea what they had prevented and how many lives they had saved. Told as a political thriller, the film is a David-and-Goliath tale that will engage viewers in a you-are-there experience with insider accounts from movement leaders and Nixon officials, commentary by historians, and illustrated with dynamic archival footage.","popularity":0.1339,"poster_path":"/ycnY8GYI6z4QGU1cW4whZWuMAyT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Movement and the \"Madman\"","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1172537,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephanie Mechura Challberg","original_name":"Stephanie Mechura Challberg","popularity":0.0243,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fe94c29f1be700cd616fab","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3943554,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Blanche Chase","original_name":"Blanche Chase","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fe9510699fb7008f9b4aec","department":"Editing","job":"Archival Footage Research"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3901847,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Talbot","original_name":"Stephen Talbot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fe94b1699fb7008f9b4ad6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3901847,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Talbot","original_name":"Stephen Talbot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fe94a67a4ee700b916e4ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2859631,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julie Hwang","original_name":"Julie Hwang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fe951dc7176d009d6df28d","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2151922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Aubry","original_name":"Kim Aubry","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/xpRPSyjqCTDBckjSyN23f5XJEYq.jpg","credit_id":"63fe9532cf62cd00852f96e1","department":"Crew","job":"Post-Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3943551,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Robert Levering","original_name":"Robert Levering","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fe94d0699fb7007d8e2a5d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3943553,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Steve Ladd","original_name":"Steve Ladd","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fe94f97a4ee700a23e2309","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2TaU09xUuptdsC6cybXgqFjMKTH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ycnY8GYI6z4QGU1cW4whZWuMAyT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/trczs8jYZ3Xd8ou2W53YzjrIY8c.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1762,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2C3WFrdN1SqeFQK9LKWwGnZrZxm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1175}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS - \"American Experience\"","release_date":"2023-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
