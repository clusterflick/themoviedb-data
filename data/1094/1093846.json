The roles and economics of education change: 32 children teach one adult learner.  But during this role reversal, the focus is not on the symmetrical transfer of power, but on the establishment of a situation of fragility for all parties. It is about establishing a space where no one knows. This documentary pays attention to the moments when we name something for the first time; to the thinking behind the language; to the intrinsic politics in learning processes; to collaborative teaching methods; to misunderstandings as spaces of opportunity; to the relationship with someone who comes from another world; a kind of alien who lands in the school.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nKhbvdCgj8PeVy9wpgBNHGUR0ux.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maria va a la escuela","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","title":"Maria gaat naar school","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1898,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nKhbvdCgj8PeVy9wpgBNHGUR0ux.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1264}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
