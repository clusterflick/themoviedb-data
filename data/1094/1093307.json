The program shows how one great creative artist interacted with other giants of his era, from Lenin to Stalin, Meyerhold to Mayakovsky, Isadora Duncan to Stella Adler—and includes, in addition to the Chekhov plays, scenes from his productions of Ibsen, Gogol, Hamlet with Gordon Craig as codirector, and Molière’s Le Malade Imaginaire with Stanislavsky as Argan, among many others.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/a9Pp71Cy4aCXDntlHuPbS28SV0P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":168,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stanislavsky Century","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"O Século de Stanislávski","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4550213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Hercombe","original_name":"Peter Hercombe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65d67afe458199017c2fd9e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":956,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a9Pp71Cy4aCXDntlHuPbS28SV0P.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":644}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
