Director Thorfinnur Gudnason and his team bring to life a dramatic tale with sharply defined characters – all of them horses. Stretching the limits of the nature documentary has been Gudnason´s forte and his earlier film, Woodmouse: Life of the Run, has been shown around the world. Here he takes us into the world of horses running wild in the stark but majestic highlands of Iceland. Without humanising the animals in any way, the film tells a story full of drama and emotion, character, danger, and resolve.","popularity":0.077,"poster_path":"/lqn5M2S5yLO9191px9vHkUy2u2F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Running With the Herd","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3928972,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Magnús Magnússon","original_name":"Magnús Magnússon","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"63ff94287a4ee700b917617c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hjalti Rögnvaldsson","original_name":"Hjalti Rögnvaldsson","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"63ff942f9653f6007c1d50d6","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":136830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Þorfinnur Guðnason","original_name":"Þorfinnur Guðnason","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff94069f1be7007ca6b149","department":"Production","job":"Assistant Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061897,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jón Proppé","original_name":"Jón Proppé","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff93b39653f600b58baaa3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1104949,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kjartan Kjartansson","original_name":"Kjartan Kjartansson","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff9412cf62cd00b20e2a22","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":136830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Þorfinnur Guðnason","original_name":"Þorfinnur Guðnason","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff93ac9653f600db28b83d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1183079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ólafur Rögnvaldsson","original_name":"Ólafur Rögnvaldsson","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff93cdcf62cd00811c435b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":136830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Þorfinnur Guðnason","original_name":"Þorfinnur Guðnason","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff93e17a4ee700aaad1711","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":43528,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson","original_name":"Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff93f09653f600894ea9b3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1104950,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ingvar Lundberg","original_name":"Ingvar Lundberg","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff941dc7176d0079805e73","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3942095,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guðmundur Lýðsson","original_name":"Guðmundur Lýðsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff93f9cf62cd008530163d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1571977,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Guðmundur Bjartmarsson","original_name":"Guðmundur Bjartmarsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff93c2699fb7008f9bc4c6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":136830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Þorfinnur Guðnason","original_name":"Þorfinnur Guðnason","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff93bbc7176d009d6e6ca9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thorvardur Björgúlfsson","original_name":"Thorvardur Björgúlfsson","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff93d9699fb700e6fdba7c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2828,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lqn5M2S5yLO9191px9vHkUy2u2F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
