She tells tales of her pet rat from her home region in eastern Iceland, paints, sings in the choir, plans to stage a theatrical sketch and play the leading role. We also meet Sigurdur Olafsson, who claims to be in Paradise, and Klara Tryggvason, who gets her visits in mail and by phone; most of her children are living abroad. We visit Leifur Eiriksson, who changes making his bed into a ritual of physical exercise. Gudny has only learnt the Lord's Prayer and the Bible Stories, but she knows how to tell a good story and radiates the wisdom of the ages. \"Why can't we talks about death?\", she says. \"My grandchildren ask: Grandma, are you sure you'll be with God?\" \"Yes, quite sure\".","popularity":0.0377,"poster_path":"/a44d3JNScaxuqGuhJ7A6wguIesF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Songbirds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Þorsteinn Jónsson","original_name":"Þorsteinn Jónsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff9d10c7176d009d6e6fb9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Þorsteinn Jónsson","original_name":"Þorsteinn Jónsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff9d06699fb7007d8ea43c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Þorsteinn Jónsson","original_name":"Þorsteinn Jónsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff9d0b9653f600853d3032","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Þorsteinn Jónsson","original_name":"Þorsteinn Jónsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff9d15699fb7008f9bc856","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Þorsteinn Jónsson","original_name":"Þorsteinn Jónsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff9d01699fb7008f9bc84e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2832,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a44d3JNScaxuqGuhJ7A6wguIesF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
