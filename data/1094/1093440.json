Among these little children are five poverty stricken friends who otherwise have no one to look after them. Unlike Teja's other lot, Vijay (hero's name) and his friends believe in hard work and not beggary. While cleaning cars at a traffic signal Vijay comes across a hard-hearted incident. The incident is deeply rooted in Vijay's heart who grows up to be an auto-driver as the plot takes a 15 years leap. With the 5 friends working independently now, the title 'Apna Hath Jagannath', is truly justified.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Oriya","iso_639_1":"or","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apna Hath Jagannath","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5061702","wikidata_id":"Q56260321","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
