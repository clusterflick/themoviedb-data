They decided to do something about it. In a climate of continuous repression they were able to express artistic freedom in ways which no one would have deemed possible. Clandestine exhibitions, illegal rock-concerts and excessive partying was part of the programme. A clique around singer Jan Sputnik formed a punk-rock band called Democratic Consumption, as a way to earn money. They toured around Germany, performing shows and partied each day like it was their last.","popularity":0.1043,"poster_path":"/hGP7kR6i4RMzl0DHQY0zvmgXGZw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1410,"logo_path":null,"name":"TAG/TRAUM Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2004-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schräge Zeit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944378,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karen Lönneker","original_name":"Karen Lönneker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff8707699fb7007d8e9ca2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32413,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gerd Haag","original_name":"Gerd Haag","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff871d9f1be7008ebdb98f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1648795,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Oberle","original_name":"Paul Oberle","popularity":0.0413,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff8726cf62cd007ba76162","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184537,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ólafur Sveinsson","original_name":"Ólafur Sveinsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff86f49653f600894ea545","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1184537,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ólafur Sveinsson","original_name":"Ólafur Sveinsson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff86ef7a4ee700f0f9f1e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1856006,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Halldór Gunnarsson","original_name":"Halldór Gunnarsson","popularity":0.0976,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff86ffcf62cd009d19c21b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50113,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Stockhausen","original_name":"Simon Stockhausen","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff8714699fb70096ff8029","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0436750","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hGP7kR6i4RMzl0DHQY0zvmgXGZw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"2004-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
