The high room is completely empty and open to the public - like a showcase. The other three sides are furnished with long rows of chairs, like in a dance school. Men and women sit next to each other. Little by little they rise and all sorts of encounters ensue, some cautious and tentative, others wild and impetuous. Sometimes there is a single couple on the dance floor, sometimes the full cast of 30 dancers. Bausch created this piece with her ensemble in 1978.  \"Kontakthof\" is one of four choreographies by Pina Bausch that the director Wim Wenders recorded in full for his film \"Pina - Tanzt, tanzt, oder wir los sind\" (\"Pina - Dance, Dance, Otherwise We Are Lost\").","popularity":0.1173,"poster_path":"/vkEN2T4nXyxZ01YQJdmjBkFRsIk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kontakthof - Ein Stück von Pina Bausch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1739186,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nazareth Panadero","original_name":"Nazareth Panadero","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"63ff7e179f1be700cd61e090","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Anne Stanzak","original_name":"Julie Anne Stanzak","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"63ff7e54699fb70087748ee3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pina Bausch","original_name":"Pina Bausch","popularity":0.1556,"profile_path":"/dJUPRQzvViez5k379xjEzDtQOUg.jpg","credit_id":"63ff7ecc9f1be700aaec6958","department":"Directing","job":"Stage Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pina Bausch","original_name":"Pina Bausch","popularity":0.1556,"profile_path":"/dJUPRQzvViez5k379xjEzDtQOUg.jpg","credit_id":"63ff7df79f1be700cd61e086","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.718,"height":915,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vkEN2T4nXyxZ01YQJdmjBkFRsIk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":657},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":843,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dYFYC4RDrBPkY8z0IITeY8TNzXX.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"3sat","release_date":"2014-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
