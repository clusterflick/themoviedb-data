The fall cost Millicent her memory, but at night she dreams of her former high-society existence, while during the day she works for Gumpf as a pickpocket and later becomes a cabaret dancer. A friend of the Hawthornes sees Millicent perform, recognizes her, and reports back to Mrs. Hawthorne, who has vowed to be a devoted mother should she ever find her daughter. Finally, after the Hawthornes rescue Millicent from Kraft, the lecherous cabaret manager, an operation restores her memory, and she delights in the love of her long-lost mother.","popularity":0.3549,"poster_path":"/xLamAa2zEj6Km25x4ircRgkH8hz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52058,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Dream or Two Ago","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1127086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Miles Minter","original_name":"Mary Miles Minter","popularity":0.127,"profile_path":"/9iGZ1wyTXBHb4GRIE90dT5wP2zN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Millicent Hawthorne","credit_id":"63ff42f79f1be700aaec542f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3943997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dodo Newton","original_name":"Dodo Newton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Millicent at Age 6","credit_id":"63ff43077a4ee700b917419f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1273779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lizette Thorne","original_name":"Lizette Thorne","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/5MfYZat1Qu8N1WoCrp38GZUp8u8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Her Mother","credit_id":"63ff43169653f600db289b6a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarence Burton","original_name":"Clarence Burton","popularity":0.1573,"profile_path":"/wAyi9mSaRyMSKfclF13XeIiRZj3.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Her Father","credit_id":"63ff43287a4ee7008639bcc6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Gough","original_name":"John Gough","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":"/5KozfanmuFmVS9orO7T0gdPWkEr.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Humpy","credit_id":"63ff43369f1be700aaec5442","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1516611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orral Humphrey","original_name":"Orral Humphrey","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/7pSzCx9eeLFH2udv9f4BPS2r1NF.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Kraft","credit_id":"63ff43479f1be700aaec544b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1383226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gertrude Le Brandt","original_name":"Gertrude Le Brandt","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"63ff43527a4ee7008639bcdf","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1119764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William A.
