The Reichstag is in flames. A young Dutch unemployed man, Marinus van der Lubbe, was found alone in the building. For Hitler, it was a plot by the \"Reds\". One hundred thousand communists and sympathizers were arrested during the night and in the days that followed and locked up in the first Nazi concentration camps. In March, the Chancellor obtained full powers. On September 21, the trial opened in Leipzig, broadcast on the radio. For the Nazis and the Communists alike, van der Lubbe was the perfect scapegoat. On December 23, 1933, he was sentenced to death, while his four co-defendants were acquitted.","popularity":0.1206,"poster_path":"/kmOAj9xa9dCvnaoALSXGeHe4puo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11331,"logo_path":"/wcHhcw58wms26ejFLx1unYDT37n.png","name":"Cinétévé","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Reichstag Fire","video":false,"vote_average":7.667,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Als der Reichstag brannte","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1199345,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Renaud Barbier","original_name":"Renaud Barbier","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fdbc959f1be7008ebce293","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2415505,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mickaël Gamrasni","original_name":"Mickaël Gamrasni","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63fdbc2d9f1be700e676f02a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2415505,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mickaël Gamrasni","original_name":"Mickaël Gamrasni","popularity":0.0813,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642188c923be4600df998539","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565440,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Louis Goldschmit","original_name":"Louis Goldschmit","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642189058d22fc00cc0f71e5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26676508","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1FnP6VtzhQ4AMyKEPVAPU6fUYoS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/kmOAj9xa9dCvnaoALSXGeHe4puo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
