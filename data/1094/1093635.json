The split screen confronts statements of pedestrians and friends about the life of city memorials with a performative intervention of the artist climbing on the monuments. Memory is animated but also dismembered by an obsessive desire to inhabit and reappropriate the stony bodies of historical figures.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There Are No Monuments To Monuments","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2307592,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dana Kavelina","original_name":"Dana Kavelina","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/f4X2MmLfN4sJYxNQFvne89Em9Gh.jpg","credit_id":"63ff7cc09653f600894e9fc6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
