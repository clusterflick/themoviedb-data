The film is mainly based on interviews with 37 foreigners from 9 countries who come from the world of art, sport, business and politics. Many humorous questions and interesting topics arise when the Icelandic nation is examined through the eye of the foreigner: Do foreigners think of Reykjavík as Bangkok of the north? Are the Icelanders an isolated and inbred nation? Or rather special and like no other? Is Icelandic inventiveness fit for export? Is the \"pure and unspoiled\" nation itself environmentally friendly?","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/puYp9OjwbFXExnN6hteec0lWccc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Do You Like Iceland?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2734677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Regal","original_name":"Martin Regal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"63ffc581699fb7008774a3f6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristín Ólafsdóttir","original_name":"Kristín Ólafsdóttir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffc5539653f600853d3a6f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3061876,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rakel Garðarsdóttir","original_name":"Rakel Garðarsdóttir","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffc58e9653f600db28c4da","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944743,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Eva Hrönn Steindórsdóttir","original_name":"Eva Hrönn Steindórsdóttir","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffc5a3278d8a00ba5128cd","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79815,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bergsteinn Björgúlfsson","original_name":"Bergsteinn Björgúlfsson","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/cOoiy9L9h5sPHWwP5rfaksZ40tV.jpg","credit_id":"63ffc55b9653f600853d3a73","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristín Ólafsdóttir","original_name":"Kristín Ólafsdóttir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffc56fc7176d008188b043","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944739,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Haukur Hauksson","original_name":"Haukur Hauksson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffc5637a4ee700a23ea782","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3060872,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Birgir Tryggvason","original_name":"Birgir Tryggvason","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffc5ab278d8a00802c0703","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1725963,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kristín Ólafsdóttir","original_name":"Kristín Ólafsdóttir","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffc54c699fb7008f9bd253","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944416,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Arnar Ólafsson","original_name":"Arnar Ólafsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffc577c7176d00db597488","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944742,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elín Arnar","original_name":"Elín Arnar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffc5997a4ee700f0fa03b0","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0819897","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":896,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/puYp9OjwbFXExnN6hteec0lWccc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":635}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
