At the centre is the garrison commander Halli, who was transformed from an air-traffic controller in Reykjavik to a high ranking officer in a NATO army. The commander gave unprecedented and uncensored access to his garrison and the close to 2000 multinational troops stationed in the war torn country of Afghanistan. Through the often naïve eyes of the Icelandic men we experience the environment, both inside the camp and outside and get to know their emotions and sometimes humorous vision towards their own experience.","popularity":0.0727,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":194651,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tindra - Orðspor (IS)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chicken Commander","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1497137,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fridrik Gudmundsson","original_name":"Fridrik Gudmundsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff8d2f9653f6007c1d4ec3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1833197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristinn Hrafnsson","original_name":"Kristinn Hrafnsson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/EVlNG1GkrOW5qohPg0QfJRCl3D.jpg","credit_id":"63ff8d399f1be700e677bc53","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2734677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Regal","original_name":"Martin Regal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff8d407a4ee7008639d7f8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1497137,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fridrik Gudmundsson","original_name":"Fridrik Gudmundsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff8d4d9653f600817f0792","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944429,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Birgir Þór Bragason","original_name":"Birgir Þór Bragason","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff8d59c7176d008517084d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1497137,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fridrik Gudmundsson","original_name":"Fridrik Gudmundsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff8d629f1be7008ebdbc08","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3916109,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ásta Briem","original_name":"Ásta Briem","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff8d68699fb7007d8e9f01","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1308848,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Barði Jóhannsson","original_name":"Barði Jóhannsson","popularity":0.0667,"profile_path":"/7T1Ne2yCECVmd5lsUwS0LvEFkJu.jpg","credit_id":"63ff8d707a4ee7007c733396","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1833197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristinn Hrafnsson","original_name":"Kristinn Hrafnsson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/EVlNG1GkrOW5qohPg0QfJRCl3D.jpg","credit_id":"63ff8d7d7a4ee700f0f9f434","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944431,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sigurjón Jónsson","original_name":"Sigurjón Jónsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff8d8a699fb700c64a61a0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3060872,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Birgir Tryggvason","original_name":"Birgir Tryggvason","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff8d939f1be700cd61e7d2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944432,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Helgi Finnbogason","original_name":"Helgi Finnbogason","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff8d9c699fb7007d8e9f26","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"is","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
