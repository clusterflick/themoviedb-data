A rusting shipwreck on the rocks outside of Cabo San Lucas in 1972 provides a central and poignant metaphor for a macro-psychedelic and micro-expressionistic exploration of tropical colors and surfy forms. At the time many innovative and experimental in-camera techniques were used to create a dazzling and mysterious vocabulary of painterâ€™s eye multi-plane  cinema. Extensive abstract expressionist hand painting can also be seen in this final version. Meanwhile the shipwreck \"Inari Maru\" has disintegrated and disappeared back into the sea.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Okeanos Painted Version","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1549032,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Myron Ort","original_name":"Myron Ort","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/9VDGXrwzgkEPlRQ0pfE34oeyHUe.jpg","credit_id":"640012de229ae2009f6c93a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
