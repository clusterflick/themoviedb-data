A new kind of revolutionary music had emerged in 1976 but was receeding everywhere except in Iceland that had not yet seen punk rock.

The population was trying to spend every penny as fast as they could because of inflation. Then in 1978 The Stranglers held a concert in remote Iceland and the punk rock bomb exploded in the face of the disco freaks.","popularity":0.1821,"poster_path":"/ruUzeZtL89c1ARDDbUntMnIAdXL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193110,"logo_path":null,"name":"Markell","origin_country":"IS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2004-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"1978 - No Beer - No Internet - Endless Disco - Something was bound to happen","title":"Punk in Iceland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2071228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Örn Marino Arnarson","original_name":"Örn Marino Arnarson","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff8990699fb700c64a6027","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1666191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hálfdán Theodórsson","original_name":"Hálfdán Theodórsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff89359f1be700aaec6e5e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2071228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Örn Marino Arnarson","original_name":"Örn Marino Arnarson","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff896d9f1be7007ca6ae2e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666193,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sigurður Ingi Ásgeirsson","original_name":"Sigurður Ingi Ásgeirsson","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff893d7a4ee700b9175dfc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2683196,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valdimar Jóhannsson","original_name":"Valdimar Jóhannsson","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":"/rk9WNUg4g9gNleBMshfYJDwuZEX.jpg","credit_id":"63ff895c9f1be7008ebdba45","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1666198,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Þorkell S.
