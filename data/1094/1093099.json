What kind of images do we get of the world now that everyone is a photographer, and what does it do with how we unfold our identities? How has the internet both captured and freed us? And will Truls even dare to show this film?","popularity":0.3793,"poster_path":"/7M4EhTbTLe4mjOraCM0MJAE6Y3u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194541,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lofoten Film
