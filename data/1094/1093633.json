Preiss’s sharp editing is key in embodying Reichian techniques through film, while much of the repressed trauma informing Guagnini’s performance references a history of the dictatorship in his native Argentina in the 1970s and 80s.” –MISHKIN GALLERY","popularity":0.0791,"poster_path":"/rzawlR3xTtBGao8hTLX1eC14qwO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Discharge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1075514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Preiss","original_name":"Jeff Preiss","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/j0UngoPnMEAeE3gllnYuo1Mp18k.jpg","credit_id":"63ff7c807a4ee7008639d0d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2621671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolás Guagnini","original_name":"Nicolás Guagnini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff7c8f9653f600db28af10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rzawlR3xTtBGao8hTLX1eC14qwO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
