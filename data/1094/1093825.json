For his final chance, he goes to attend a screen-test for new and upcoming actors for a major motion picture. However, Jerry Crawford, a young movie star heartthrob, is chosen for the lead role instead.  The screen-test being for new and upcoming actors was merely a gimmick. Once Conrad learns the truth, he makes his way to the studio, enraged. Once there, he sees former top actress Amanda. Conrad lacks the acting skills and expressions required to become a star, so Amanda offers to instruct him on the secret to pulling the audience’s gaze towards him. However, Amanda has an ulterior motive - to get revenge on her lover, Jerry, who used her as a stepping stone to become a star!","popularity":0.2444,"poster_path":"/eK3Sqtq0dNmxTgZogZeI35nBGUR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Takarazuka Revue Productions","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hollywood Gossip","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3228754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sakina Ayakaze","original_name":"彩風咲奈","popularity":0.1657,"profile_path":"/6WbzQjkIQLEpwXJVoSKwEZhZgFY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Conrad Walker (Conny Waldo)","credit_id":"63ffcdf79f1be700cd61f917","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3347801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jun Hana","original_name":"潤花","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/yCPyOggYup74cSMSOHun4B3lCyr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Estella Burns (Edla Bergenqvist)","credit_id":"63ffce0d699fb700e6fdca3e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2763799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masumi Rika","original_name":"梨花ますみ","popularity":0.1482,"profile_path":"/68xv8yN6ywUO1bH5drH8iveVX8m.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Amanda Margret","credit_id":"63ffce319f1be7007ca6c055","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3386244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayanagi Shou","original_name":"彩凪翔","popularity":0.138,"profile_path":"/95OopmQEAg3KCH1DSWbgE1dgLAt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jerry Crawford","credit_id":"63ffce44278d8a007a124097","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2763800,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"You Natsumi","original_name":"You Natsumi","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Howard Aster","credit_id":"63ffce209f1be700e677cd86","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mana Haruto","original_name":"Mana Haruto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Robert Berkeley","credit_id":"63ffce717a4ee7007c734443","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiraha Reo","original_name":"Kiraha Reo","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mario Contini","credit_id":"63ffce82699fb7008f9bd4f0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3347785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ai Sumire","original_name":"Ai Sumire","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Canon Chase","credit_id":"63ffce937a4ee700b917714b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3935777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chikaze Karen","original_name":"Chikaze Karen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Selma Brown","credit_id":"63ffcea9c7176d008188b264","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3571530,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tabuchi Daisuke","original_name":"Tabuchi Daisuke","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ffd146699fb70096ff93d0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":848,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eK3Sqtq0dNmxTgZogZeI35nBGUR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220201,"name":"musical theater"},{"id":276810,"name":"takarazuka"},{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"},{"id":290639,"name":"snow troupe"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
