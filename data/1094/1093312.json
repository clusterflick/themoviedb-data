Itâ€™s as interesting for the people, buildings and vehicles as it for the abundance of flowers.  The film includes Crouch End, Muswell Hill and Hornsey Village, and has been digitised by London Screen Archives.  Visual evidence suggests that it was filmed into the 1960s, despite it's dating.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21627,"logo_path":"/wAM874kqPQoCbirbCEY3zQlz160.png","name":"Film London","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1959-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beauty in the Borough","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vN1HNXyTd0NVHJXJ7SuJXqWw25M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"London's Screen Archives  Beauty in the Borough","key":"h7LUdCxkcHk","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2017-08-14T14:11:47.000Z","id":"63fe6a34c7176d0081881505"}]}}}
