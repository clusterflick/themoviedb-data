A man sits in a desert and struggles  to reach a flask of water and other objects symbolising relief or escape. The objects remain stubbornly out of reach, but the man doesn’t give up. What is significant about this play is that Beckett captured, without the use of words, the major concerns and motifs of Waiting for Godot and Endgame.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":17774,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Cinéastes Associés","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1964-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Act Without Words","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2233019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruno Bettiol","original_name":"Bruno Bettiol","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641cf65d13a38800817e5d7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2377563,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Guido Bettiol","original_name":"Guido Bettiol","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641cf668e0ec51008154bf50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
