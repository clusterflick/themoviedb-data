They meet to collaborate on a portrait of Libro and discuss their lives from the 1980s onwards. Now, after 3 years, Sadie is ready to uncover the painting. This short documentary follows Sadie and Libro's friendship and the collaboration's surprising reveal. The portrait is a first for art, important for queer politics and sensational to see. Showing a queerer side of queer we've never seen before.","popularity":0.0784,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":113095,"logo_path":null,"name":"Violet Pictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Private View","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3976183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Libro Levi Bridgeman","original_name":"Libro Levi Bridgeman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"641c9b65b9a0bd00d7c62c7c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3976184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sadie Lee","original_name":"Sadie Lee","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"641c9b8024b3330081ff831d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2207767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Myland","original_name":"Sarah Myland","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c9adcd75bd62436f02237","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3976180,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Matthew Humphreys","original_name":"Matthew Humphreys","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c9b21142ef100837f8b23","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3976182,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Richard Hill","original_name":"Richard Hill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c9b5424b33300f61457af","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":69451,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Dunn","original_name":"Jan Dunn","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c9aedb9a0bd00fdff48ce","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3222358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Collie","original_name":"James Collie","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c9af995c0af00c5af7c59","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Dickson","original_name":"Julie Dickson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c9b0424b3330081ff82e4","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3976179,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"The McCarricks","original_name":"The McCarricks","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c9b1024b33300b880efd9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18375688","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"BFI Flare","release_date":"2023-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
