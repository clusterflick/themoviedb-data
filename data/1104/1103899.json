That's what happened with me and my wife, Irene (Angela White). She buried herself in her work, working long hours, and I know she loves me, I know she didn't know how to cope with the grief of what was happening to me. My efforts to bring us together only pushed her farther away until I got the call from the doctor. I wasn't just in remission, the cancer was gone-- it's official! We made love, it was honest, passionate love from a woman who loved me more than I could comprehend. \"If you leave, I'm going with you,\" she told me. I was overwhelmed by her love, and although I love her, I could not stay with her knowing my presence does her more harm than good. If I leave her, go back to my previous love, would it be better for her? Is it a kindness to leave my wife knowing that I could someday become sick again, and what would become of her? The answer is yes. I must leave her.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/eA7H4HNioyr4HyliiIas1vTB9VY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129315,"logo_path":"/n7Dmi4eY7QsD5JY2sXioweN5jpi.png","name":"AllHerLuv","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seasons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1535848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela White","original_name":"Angela White","popularity":198.387,"profile_path":"/gOhzO02fRqf4ZvdmOiuTKLOZB36.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"641ce06f8de0ae007b96411b","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":2304277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"La Sirena","original_name":"La Sirena","popularity":7.725,"profile_path":"/pc1NjNakx607PLGZpun8misxsL4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"641ce07a344a8e00ba3ba1ed","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1849610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giselle Palmer","original_name":"Giselle Palmer","popularity":3.966,"profile_path":"/si3VSro7uiAoi62Tcc1djNEWxzX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"641ce086344a8e009b0ac233","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1842045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Whitney Wright","original_name":"Whitney Wright","popularity":21.609,"profile_path":"/rrpgHJnZ1L3QWFlPSbrpJDXR3YZ.jpg","credit_id":"641ce093e0ec51008154ac7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9R4zXUbmbFPdroAquIjJWhwW3wG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zcQCPZ6EByFlvn1gNyDNjojDqGA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d0eaEKNJdd7flWNCNY8cvx8ry3R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hIMhL7qWIFoAwQEzXpj4vLtsW2T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cSv6xceiWigkmArMZDgg3bL4Iri.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.723,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eA7H4HNioyr4HyliiIas1vTB9VY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":542}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC-17","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
