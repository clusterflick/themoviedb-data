Known as ’rahat-ul hulkum’ in Arabic and ’lokoumi’ in Greek, ’lokum’ came to be called as ’Turkish Delight’ at the end of the 19th century, when nationalist policies were introduced, and became the breadbasket for refugees fleeing the war that would soon begin. The film tells part of the story of Syros, which was built with the labour of Greek (Rum in Turkish) refugees from Anatolia and the islands, and focuses on the forced separation of peoples who lived together for centuries.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/qhmfGV29ZuFhNY6ejXnqpg2S2wG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turkish Delight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3091593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pınar Öğrenci","original_name":"Pınar Öğrenci","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/9OUqMMblh26PRQPaJZHvRMfhMBe.jpg","credit_id":"641b0cbef9aa4700cde6819b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":768,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qhmfGV29ZuFhNY6ejXnqpg2S2wG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":537}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: https://www.stirworld.com/see-features-pinar-ogrenci-s-turkish-delight-at-colomboscope-muses-food-history-and-war","release_date":"2022-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
