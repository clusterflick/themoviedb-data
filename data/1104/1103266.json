The things he talks about are different, his memories are different. Chanoch is an Auschwitz survivor. After forty-four months in various concentration camps, he was liberated from Gunskirchen in 1945 at the age of twelve. Film material from the archive combines fragmentarily with recordings of Chanoch, a contemporary witness, and the memories of the individual ultimately become a fragment of a collective history.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/cOs0qMCgrdQqz1QZzHU3TwCkaVG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85451,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blackbox Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2023-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Boy's Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240457,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Florian Weigensamer","original_name":"Florian Weigensamer","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641ae25d142ef100f8bed0c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1738307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Krönes","original_name":"Christian Krönes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641ae253688cd0007d5f242d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050928,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christian Kermer","original_name":"Christian Kermer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad1e3d6a3448010b71c7d7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050928,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christian Kermer","original_name":"Christian Kermer","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad1e6de24b9300c6b07cc6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4156890,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Felix Sturmberger","original_name":"Felix Sturmberger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad1e85b686b900af9f7988","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240457,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Florian Weigensamer","original_name":"Florian Weigensamer","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad1e4f8a0e9b0100c45c82","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4156892,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jürgen Kloihofer","original_name":"Jürgen Kloihofer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad1e948a0e9b00e3751aa1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1738307,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Krönes","original_name":"Christian Krönes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64ad1e5c8a0e9b013afd7e10","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27134238","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"aboyslife.film","instagram_id":"aboyslife.film","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eGCvYZWdJ5lFzattFDgIicx1zfk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/cOs0qMCgrdQqz1QZzHU3TwCkaVG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
