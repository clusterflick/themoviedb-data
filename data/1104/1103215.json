She’s back to celebrate her 50th birthday, and to appear on a popular German talk show. As she wanders the streets of Berlin with her girlfriend and friend, it becomes apparent that being an artist in this city is no longer acceptable. The humming nightlife has disappeared, and the vibrant creative community pushed to the margins of society. The film is alive with tension, both sexual and otherwise. As Maven’s story unfolds on live television, we learn about her son, her politics, her heritage, and her alter-ego Rosa who champions radical self-expression and feminism. The interview is dispersed with beautiful volcanic eruptions from Maven that act as both a denunciation of the city’s leadership and a love letter to Berlin.","popularity":0.1208,"poster_path":"/zKKn3BJuCKSlfTNIziClIuOKd7b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fourth Generation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2581627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aérea Negrot","original_name":"Aérea Negrot","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Maven","credit_id":"67c474e9111cdd4ed8b4aeb2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2362583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gérsande Gigi Spelsberg","original_name":"Gérsande Gigi Spelsberg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Petra Deinhoff","credit_id":"67c475f67053b95a73b4a3d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24442,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Zillmann","original_name":"Daniel Zillmann","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":"/n23KbBwhvy2hhtRVgmmLbMaga2p.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Chad","credit_id":"67c476878ac38c7b854e3ea6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvon Jansen","original_name":"Yvon Jansen","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Gerhard","credit_id":"67c4769d49bb8758bab4964e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3067855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim-Fabian Hoffmann","original_name":"Tim-Fabian Hoffmann","popularity":0.1389,"profile_path":"/vBPHqmLNBOc97PRy5HCIkNnIK5i.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Production Assistant","credit_id":"67c476addefa42aa0f4b10cd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yony Leyser","original_name":"Yony Leyser","popularity":0.0423,"profile_path":"/8xAdGmDCesGVvT9P8DpPpW0vHGI.jpg","credit_id":"641ac431688cd000c65ac781","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zKKn3BJuCKSlfTNIziClIuOKd7b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
