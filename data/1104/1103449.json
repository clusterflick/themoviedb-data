In ‘My Lost Generation’, Tomic tells his own as well as his generation’s story by examining what a war can do to a human being. It’s a frightening project, but it’s only through filming that he can overcome his traumas. Fear, violence, scars and distrust are unavoidable premises for the identity-less director, who with his training background from the Danish Royal Academy of Fine Arts manages to communicate his experiences in a visual, raw and poetic way.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":49722,"logo_path":null,"name":"Det Danske Filmværksted","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2009-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Lost Generation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425489,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vladimir Tomić","original_name":"Vladimir Tomić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641b3fe0d75bd600d7847b80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1425489,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vladimir Tomić","original_name":"Vladimir Tomić","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641b3fe85907de00e00142a5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
