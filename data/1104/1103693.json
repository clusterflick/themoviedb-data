This film tries to answer such questions by combining documentary scenes with elements of acting and a clear dramatic arc. For one of two brothers, a forced journey to Vietnam becomes an opportunity to better understand his origins, and thus his own parents and even himself. Czech viewers get a chance to see behind the wall of uniform cultural stereotypes and breathe life-giving movement into the minority.","popularity":0.0653,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":196360,"logo_path":null,"name":"AZN kru","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2016-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mat goc","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3975586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dužan Duong","original_name":"Dužan Duong","popularity":0.0702,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"641c357f142ef100ba36820f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3975584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viet Anh Duong","original_name":"Viet Anh Duong","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/uOtR1bTQVFN3F6Pu1Fri3NhyqDr.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"641c358fd75bd6243e4f7b03","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3975583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hai Van Duong","original_name":"Hai Van Duong","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self (uncredited)","credit_id":"641c37c2142ef100837f649c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3975586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dužan Duong","original_name":"Dužan Duong","popularity":0.0702,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c2dbda3e4ba00f6e86de4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3975588,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saimon Phan","original_name":"Saimon Phan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c34daf9aa47007cad9926","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3975584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viet Anh Duong","original_name":"Viet Anh Duong","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/uOtR1bTQVFN3F6Pu1Fri3NhyqDr.jpg","credit_id":"641c353cf9aa4700e2faa08c","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3975586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dužan Duong","original_name":"Dužan Duong","popularity":0.0702,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c2dc995c0af00d4e410ab","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3975602,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Veronika Kůdelová","original_name":"Veronika Kůdelová","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c350d24b33300d725f069","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2379762,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luka Šuto","original_name":"Luka Šuto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c34ebd75bd62436eff9d9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3975586,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dužan Duong","original_name":"Dužan Duong","popularity":0.0702,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641c2de5142ef100f8bf5e82","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4155762","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jihlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2016-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
