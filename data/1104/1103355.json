This battle of political wills forms the backdrop to the military action in which Cesare and Catone are engaged in 49-48 BC and to an involved secondary love plot.  Catone in Utica was staged for the first time in 1737 in Verona and is one of the last operas by Antonio Vivaldi. Although only Acts II and III survive, this work is considered to be one of the greatest operatic compositions of the Venetian composer.  After the successful staging of Vivaldi’s Farnace in December 2021, Teatro Comunale di Ferrara ‘Claudio Abbado’ offers a a chance to discover live a rarely-performed production by the 'red priest', as Vivaldi was known.","popularity":0.051,"poster_path":"/aW7RqyR9CD9itzH02TnkDAwUySC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catone in Utica - Vivaldi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2585678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppe Valentino Buzza","original_name":"Giuseppe Valentino Buzza","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"641b0034142ef100ba35f1e7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2957833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arianna Vendittelli","original_name":"Arianna Vendittelli","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"641b003af9aa4700cde67c6a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3974246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Albano","original_name":"Miriam Albano","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"641b0040f9aa4700cde67c76","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3974248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeria Girardello","original_name":"Valeria Girardello","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"641b0046f9aa4700cde67c8d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3974249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chiara Brunello","original_name":"Chiara Brunello","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"641b004dd75bd60081adab26","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3974250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeria La Grotta","original_name":"Valeria La Grotta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"641b0054688cd000c65ae1ac","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2585682,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Federico Maria Sardelli","original_name":"Federico Maria Sardelli","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641b005f688cd0007d5f3189","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3974251,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marco Bellussi","original_name":"Marco Bellussi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641b0069f9aa4700cde67cac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aW7RqyR9CD9itzH02TnkDAwUySC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
