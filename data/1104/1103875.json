Internationally honored and beloved for his poignant, often irresistibly wry view of the human condition, Truffaut embodied the auteur's intimate grasp of the film medium. This documentary package -- a special supplement to Truffaut's films in The Criterion Collection -- is a multi-feature tribute that includes Truffaut's rare 1957 film, Les Mistons -- which foreshadowed The 400 Blows.","popularity":0.1201,"poster_path":"/qoBkEaHZduD0cFTn5owrUQoabiK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"François Truffaut: 25 Years, 25 Films","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3976417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Brian Stonehill","original_name":"Brian Stonehill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641ccabe8de0ae007b963ad9","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1629458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annette Insdorf","original_name":"Annette Insdorf","popularity":0.0749,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641ccacfbefb090088bdeff5","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3936010,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Morgan Holly","original_name":"Morgan Holly","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641ccb51e1faed010b35d46c","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2007498,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dan Williams","original_name":"Dan Williams","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641ccb7de0ec5100b85a7011","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":850,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qoBkEaHZduD0cFTn5owrUQoabiK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33490,"name":"filmmaking"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Laserdisc Exclusive Documentary","release_date":"1993-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
