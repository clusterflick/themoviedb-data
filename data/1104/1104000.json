Available to people with lower incomes or those trying to get off the streets, the buildings are frequently cramped, often noisy, and sometimes riddled with vermin. The film tellingly reveals inhabitants who are diverse and complicated and have a wide variety of needs that these residences and their staffs are often unable to meet. From a single mother trying to find her missing daughter to an elderly woman who is going blind and facing eviction, to the two ex-addicts co-parenting their son, the film gives voice to the broad range of people struggling to keep a roof over their heads in one of the wealthiest cities in the country.","popularity":0.0757,"poster_path":"/q0Yek4r8eqQz8dCnBKwCgIzpCaf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home is a Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2432258,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kevin Duncan Wong","original_name":"Kevin Duncan Wong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641d394d344a8e00f876ea59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2824725,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kristina Motwani","original_name":"Kristina Motwani","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643dcd6dfba62503136aa9ad","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4015741,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Seng Chen","original_name":"Seng Chen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643dcda20284200346f5de52","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2424490,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kar Yin Tham","original_name":"Kar Yin Tham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643dcd3ad9403504dcfcbc35","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116795,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Todd Sills","original_name":"Todd Sills","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643dcd55f706de0341298c9a","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27251222","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1485,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/q0Yek4r8eqQz8dCnBKwCgIzpCaf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1482,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7quUwq8zc0kYtQQEEnkeAH2YTyg.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
