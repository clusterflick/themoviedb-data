Guided by the belief that urban renewal should benefit - not displace - residents, Frances Goldin and her neighbors formed the Cooper Square Committee and launched a campaign to save the neighborhood. Over five decades they fought politicians, developers, white flight, government abandonment, blight, violence, arson, drugs, and gentrification - cyclical forces that have destroyed so many working class neighborhoods across the US. Through tenacious organizing and hundreds of community meetings, they not only held their ground but also developed a vision of community control. Fifty three years later, they established the state's first community land trust - a diverse, permanently affordable neighborhood in the heart of the \"real estate capital of the world.\"","popularity":0.3319,"poster_path":"/yx2PiyLx3LXsqRx8TQzlTyOU3QM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rabble Rousers: Frances Goldin and the Fight for Cooper Square","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3975500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances Goldin","original_name":"Frances Goldin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"641befee142ef1009b421dc5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2042159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelly Anderson","original_name":"Kelly Anderson","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/kPK1B2aCTLUBaTvLQ7HBcvz2KoK.jpg","credit_id":"66271b43221ba6017c16b7ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3975499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Joseph","original_name":"Ryan Joseph","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641befa6142ef100837f436e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2259955,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kathryn Barnier","original_name":"Kathryn Barnier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"641bef8295c0af007cd0d468","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26597919","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":1495,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yx2PiyLx3LXsqRx8TQzlTyOU3QM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":163082,"name":"gentrification"},{"id":210052,"name":"urbanism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rabble Rousers Trailer","key":"SQe73vm2BkY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2022-09-05T18:43:22.000Z","id":"641bf06795c0af00c5af328d"}]}}}
