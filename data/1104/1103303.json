His wife however loves going out and loved nature. Using the excuse of Covid he keeps her at home for over a year until she passes away in her sleep one night.

Roaming around the streets of Singapore Alvin bumps into Alice who works as a sugar baby. They begin to chat and Alvin gets introduced to the world of Sugar Daddies and Babies. He becomes famous amongst them as an old man who can’t go home and pays money to just talk and walk.
