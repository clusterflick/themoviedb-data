The album was released at a time when the US album charts were taken over by the psychedelic rock movement, and despite this, the album had the aforementioned chart success and would go on to sell over one million copies. This edition of the \"Classic Albums\" series focuses on The Band's follow-up to \"MUSIC FROM BIG PINK\". Featuring classics such as \"Up On Cripple Creek\", \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\", and \"Rag Mama Rag\", the story of the album is told through interviews with surviving members of The Band, fellow musicians Eric Clapton, Don Was, and George Harrison, and vintage footage. The Band is a classic album!","popularity":0.471,"poster_path":"/c7brSJ5lqVC7zv6GACfQ7CjVt7e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Classic Albums: The Band - The Band","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Classic Albums The Band","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231537,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bob Smeaton","original_name":"Bob Smeaton","popularity":0.0774,"profile_path":"/Aafmc2EGuPdrP6jL2FFOqhAGRCA.jpg","credit_id":"5b451d899251414f5c02e670","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0259254","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uAsaeLLckc1mOMIHzwmE6U16hVz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8x6nYOHLrI0yL0WPkyxsBj3wLNI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mxl21Vqe7zSYhBTx3YTyXwRCEGU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oFmmLWULbuAGYakMdemH872k3Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/c7brSJ5lqVC7zv6GACfQ7CjVt7e.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vAyGZZfq8mbRv0BD4Ln38fa9tUe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18001,"name":"rock band"},{"id":211707,"name":"roots rock"},{"id":212628,"name":"folk rock"},{"id":341496,"name":"the band"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
