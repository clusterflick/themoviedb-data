Label executives and soundtrack producers so loved the music of O Brother, Where Art Thou? that they brought it to life as a benefit concert for the Country Music Hall of Fame. Filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen loved it so much that they hired famed documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker to record the show for posterity. The concert that unfolded that night was one of the greatest musical moments in the annals of Music City. Performers: John Hartford, Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Gillian Welch, Chris Thomas King, The Cox Family, Fairfield Four, Union Station, Colin Linden, The Nashville Bluegrass Band, The Peasall Sisters, Ralph Stanley, David Rawlings, The Whites.","popularity":0.5815,"poster_path":"/fWQ5UP8pWpYSlhHxx1KLF3e2Z86.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Down from the Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":7.556,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":227014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alison Krauss","original_name":"Alison Krauss","popularity":0.3743,"profile_path":"/59wUTJ5BjjRIztFq5xRwnevRha4.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5692ceaf92514115c2002c3c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmylou Harris","original_name":"Emmylou Harris","popularity":0.3174,"profile_path":"/yR1AqJZu86kovV6PrRVCmxyjmU3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5692cec1c3a3684d04003136","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":942536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gillian Welch","original_name":"Gillian Welch","popularity":0.1346,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5692ced2925141540b000694","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":216727,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ralph Stanley","original_name":"Ralph Stanley","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":"/7CnsyFAJMvbXcbbXIjkDLrisgTV.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f6fe301e267de00322709a4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T Bone Burnett","original_name":"T Bone Burnett","popularity":0.1937,"profile_path":"/yovhYSs46safnXFQAHFjI3zUua1.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f6fe34ed38b580038e07c5c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ethan Coen","original_name":"Ethan Coen","popularity":0.6421,"profile_path":"/ccvoiEe3gEMAth1Oy8SJxVeMcAk.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f6fe35af2cf250037901fa2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Coen","original_name":"Joel Coen","popularity":0.7051,"profile_path":"/rgVaJNkZCgMarUcZuUAsVfXMWk3.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f6fe36af2cf250037901fe7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly Hunter","original_name":"Holly Hunter","popularity":1.6802,"profile_path":"/kC7KX03VAWvogOCuwKbMo4V6TuU.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f6fe37db458b800346317b5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Blake Nelson","original_name":"Tim Blake Nelson","popularity":1.6816,"profile_path":"/rWuTGiAMaaHIJ30eRkQS23LbRSW.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5f6fe388b458b8003563c17b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1239851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Hartford","original_name":"John Hartford","popularity":0.0472,"profile_path":"/llEicWDsbczIzvqDBAchieJGMOZ.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"624db06eabdafc0064430e27","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932222,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Doob","original_name":"Nick Doob","popularity":0.1581,"profile_path":"/pycmNCiCUnoCXH9ZnZrcZNDGVIb.jpg","credit_id":"62d76dcae194b001c7b18c79","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21113,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"D.
