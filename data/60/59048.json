Immersing himself in one of the victims, in the unconscious desire to eviscerate himself, a woman appears to him, Margherita, who, in the guise of Santa Maria d'Otranto, treats him with compassionate love. In the hallucinating succession of memories intertwined with historical events, the protagonist finds himself in contact with his environment, his land, his country.","popularity":0.3421,"poster_path":"/tLbbIF1Dpsu8B3tE0jvOXzruLG5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99788,"logo_path":null,"name":"Patara","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1968-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our
