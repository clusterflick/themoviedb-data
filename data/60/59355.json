First, the professor empties fluff and toys from the child's head, leaving him without the top of his head for most of the film. The professor then teaches the lad about illusions and perspectives, the pursuit of an object through exploring a bank of drawers, divining an object, and the migration of forms. The child then brings out a box with a tarantula in it: the professor puts his \"hands\" into the box and describes what he feels. The boy receives a final lesson about animation and film making; then the professor gives him a brain and his own open-book hat.","popularity":0.2649,"poster_path":"/2cFZ7au4nArf0zUfwuig5YZr8iW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16734,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atelier Koninck","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1984-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cabinet of Jan Švankmajer","video":false,"vote_average":6.838,"vote_count":40,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Quay","original_name":"Stephen Quay","popularity":0.1806,"profile_path":"/9Z8YMbCDR1xzNwfXdq2IQyUjnHy.jpg","credit_id":"52fe498dc3a36847f81a00a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Quay","original_name":"Timothy Quay","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":"/8hGRmypiLEoj4fYGa55kcq01z5s.jpg","credit_id":"52fe498dc3a36847f81a00ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229247,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Keith Griffiths","original_name":"Keith Griffiths","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/o8L1E5SnGVsSVuwIv5m5WotVUQL.jpg","credit_id":"52fe498dc3a36847f81a00b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229247,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Keith Griffiths","original_name":"Keith Griffiths","popularity":0.0516,"profile_path":"/o8L1E5SnGVsSVuwIv5m5WotVUQL.jpg","credit_id":"62c37e4df1b5711fe5ecb03e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Quay","original_name":"Timothy Quay","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":"/8hGRmypiLEoj4fYGa55kcq01z5s.jpg","credit_id":"62c37e620443c9004d04511d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Quay","original_name":"Stephen Quay","popularity":0.1806,"profile_path":"/9Z8YMbCDR1xzNwfXdq2IQyUjnHy.jpg","credit_id":"62c37e59f6fd180059983e4c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544515,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Zdeněk Liška","original_name":"Zdeněk Liška","popularity":0.0934,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f96f7b500fb6b0034b8da25","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0087016","wikidata_id":"Q7720896","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":855,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3ARcO9MrJTu8S2L2sTpnuOVzmal.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1519},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6JWadfXKdswg1qDehPhg7cQ9BrL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":865,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ffZDArMtX9TaRLqSVssFzSCpiyl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1538},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":810,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7tWMQmBJoAtpxNSEohiNTe78gdw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2cFZ7au4nArf0zUfwuig5YZr8iW.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6mdYMIRAOZ5b9k84ON1CTPks5T2.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB","release_date":"1984-06-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
