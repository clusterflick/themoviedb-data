denial and longing.","popularity":1.1642,"poster_path":"/fi9PJmu9YBHqIKwf1Rx3yZudHD5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Song
