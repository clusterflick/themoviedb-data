For starters, she's dead. A close second, she has found herself in a new job serving as a soul huntress for an evil overlord. Fallon accepts her new role and quickly turns loose on humanity. Her sinister supervisor, Mr. Sixx, is greatly impressed. Over confident in his new student, he assigns Fallon to a forbidden case -- one that ignites terrible memories and turns her against him.
