He is drinking too much whiskey due to his guilty complex since he had a love affair with a woman when Carol left home, and he has frequent blackouts, forgetting what he has done in the previous drinking night. Meanwhile a serial-killer is attacking women in the location, and the experienced American cop DCI Collins and the psychologist Frances Beale are invited to help the local police in the investigations. When Dr. Murray receives messages from beyond, he meets his friend Father Randall seeking spiritual support and explanation.","popularity":0.7763,"poster_path":"/y3N7du7Kau3VM8KpBxj8JEa7k0c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Victims are crying out from the grave.
