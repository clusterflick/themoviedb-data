His scathing comedy tackled tough topics no other comedian dared to touch. Fed up and disenfranchised with his career as a Pentacostal preacher, Sam left the ministry to try his hand at comedy. Almost immediately, and thanks in part to the foresight of Rodney Dangerfield who showcased Sam on an HBO special, his piercing scream, extreme humor and irreverent take on life attracted attention. Containing rare, early footage of Sam preaching and performing stand up at the world famous Comedy Store, the Award Winning \"Why Did We Laugh\" tells the story of a comedic genius who touched a deeper chord in people than most entertainers. Sadly, Sam was taken from us far too early, yet leaving us with a lasting and unique legacy.","popularity":1.7268,"poster_path":"/b8alikXtkJQwrJCUXGIPuV9EiK9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sam Kinison: Why Did We Laugh?","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Kinison","original_name":"Sam Kinison","popularity":0.4176,"profile_path":"/rjGlPffVAEe4hxUJoLPyRdaWSD1.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"52fe4984c3a36847f819e673","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Pryor","original_name":"Richard Pryor","popularity":1.1679,"profile_path":"/5hLh0btIkqYPbDmJ0i4WZo9OAt2.jpg","cast_id":22,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4984c3a36847f819e687","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodney Dangerfield","original_name":"Rodney Dangerfield","popularity":1.106,"profile_path":"/7ovx3TFiIlMbNfIxaYUtTOBydEr.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4984c3a36847f819e667","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis Miller","original_name":"Dennis Miller","popularity":0.472,"profile_path":"/AdO5Dm8xyuYvXIQEuzpBi6nG9QF.jpg","cast_id":21,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4984c3a36847f819e683","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":63739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Tenuta","original_name":"Judy Tenuta","popularity":0.2006,"profile_path":"/j3JWqRQGlczzDEJzBWjCuTpV2es.jpg","cast_id":23,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4984c3a36847f819e68b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Leno","original_name":"Jay Leno","popularity":1.0425,"profile_path":"/cplpY6q2VFtR7c1gMHM50wPzdU3.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4984c3a36847f819e67b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Matheson","original_name":"Tim Matheson","popularity":1.406,"profile_path":"/6oexiiYLJYXU6NjIhzlpA3mqYGF.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4984c3a36847f819e67f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beverly D'Angelo","original_name":"Beverly D'Angelo","popularity":1.664,"profile_path":"/8fYQIA8dAaA4GOTxOFSKIvTqzi.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4984c3a36847f819e663","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry King","original_name":"Larry King","popularity":0.5959,"profile_path":"/afNrrwBSbeFLrh0dVHvlMRRyont.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4984c3a36847f819e66b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":554223,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bill Kinison","original_name":"Bill Kinison","popularity":0.1371,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4984c3a36847f819e66f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl LaBove","original_name":"Carl LaBove","popularity":0.2029,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4984c3a36847f819e677","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":170411,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Carroll","original_name":"Larry Carroll","popularity":0.0881,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4984c3a36847f819e62f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":554224,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arnold H.
