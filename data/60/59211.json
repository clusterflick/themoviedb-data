Suspicion and passion hang in the air of the isolated campus until Matthew suddenly disappears. Fearing the worst, Louise struggles to uncover what happened to her lover but is foiled at every turn by Veronica, who begins to take a sadistic glee in the psychological torment she inflicts upon her. When a mysterious woman appears around the campus, Louise becomes convinced that she is being framed for the murder of Matthew, or even worse, being set up to be the next victim. Alone and friendless, Louise must keep herself alive long enough to uncover the truth of Matthew's disappearance.","popularity":1.7486,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"...a spooky, sexy thriller...","title":"Out of Bounds","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophia Myles","original_name":"Sophia Myles","popularity":1.1015,"profile_path":"/1WCCEfFzDYxBkBxCgGEApP4cwMn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Louise Thompson","credit_id":"52fe4985c3a36847f819eb37","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":31921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Ward","original_name":"Sophie Ward","popularity":0.597,"profile_path":"/2ePiAlSa7djGfSF12RKiwgQE4KR.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Veronica Van Huet","credit_id":"5c45282cc3a368478982379c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1243338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Asprey","original_name":"George Asprey","popularity":0.1662,"profile_path":"/9v3kXtXNtBVTWRe8qC8TodLX4Ab.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Matthew Van Huet","credit_id":"5c452851c3a3684782824c3c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Elphick","original_name":"Michael Elphick","popularity":0.4266,"profile_path":"/xVmedV04Myv3doYwlL3Tf2YWOjw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lionel Stubbs","credit_id":"52fe4985c3a36847f819eb3b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Celia Imrie","original_name":"Celia Imrie","popularity":1.2204,"profile_path":"/eEtVfESOVnkkdPLYkyQpalEwAwj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Doctor Imogen Reed","credit_id":"52fe4985c3a36847f819eb43","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":228985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Barrie","original_name":"Julia Barrie","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Isabelle Benallack","credit_id":"52fe4985c3a36847f819eb3f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Huw","original_name":"Richard Huw","popularity":0.2451,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"David Benallack","credit_id":"52fe4985c3a36847f819eb47","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Humphreys","original_name":"Chris Humphreys","popularity":0.1503,"profile_path":"/4vyilxIY9zwjONjquNldxNuIDQV.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Detective Inspector Amer","credit_id":"52fe4985c3a36847f819eb4b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":228986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Salmon","original_name":"Kelly Salmon","popularity":0.0591,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Phoebe Benallack","credit_id":"52fe4985c3a36847f819eb4f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":228987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Ibbotson","original_name":"Rachel Ibbotson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Francesca","credit_id":"52fe4985c3a36847f819eb53","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Rush","original_name":"Jason Rush","popularity":0.0682,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Police Officer","credit_id":"5c4528859251410e1b4d959b","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1504366,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tom Delmar","original_name":"Tom Delmar","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Taxi Driver","credit_id":"5c452897c3a3684793823934","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merlin Ward","original_name":"Merlin Ward","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4985c3a36847f819eb59","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1660253,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Janice Flint","original_name":"Janice Flint","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cf7a22e4a63894fabd86d7","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4909555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzanna Shaw","original_name":"Suzanna Shaw","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cf7aa3ccd4bed114722a4e","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2057423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark C.
