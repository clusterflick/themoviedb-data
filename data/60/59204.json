Their names: MONSTERS OF DEATH. Their character: vicious. MONSTERS OF DEATH doesn't waste your time with lullabies, instead it’s packed with the most deadly metal stuff conceivable: 55 video clips, cautiously compiled by Skandinavian-European and American style Death Metal, plus six live recordings and an ample audio section with new and unreleased stuff. In short: a blast for each and every death metal fan - not only because of the sheer amount of clips, but primarily because of their accurate selection.","popularity":0.2815,"poster_path":"/9hefUkmJU0dKPQoBaiuVfWa5Z8a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":205,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monsters Of Death Vol. 1","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1936,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9hefUkmJU0dKPQoBaiuVfWa5Z8a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1292}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":204425,"name":"death metal"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
