She was never heard from again. Her daughter Martine stayed in the small seaside town, where she became a doctor. Martine's daughter, Audrey, a thirty-year-old independent woman, returns to visit her parents. By chance, she finds a notebook that belonged to her grandmother, a diary that may at last explain her departure. Will it reveal the things left unsaid, that have altered the relationships within the heart of the family ever since? In it, will Audrey find answers to the questions that she is asking herself about her own future?","popularity":1.2937,"poster_path":"/15VFpJCjP68b0b2EeaF07CxTsUU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":309,"logo_path":"/eVdJe4ha50lW1Eop1tq93TMh1XW.png","name":"Angoa-Agicoa","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":591,"logo_path":"/q5I5RDwMEiqoNmfaJgd2LraEOJY.png","name":"France
