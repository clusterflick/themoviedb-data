She is quickly frustrated by the lack of progress in the police investigation and so begins her own. While listening to a fresh sound recording she made in her mother's house, Charlotte discovers a strange phenomenon, she can hear sounds from the past in her headphones.

discovered.","popularity":0.4581,"poster_path":"/c5HOqIBTdX7USFQULb3fxQsB7OB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fissures","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Fissures","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Ecoute
