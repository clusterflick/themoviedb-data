But he is haunted by the memory of a recent car crash and hounded by his estranged wife and her demands for divorce. Slowly, a festering insanity takes over and unwilling to face the outside world he embarks on a lunatic experiment. Confining himself to his middle-class home, he eschews contact with others and survives entirely off 'food' which he can find in his house. Based on JG Ballard's The Enormous Space.","popularity":0.9377,"poster_path":"/d4VZ0CsJMtOPqKpILvMJYLSKDYs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antony Sher","original_name":"Antony Sher","popularity":0.2754,"profile_path":"/e0V4i0avYfcfZORkt1tuORrIkGS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gerald Ballantyne","credit_id":"52fe498dc3a36847f81a0281","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":195544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matilda Ziegler","original_name":"Matilda Ziegler","popularity":0.9302,"profile_path":"/1vGZvZYl6K7KFEgGqYVvseeJMcp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Paula Goddard","credit_id":"52fe498dc3a36847f81a0285","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":135420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Findlay","original_name":"Deborah Findlay","popularity":0.5073,"profile_path":"/4FbdygLj08dfo63hNCZNc36FEr1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Margaret Ballantyne","credit_id":"52fe498dc3a36847f81a0289","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Henry","original_name":"Guy Henry","popularity":0.4802,"profile_path":"/e7CrEtyRrI4q4phB61EzY2Uo38f.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Martin","credit_id":"52fe498dc3a36847f81a028d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Allen","original_name":"Keith Allen","popularity":0.6057,"profile_path":"/1azvWtgKZ9u8oadJdsykij62X1z.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Repo Man","credit_id":"52fe498dc3a36847f81a0291","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":174734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Nagra","original_name":"Simon Nagra","popularity":0.0549,"profile_path":"/ams7lE9VvpQ6umwdMVxmWwo4FpA.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Policeman","credit_id":"52fe498dc3a36847f81a0295","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":47935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Curson Smith","original_name":"Richard Curson Smith","popularity":0.1271,"profile_path":"/mISljmvAObq7fpzISk8OATXLlKT.jpg","credit_id":"52fe498dc3a36847f81a0277","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13547,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"J.G.
