Produced for Pittsburgh's WQED, this informative documentary tracks his rise as floor manager for various NBC programs, such as Your Hit Parade, to the major awards he received later in life, such as the Lifetime Achievement Award and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Along the way, he's seen launching public TV programs The Children's Corner, which featured a soon-to-be-famous puppet named King Friday, and Canada's MisteRogers. The latter, naturally, was followed by Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, which made its national debut in 1968, and would eventually became the longest running program in PBS history. Hosted by fellow Pennsylvania native Michael Keaton (Batman), who worked on his show in the early days, America's Favorite Neighbor is suitable for all ages, but is geared more towards adults, particularly parents and educators.","popularity":0.3827,"poster_path":"/60eResWjHkCJLLpEG4ropzzUElL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16021,"logo_path":"/2bjAiWiyI4nUWzxLcnGejDO0amC.png","name":"WQED","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fred Rogers: America's Favorite Neighbor","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Keaton","original_name":"Michael Keaton","popularity":2.0095,"profile_path":"/baeHNv3qrVsnApuKbZXiJOhqMnw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5ece1ff4e4b576001f2a7204","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Rogers","original_name":"Fred Rogers","popularity":0.2687,"profile_path":"/d000aVyO5zYls7MrSCU6EhG4eoz.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Himself (archive footage)","credit_id":"60a3cd02e24e3a004056bed2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1257873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph J.
