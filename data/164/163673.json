She hails from a small working class town close to Toulouse where she lives with her comely mother, who grudgingly works as a babysitter, and her father, who loves herding ostriches. Her best friend in beauty school is an African immigrant lass named Gary who dreads being returned to her native country for an arranged marriage. Gary offers Solange advice in her quest. Though there is a guy Solange fancies at her vocational school, she wants to know the lay of the land, so to speak, before she gets intimate with him.","popularity":0.3702,"poster_path":"/7MNNuAWKWPNu8AKbLHAepcitPrQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girlfriends","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The
