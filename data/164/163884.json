This one-hour documentary details the technological innovations in the field of animatronics, art design, film making, and Henson's own brand of magic. Requiring 5 years of production, including over two years of pre-production, The Dark Crystal was inspired by the imagination of artist Brian Froud and conceived by scores of talented designers, builders, technicians, and performers. The World of the Dark Crystal shows how Jim Henson's Creature Shop in London and the Muppet Workshop in New York brought Brian Froud's art and Jim Henson's vision to life.","popularity":2.0973,"poster_path":"/eue90vKGguejoUfYOGMlKCd5W4i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2504,"logo_path":"/uuelgMOL4HJAJQcbJRiE4zlYbcU.png","name":"Jim Henson
