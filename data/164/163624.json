Having just bought a new camcorder, he travels to Iraq and captures his rare, intimate, and often times hilarious experience on camera.

some of the most remote parts of the Sunni Triangle.","popularity":1.2844,"poster_path":"/as3fUCqrekmdsVxwdpXuiNuYwRB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134205,"logo_path":null,"name":"Enough With The
