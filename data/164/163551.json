Mayu finds a camera floating in the ocean while on vacation. A very unusual camera. The film, mostly intact, reveals a picture of herself with a man she has never seen before. But that isn't the unusual part. This camera hasn't been made yet, and won't be made for another two years. Soon, Mayu finds herself swinging uncontrollably back and forth through time like a pendulum.  Part 2: \"Mystery Article File 538\" Written and directed by Mamoru Oshii. This episode follows a down-on-his-luck detective who accepts the first case to come his way: Surveillance of a man and a little girl. But who are they? And why do airplanes that fly over them turn into giant imperial carp? An investigator's normal methods don't apply when reality itself no longer applies.","popularity":1.3696,"poster_path":"/7Ua2ATnvYiAnObWEoa9X87FAQoc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6075,"logo_path":"/vlfJrLVL1TeNrCeeLBAwJXNv65M.png","name":"Studio Deen","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1987-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twilight Q","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":25,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":555157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masahiro Anzai","original_name":"安西正弘","popularity":0.3781,"profile_path":"/yOVDmUwZ2nyivDIob35vCva54IG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Uemura (episode 1) (Voice)","credit_id":"57f233399251414651006704","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mina Tominaga","original_name":"冨永みーな","popularity":0.9421,"profile_path":"/A1MTkgqfy8UYkQTOLhv3oxo7eYA.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Kiwako (episode 1) (voice)","credit_id":"5df99db5be2d49001251b27d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1688516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natsuo Tokuhiro","original_name":"Natsuo Tokuhiro","popularity":0.0504,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Father (episode 1) (voice)","credit_id":"57f234399251414645006640","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":110658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kumiko Takizawa","original_name":"滝沢久美子","popularity":0.679,"profile_path":"/w38K587p9wYejcnFeBooCrvRPW2.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mother (episode 1) (voice)","credit_id":"57f23473c3a3683f200126b1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1688550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tetsuya Segawa","original_name":"Tetsuya Segawa","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Man (episode 2) (voice)","credit_id":"57f2382bc3a368031b0040b6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1252774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yasuyuki Hirata","original_name":"平田康之","popularity":0.1531,"profile_path":"/2gAZHCyjYJMk47kS1OhCDLb37FC.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Hirata (episode 1) (voice)","credit_id":"57f23861c3a3680d020065d9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shigeru Chiba","original_name":"千葉繁","popularity":0.9094,"profile_path":"/mF5YJxApTYKBVFJDrEC9IrJ5ooV.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Radio voice (voice)","credit_id":"57f238a892514120f1004116","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57302,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kazunori Ito","original_name":"伊藤和典","popularity":0.3922,"profile_path":"/9JvpmIzDfIWCaLqHhSYdo3rRm1U.jpg","credit_id":"57f2296892514146a8005ee8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomomi Mochizuki","original_name":"望月智充","popularity":0.3034,"profile_path":"/64ZMBwbHjJgDFYBIILh1Orjziov.jpg","credit_id":"57f229b192514146a8005f1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mamoru Oshii","original_name":"押井守","popularity":1.2662,"profile_path":"/2eDakuSsipmgku9MtGcZf244Hv4.jpg","credit_id":"57f228aa925141211a0038e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57304,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kenji Kawai","original_name":"川井憲次","popularity":0.662,"profile_path":"/uKjPUmOMmYYMFYtLBNXBDPAtcOz.jpg","credit_id":"57f2324892514146a80063f3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mamoru Oshii","original_name":"押井守","popularity":1.2662,"profile_path":"/2eDakuSsipmgku9MtGcZf244Hv4.jpg","credit_id":"57f229dec3a368031b0038fc","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1262969","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.687,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Ua2ATnvYiAnObWEoa9X87FAQoc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1031}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-02-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
