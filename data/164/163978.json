Gordon Hempton is an Emmy Award-winning sound recordist who has spent the last 30 years trying to find and record the vanishing sounds of nature in an attempt to capture a disappearing sensory experience. Filmmaker Nick Sherman observes Hempton in the wilderness for 30 days and uncovers an obsessive artist on a quest for perfection in this obscure medium. Hempton’s natural ability to locate and articulate himself through sound has a contagious energy and gives his work a transportive quality. Soundtracker is a fascinating meditation on the world’s changing landscape and the things we may be leaving behind in the service of progress.","popularity":0.0706,"poster_path":"/kteHNZrK1ZbXCoQSbg6Fdjo2EtL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soundtracker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2900182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Hempton","original_name":"Gordon Hempton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"610cc726b234b9005ed11668","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Sherman","original_name":"Nick Sherman","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c72c3a36847f822e623","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1432989","wikidata_id":"Q129686907","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":1432,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kteHNZrK1ZbXCoQSbg6Fdjo2EtL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1006}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5774,"name":"forest"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
