By providing the originally silent images with a meticulously reconstructed soundtrack, the scenes from everyday life under siege seem to be set in the present. By not intervening in the montage but giving the scenes room to tell a story, the scenes transcend the specific historic events and lead a new life. They do not evoke memories of the past, but become a breathtaking reanimation of reality.","popularity":0.1506,"poster_path":"/5TssLW8Jj7HUogI7QQQzMgg4hPy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2006-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blockade","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":16,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Blockade","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Blokada","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"O Cerco de Leninegrado","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Loznitsa","original_name":"Sergei Loznitsa","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/gxs4Qqw5DjgbChJNU9cZ3UkK9Vw.jpg","credit_id":"6065b85bd1332400400d63c5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sergei Loznitsa","original_name":"Sergei Loznitsa","popularity":0.1481,"profile_path":"/gxs4Qqw5DjgbChJNU9cZ3UkK9Vw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c70c3a36847f822e243","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238623,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vladimir Golovnitsky","original_name":"Vladimir Golovnitsky","popularity":0.0832,"profile_path":"/l31CZDOz3llbpOHVBM38kI1Ov5w.jpg","credit_id":"5aa1ababc3a3686664003b89","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0826039","wikidata_id":"Q18712810","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iINqsi0dIjb9DGzfMstKueAx5tz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/bNH6apM9345souP28MnjcVdU82v.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1366,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5TssLW8Jj7HUogI7QQQzMgg4hPy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":910},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hqJ4PC1wrRTU2m2GcM8XwdxIVHj.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
