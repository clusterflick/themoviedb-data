The film aesthetic of the anti-Haider activists contrasts to today's official news footage. This gives emphasis to the multilayered clash of different political visions that occurred throughout the decade. In this sense the archive footage does not just transport information about the events it depicts, but though the contrasting materiality encapsulates the tensions between its many creators.","popularity":0.0761,"poster_path":"/emOYjSgRF6QozJlwvIEBtbEUcfK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":254779,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmbäckerei Wien","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Widerstand in Haiderland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1284315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frederick Baker","original_name":"Frederick Baker","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c06b3bc029139b0e35a7f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1284315,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frederick Baker","original_name":"Frederick Baker","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c06b45c029139b0e35a805","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3121807,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Antonia Adelsberger","original_name":"Antonia Adelsberger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c06b55e4a5b8bf00c8e0bc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1633519,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Benjamin Paya","original_name":"Benjamin Paya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c06b61b60bb98397358b50","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272863,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bernadette Stary","original_name":"Bernadette Stary","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c06b6fbc6935a001a25190","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272864,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karin Goritschnigg","original_name":"Karin Goritschnigg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c06b80e4a5b8bf00c8e0eb","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272865,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sandra Fasolt","original_name":"Sandra Fasolt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c06b90c153ece2e2a23d20","department":"Crew","job":"Dramaturgy"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272866,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joseph Rozsnyai","original_name":"Joseph Rozsnyai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c06b9bbc6935a001a251b7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5272867,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Wolfgang Zimmermann","original_name":"Wolfgang Zimmermann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c06bafc029139b0e35a85b","department":"Crew","job":"Post Production Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1816069","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/emOYjSgRF6QozJlwvIEBtbEUcfK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":705}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Widerstand in Haiderland | Filmtrailer","key":"dBJnJKIlwl8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-04-11T19:49:02.000Z","id":"67c06c4bbc6935a001a25253"}]}}}
