It is “serene, in the manner of ants”—to quote the title of the second section—but it is also elegiac and melancholy. Like two other old cranks (Godard and Straub), the director stays true to ideas about filmic composition gestated over many years and thereby provides a glimpse of a utopian cinema.","popularity":0.0689,"poster_path":"/bvPAFeYzMc0njZtBLVvMHdAtYiA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98531,"logo_path":null,"name":"Typee-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Studies for the Decay of the West","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Wyborny","original_name":"Klaus Wyborny","popularity":0.1741,"profile_path":"/wQRb6cnUErO4HuYmXsMFAmUglK6.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c71c3a36847f822e471","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Wyborny","original_name":"Klaus Wyborny","popularity":0.1741,"profile_path":"/wQRb6cnUErO4HuYmXsMFAmUglK6.jpg","credit_id":"5a342f88c3a3680b881b9e62","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Wyborny","original_name":"Klaus Wyborny","popularity":0.1741,"profile_path":"/wQRb6cnUErO4HuYmXsMFAmUglK6.jpg","credit_id":"5ed5e6e847c9fb00206bef0a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Wyborny","original_name":"Klaus Wyborny","popularity":0.1741,"profile_path":"/wQRb6cnUErO4HuYmXsMFAmUglK6.jpg","credit_id":"5ed5e933fea0d7001e8c4c74","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145485,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Wyborny","original_name":"Klaus Wyborny","popularity":0.1741,"profile_path":"/wQRb6cnUErO4HuYmXsMFAmUglK6.jpg","credit_id":"5ed5e9281b157d001f57da51","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2061814","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.712,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/bvPAFeYzMc0njZtBLVvMHdAtYiA.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":4,"width":534},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c2I6uBkkvvt2j5sodBBGCd8GCWj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Vienna International Film Festival","release_date":"2010-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Hamburg Film Festival)","release_date":"2011-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
