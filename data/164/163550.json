Several days before the ship is to dock, O'Hara gets a radiogram informing him that his wife has died at sea. That night a burglar breaks into the Antigue & Second Hand Shop ran by Sol Bloom, directly below O'Hara's flat. The burglar shoots O'Hara, who has rushed to his friend's aid, and, with his last breath he asks Sol to take care of Shandy. When Shandy arrives, Sol immediately makes him a member of the family, which also consists of a very mischievous motherless boy named Joey Bloom, whose pursuits consist of stealing oranges from fruit-dealer Tony, and playing hookey from school. Tom Varney, the young beat cop, is in love with Ruth Sneider, whose mother runs a Cleaning and Dyeling establishment. Ruth, however, is momentarily dazed with worthless Dave Haller.","popularity":0.4404,"poster_path":"/5yMteakK7ByCkpj0MC4DOTRlTxo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bryan Foy Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hearts of Humanity","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Hersholt","original_name":"Jean Hersholt","popularity":0.2104,"profile_path":"/aQ7HTIXEmlnwghYvWk5NS8NBI5M.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sol Bloom","credit_id":"52fe4c69c3a36847f822ccc5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackie Searl","original_name":"Jackie Searl","popularity":0.1613,"profile_path":"/1KlgdnAnkcFE0DaeYIKJa3sM9r1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Shandy O'Hara","credit_id":"52fe4c69c3a36847f822ccc9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
