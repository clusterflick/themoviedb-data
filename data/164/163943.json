Thus El árbol de las fresas begins with four of the now displaced former inhabitants reminiscing about their home and what they have lost. Eschewing drama and pathos, the opening sets the tone for what is an unusual documentary; the subjects often address the camera directly and even tease the filmmaker. In doing so they disrupt the usual relationship between viewer and subject in a playful way that allows both the viewer and the viewed to share equally in the filmmaking process.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jzD1Ua5vijF1G0Bsb94l1NVul3w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Strawberry Tree","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145490,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simone Rapisarda Casanova","original_name":"Simone Rapisarda Casanova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c71c3a36847f822e51d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1990996","wikidata_id":"Q24263048","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jzD1Ua5vijF1G0Bsb94l1NVul3w.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1064}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
