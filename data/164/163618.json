She occasionally then begins cutting herself, causing her husband, Yoshio, to intervene. Yoshio attempts to help Naoko by dressing as a woman, \"Yoshiko\", in whom Naoko can confide. Yoshio has a low sex drive, and hopes to stimulate his interest by having Naoko dress as a school girl. When so attired, shopping for appropriately adolescent socks, Naoko meets Kimiko, one of her female students. Kimiko's parents have abandoned her, and she stays with a strange man named Tokio. Naoko suggests that Kimiko come to live with her. At their home, Kimiko proceeds to seduce both Naoko and her husband. During a sex session with Yoshio, she binds him and paints obscenities onto his body.","popularity":0.6104,"poster_path":"/hltDvqx3Gk6izahROp4dT5ypYck.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1999-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Despite All That","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Sopping Wet Married Teacher: Doing It in Uniform","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Gushonure Hitozuma Kyôshi - Seifuku de Idaite","type":"Romaji"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Takeshi Itō","original_name":"伊藤猛","popularity":0.3954,"profile_path":"/2CLeWUSeKezsm2wW2mWziNHU8eV.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c6ac3a36847f822d0cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikio Sato","original_name":"佐藤幹雄","popularity":0.1425,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c6ac3a36847f822d0d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1482949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mitsuyo Suwa","original_name":"Mitsuyo Suwa","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"559187a2925141757a001b6f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1482950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Atsuko Suzuki","original_name":"Atsuko Suzuki","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"559187b1c3a3680800001cdf","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":895706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shinji Imaoka","original_name":"今岡信治","popularity":0.3843,"profile_path":"/ow9N7WCjy1kX2BVZM81a2xfWLVy.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c6ac3a36847f822d0c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":895706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shinji Imaoka","original_name":"今岡信治","popularity":0.3843,"profile_path":"/ow9N7WCjy1kX2BVZM81a2xfWLVy.jpg","credit_id":"63ffdfffc7176d007980703a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":634,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shōji Sakai","original_name":"酒井正次","popularity":1.1427,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b13263292514166c6009b4f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1029278,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kazuhiro Suzuki","original_name":"鈴木一博","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":"/ajivok7wJRHOgZcK0BXmW3wSrSN.jpg","credit_id":"5e10d4f4596a9106f7187bd4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0944102","wikidata_id":"Q7563193","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hltDvqx3Gk6izahROp4dT5ypYck.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":159551,"name":"pink film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
