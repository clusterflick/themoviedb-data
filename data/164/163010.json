It explores the life and work of Montreal's late great sculptor and print-maker Stanley Lewis for his contribution to Canada's rich art heritage and also portrays his love for his beloved Boulevard St. Laurent, affectionately known as the Main. This cinema-verity documentary chronicles the last years of Stan's eccentric life as he struggles with his health and creative legacy.
