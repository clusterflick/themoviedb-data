These are the ingredients for extreme climbing. The Huber brothers have plenty of this! For one last time, they want to prove to all their friends and followers that they can still handle extremely difficult routes. It is their last big goal and for this they chose an incredibly steep wall in the Alps that they have not yet been able to conquer. This is part of what is perhaps the most difficult route in the Alps, the \" Karma \" route.  The film also portrays the Huber brothers outside the world of mountains and climbing. The viewer will also get to know them as musicians and they will talk about the past, long-gone successes and failures. In addition to a very personal story, you will also see never-before-seen 3D images of extreme beauty and depth.","popularity":0.1811,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pushing the Limit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Huberbuam","type":"Alternative"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Huber","original_name":"Alexander Huber","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/ot9NXxLPH33UOyXfYm4jBgfPaLT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c6dc3a36847f822d9b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Huber","original_name":"Thomas Huber","popularity":0.1426,"profile_path":"/fSyjolxsNFSjEpdbHt4f7XCJadi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c6dc3a36847f822d9bd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145395,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Constantin von Westphalen","original_name":"Constantin von Westphalen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/tZb44T8VSzgfptLwwuHuuU6IoBo.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4c6dc3a36847f822d9df","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145391,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jens Monath","original_name":"Jens Monath","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c6dc3a36847f822d9c9","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145392,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Borig","original_name":"Peter Borig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c6dc3a36847f822d9cf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145394,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Frank Flick","original_name":"Frank Flick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c6dc3a36847f822d9db","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1145391,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jens Monath","original_name":"Jens Monath","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c6dc3a36847f822d9c3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Arens","original_name":"Peter Arens","popularity":0.0877,"profile_path":"/jJZq68s4vYDEFxiEJ0u9ovcEasZ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c6dc3a36847f822d9d5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2363242","wikidata_id":"Q45382735","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8624,"name":"climbing"},{"id":201008,"name":"rock climbing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
