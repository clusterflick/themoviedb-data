I found several of them who had remained in Thailand. Two years later, I invited one of them to make his first return visit to Japan and documented it in Outlaw-Matsu Returns Home. During the filming, my subject Fujita asked me to buy him a cleaver so that he could kill his ‘vicious brother.’ I was shocked, and asked him to wait a day so that I could plan how to film the scene. By the next morning, to my relief, Fujita had calmed down and changed his mind about killing his brother. But I couldn’t have had a sharper insight into the ethical questions provoked by this kind of documentary filmmaking.” —Shôhei Imamura","popularity":0.3773,"poster_path":"/p22iJFmXFFbe6PrE7E5TPhVJLbK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outlaw-Matsu Returns Home","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Muhô Matsu kokyô ni kaeru","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shōhei Imamura","original_name":"今村昌平","popularity":0.5269,"profile_path":"/uGc8ZRIapKU7NHqfdm5dmAerD3p.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4c64c3a36847f822bea1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shōhei Imamura","original_name":"今村昌平","popularity":0.5269,"profile_path":"/uGc8ZRIapKU7NHqfdm5dmAerD3p.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c64c3a36847f822be9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550543,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Masao Tochizawa","original_name":"栃沢正夫","popularity":0.1089,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e270d9afe224004fa23492","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1700045,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Matsuo Takahashi","original_name":"Matsuo Takahashi","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62e2709fe9da692ceea902a1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2027169","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p22iJFmXFFbe6PrE7E5TPhVJLbK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":170009,"name":"japanese soldier"},{"id":179012,"name":"estranged family member"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
