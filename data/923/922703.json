Saäl is Jewish, Ltaif is Arab. Together they overcome the divisive prejudices of their upbringing and embark on an engaging search for clarity, familiarity and historical significance among the immigrant communities of Montréal. Saäl uses super-8 home movies, old photographs, dramatizations and casual conversations to cross personal and political boundaries, giving voice to the varied ancestries of us all.","popularity":0.0637,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sleeping Tree Dreams of Its Roots","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1693074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michka Saäl","original_name":"Michka Saäl","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d2f9bc0cd32a0068cb2869","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":994881,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nathalie Moliavko-Visotzky","original_name":"Nathalie Moliavko-Visotzky","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/eer8MrIumCeV6I0ec7md5eb8LYq.jpg","credit_id":"6616aa650f1e58017d469573","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
