How ‘ah are ya doin' tonight?!” she asked in a Welsh accent. “Thank you so much for being a part of this show. It’s nice to be greeted by a warm audience, and you always have been, so thank you!” Her show was split into three acts, representing her three studio albums in the order they were released: Family Jewels, Electra Heart, and Froot. Every time she began a new song the audience would erupt in cheers, singing along so loudly that at times they drowned out Marina’s voice. Songs like “Primadonna” and “How to Be a Heartbreaker” generated massive cheers and a push towards the security gate, causing nearby security staff to flinch and move in towards the stage.","popularity":0.2365,"poster_path":"/knkiR82bRhd3jF3WvjpIGLByRo4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81368,"logo_path":"/srN5L2dTtbsb48VUHvpNG71pT7q.png","name":"Live Nation Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":21204,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yahoo!
