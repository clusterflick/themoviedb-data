It need not be said that the film is an overt attack on the senses, often making it difficult to bear. In an attempt to access novel sensations, it is our intention to elicit in the viewer a feeling of dissonance. We hope, then, that you choose to endure this intensity. The artistic and intellectual architecture of our film is rhizomatic, which is to say no such taproot of meaning can be excavated. But rather than simply surrendering yourself to this assemblage of disparate parts, we ask that you remain wholly conscious of your position as viewer throughout. So, for lack of a better word, enjoy (?)","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/h3mfIB3nOaSM6pC4xoLqkNhxaVL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diasporic Detritus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3367594,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Al Kotraba","original_name":"Al Kotraba","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d21f78aaec71008c9597e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":946,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h3mfIB3nOaSM6pC4xoLqkNhxaVL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":631}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
