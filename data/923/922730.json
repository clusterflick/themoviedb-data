Strangely self-absorbed, she is struggling with indecipherable little stuff in her palm (while Stalin's portrait rests casually under her arm). As the soundtrack, we hear Beethovenâ€™s Marmot played slightly out of tune, diligently and naively, by a child.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marmot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1439091,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olga Chernysheva","original_name":"Olga Chernysheva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d306827b7b4d0094ffc32e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
