A very good disc, I advise everyone. Although at first I was terribly upset, looking at a huge audience of people as much as one hundred and fifty, no less ... But then I remembered that a lot of groups finally performed in the studio, and nevertheless they recorded quite a blur of discs ... Here the option is different: the guys worked hard before an audience, albeit a small one.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/rHqTtACTJFRhobfx0m7B1ZhekCQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karcius - Live In France","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rHqTtACTJFRhobfx0m7B1ZhekCQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
