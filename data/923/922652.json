We are making sure everyone who can not attend a live performance this Australian Summer can join us for the final show of the original line-up via a virtual concert.  We have so much to celebrate and canâ€™t wait to have you dancing along with us from your lounge room or backyard.  The party will get started with a special piano solo set from our very own Ollie McGill before we move into two hours of The Cat Empire.  We have a set-list jam-packed with favourite songs from our entire career. Expect an unforgettable celebration with plenty of reflection and immeasurable joy.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cat Empire: Virtual Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qoaHCRjnIlTlEqRn3HCTcWGdn1n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
