In the rolling foothills of Alberta, the colts and horses run free with wild grace and speed, until it’s round-up time. Some are destined for the Calgary Stampede, the most exciting time for cowboys and ranchers who compete in the dusty ring to win at roping, bronco-busting, bulldogging a steer, and chuck-wagon racing, risking life and limb.","popularity":0.0516,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1946-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bronco Busters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2441758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurence Hyde","original_name":"Laurence Hyde","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d2ff11944a57006ac8ce1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1946-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
