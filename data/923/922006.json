In her own dry way, she tells him that she has been diagnosed with cancer and that things are not going well for her. Immediately Horst returns to his hometown with his wife Nada. Returning home brings back childhood memories - of a loving father and a mother who held the reins firmly in difficult situations. Horst tries his best to support his mother Margret - he organises doctor's appointments and tries to provide a little variety into her daily life, even though the relationship between mother and son has been strained for a long time: he counters his mother's edgy, frosty manner as he had learned to do when he was young. He emphasises the positive side of any situation and is always ready to respond with a snappy retort. When Margret learns how serious her illness really is, Horst begins to rethink his own life as well.","popularity":0.6743,"poster_path":"/czw1OUF1SENXakFTv9d3oJUKKUF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99996,"logo_path":"/liznTlaTMPe5rcFO5wSTSJAzyKj.png","name":"Bavaria
