Henri later takes charge of the lumber camp where Jacqueline lives, and is closely followed by Li Chang, who is blackmailing him to keep secret a murder he committed years earlier. The new boss is determined to win Jacqueline for himself and convinces her lover, Raoul Radon, that she no longer cares for him.
