Marijonas Mikutavičius, who is celebrating his fiftieth birthday this year, has been on stage since he was 18 and his song \"Trys milijonai (Three millions)\" has been called Lithuania's second national anthem. In the film, director Eimantas Belickas allows the viewer to be with Marijonas in his intimate surroundings, without the mask. As one of the country's most popular singers, Marijonas is a man, a father, a Lithuanian citizen, just like many of us. The viewer can see this clearly in the film, but at the same time it becomes clear that creativity makes the singer a unique personality.","popularity":0.413,"poster_path":"/dlupgdxNSQCx0mI1sxuOdt6fIkD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167176,"logo_path":null,"name":"make it happen","origin_country":""},{"id":167177,"logo_path":null,"name":"promostar","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2021-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The first documentary film about Marijonas Mikutavičius","title":"One in 3 million","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1331448,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marijonas Mikutavičius","original_name":"Marijonas Mikutavičius","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/t9PlpfEguTQB7I0Gqcc9iweQ62W.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Marijonas Mikutavičius/ himself","credit_id":"61d06c11025764006a6c67bf","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1598454,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Eimantas Belickas","original_name":"Eimantas Belickas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d06c8a944a570091dcaac9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3365754,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Algirdas Vaičaitis","original_name":"Algirdas Vaičaitis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d06dad22f5d7008f6dc6e0","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3365761,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Aurelija Krebsaitė","original_name":"Aurelija Krebsaitė","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d06e30c15f890067c0dc92","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3365755,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrius Kriščiūnas","original_name":"Andrius Kriščiūnas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61d06df27b7b4d0069c2f9c3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16446558","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"lt","file_path":"/dlupgdxNSQCx0mI1sxuOdt6fIkD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2032,"name":"pop singer"},{"id":7360,"name":"lithuania"},{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lt","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
