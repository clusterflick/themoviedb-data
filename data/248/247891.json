This desperately poor region has a long history of economic reliance on gold. This film is a melancholic portrait of the changes brought by the mine, and of the universal human desire for a better life. How do local people respond to the opportunities and economic divisions the mine creates? How do the local jobseekers and expatriate staff, attracted by gold and the possibilities it offers, understand one another? In case of difficulties, the mine calls in the military. Conflict over the mine's presence is escalating. The gold will be dug from the ground, but at what cost? End of the Rainbow reveals a world that is changing forever, and intimately portrays the people who are grappling to respond to those changes.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/aKJMKbIGVn70luJYdL94IOSX1N6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"End of the Rainbow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1283302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Nugent","original_name":"Robert Nugent","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f2bc3a36847f82c28ad","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1283302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Nugent","original_name":"Robert Nugent","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f2bc3a36847f82c28a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1283303,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rachel Sanderson","original_name":"Rachel Sanderson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f2bc3a36847f82c28a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1280657","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aKJMKbIGVn70luJYdL94IOSX1N6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
