Among the many pretty girls are Kissa, a natural vamp who delights in exciting men; Margo who is hard and tough, and Josine who is tender and romantic. They work in a feverish atmosphere and inflamed by the summer heat, youthful passions run riot, and the girls' sensual behavior cause rivalry among the men. Lorry driver Armand applies the same degree of ardor to his love-making as to his work, and his biggest rival is the boss' son, Berto, a strutting rooster who is very proud of his American car. After work each day, Kissa queens it in the cabaret on shore, and derives great pleasure in arousing jealousy between the men.","popularity":0.4138,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":19101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Contact Organisation","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":19102,"logo_path":null,"name":"PIP","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1413,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transmonde Film","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1961-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fruit Is Ripe","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Ernte der sündigen Mädchen","type":"theatrical"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Le femmine seminano il vento","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":57497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scilla Gabel","original_name":"Scilla Gabel","popularity":0.2046,"profile_path":"/eDhCJ0doSLLr0LkXyl4ouRVQLGW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kissa","credit_id":"52fe4f21c3a36847f82bf873","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Leroy","original_name":"Philippe Leroy","popularity":0.3956,"profile_path":"/d4hTg6vJpsUuzDz8iByBXs6B3Mv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Armand","credit_id":"52fe4f21c3a36847f82bf877","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1283188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Françoise Saint-Laurent","original_name":"Françoise Saint-Laurent","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Josine","credit_id":"52fe4f21c3a36847f82bf87b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":34606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Damien","original_name":"Eva Damien","popularity":0.1222,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Margo","credit_id":"52fe4f21c3a36847f82bf87f","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":85985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Lemoine","original_name":"Michel Lemoine","popularity":2.744,"profile_path":"/bbALNrdNdeVZPT6jr1zBVOvv2F4.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Berto","credit_id":"52fe4f21c3a36847f82bf883","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saro Urzì","original_name":"Saro Urzì","popularity":0.1637,"profile_path":"/wp88yz8T1TJcw5egiDu1m5a302D.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Buonacasa","credit_id":"52fe4f21c3a36847f82bf887","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Bisciglia","original_name":"Paul Bisciglia","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":"/rRpleKwfHaT1plFAPkZ9B9rlIt9.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f21c3a36847f82bf88b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Crouzet","original_name":"Roger Crouzet","popularity":0.2119,"profile_path":"/5TcfIuOEDzH77NcnvioSspW0vgU.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f21c3a36847f82bf88f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46787,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Fabbri","original_name":"Jacques Fabbri","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/kLHXFMzSKWSIr3byqGuukEoxh5l.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f21c3a36847f82bf893","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":52595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vittoria Prada","original_name":"Vittoria Prada","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f21c3a36847f82bf897","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1042678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hélène Tossy","original_name":"Hélène Tossy","popularity":0.1067,"profile_path":"/oQNhOko6rvWszifp0ztW7Q3Cwc6.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4f21c3a36847f82bf89b","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1040801,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Louis Soulanes","original_name":"Louis Soulanes","popularity":1.38,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f21c3a36847f82bf869","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":1040801,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Louis Soulanes","original_name":"Louis Soulanes","popularity":1.38,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f21c3a36847f82bf86f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0141090","wikidata_id":"Q17052228","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
