After hunting whales for generations, we have brought their widespread slaughter to an end, but these graceful giants still face threats on a number of fronts, and the battle to save them goes on.  This film takes an intimate look at four types of whales: pilots, humpbacks, bowheads and orcas, through the eyes of the humans who are closest to them. From the struggle to save a pod of pilot whales in the Florida Keys to the groundbreaking work of a scientist risking life and limb in the Arctic to the controversy over military sonar, you'll go to the front lines of whale conservation.","popularity":0.2904,"poster_path":"/j4Wy3i3EFwOcYPkfgMoZSDWaemN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This special takes you to the front line of whale conservation.","title":"Whales in Crisis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1226484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Carroll","original_name":"Michael Carroll","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"56075cba9251417a45000948","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1331612,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eleanor Grant","original_name":"Eleanor Grant","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56075cd292514130550033d3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1515506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Norfleet","original_name":"Bruce Norfleet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56075ce6c3a3681205003609","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1059009","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wXIqoVc5xC0015khYkz1urE9mcA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j4Wy3i3EFwOcYPkfgMoZSDWaemN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1063}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9902,"name":"wildlife"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
