After graduating from the Conservatoire with a first prize, he lives on hope, offering his classical works to publishers. One day, while driving customers to the races, he plays a \"toquard\": Maubeuge, who wins. With his friends, he celebrates the event and, for dessert, composes a song for the occasion: \"Tout ça ne vaut pas un clair de lune à Maubeuge\". Monique, a secretary at the radio station and one of the guests, had a record made of the tape recording. And this record, following a mistake, was broadcast on a religious music program. It's a runaway success: for Paul, it's fame and fortune. which he had obviously coveted, but more with his symphonies, opera and sonatas. No matter, the \"Clair de lune à Maubeuge\" (Moonlight in Maubeuge) allows two happily engaged couples to become happily married.","popularity":0.5471,"poster_path":"/i5NK0yFQuLQPeQvg3JvAo42tNme.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1962-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un
