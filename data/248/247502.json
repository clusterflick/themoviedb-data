In a similar vein to the National Theatre’s smash-hit classic comedies, She Stoops to Conquer and London Assurance, The Magistrate is sure to have audiences doubled up with laughter. When amiable magistrate Posket (John Lithgow) marries Agatha (Olivier Award-winner Nancy Carroll, After the Dance), little does he realise she’s dropped five years from her age – and her son’s. When her deception looks set to be revealed, it sparks a series of hilarious indignities and outrageous mishaps.","popularity":1.176,"poster_path":"/6XtyZ4brt6b4JtWRZlCZYdtPivA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16355,"logo_path":"/tWuPpLrD2urqKPXIit4VLTHWvgK.png","name":"National Theatre","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":152,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Theatre Live: The Magistrate","video":true,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12074,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lithgow","original_name":"John Lithgow","popularity":2.2714,"profile_path":"/8Y1sjBdnVR483S8PrnAQzlESwhx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Posket","credit_id":"52fe4f26c3a36847f82c103f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":983749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Carroll","original_name":"Nancy Carroll","popularity":0.785,"profile_path":"/lXTNopDRBsDLTlXTREvuBT3KMIt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Agatha","credit_id":"52fe4f26c3a36847f82c1043","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Cole","original_name":"Christina Cole","popularity":1.3533,"profile_path":"/lOcjHQgXg5rgM6zOr4k7SsMoABV.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Charlotte","credit_id":"52fe4f26c3a36847f82c1047","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110076,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Burns","original_name":"Nicholas Burns","popularity":0.2847,"profile_path":"/x8ETzUUeTrmBRuVdvPEaZ23Focf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Captain Horace Vale","credit_id":"52fe4f26c3a36847f82c104b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":133031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Blane","original_name":"Nicholas Blane","popularity":0.1232,"profile_path":"/i58S21yG7rHtnK2LqH3gSu2clWS.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mr. Bullamy","credit_id":"587d927d9251413f4601f5b0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":59084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Coy","original_name":"Jonathan Coy","popularity":0.5836,"profile_path":"/4uUXlmQ7p8a8RpXowVI90j0reEj.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Colonel Lukyn","credit_id":"587d92929251414101014fae","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1059833,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arthur Wing Pinero","original_name":"Arthur Wing Pinero","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f26c3a36847f82c1035","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1282535,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Timothy Sheader","original_name":"Timothy Sheader","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4f26c3a36847f82c103b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3311150","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6XtyZ4brt6b4JtWRZlCZYdtPivA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":674}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":246884,"name":"filmed theater"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"National Theatre Live: The Magistrate trailer starring John Lithgow, in cinemas 2 & 3 Feb","key":"_kNHUHO04GQ","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2012-12-18T23:28:16.000Z","id":"646176228c44b90119cad8c1"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"National Theatre Live: The Magistrate trailer","key":"AAO6M7MtHdk","published_at":"2012-12-13T17:10:46.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"533ec727c3a368544800ba5e"}]}}}
