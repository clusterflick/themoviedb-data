These are some of the questions posed by an Ecuadorian filmmaker whose latest movie was a commercial flop. He embarks on a query to find answers to his questions and relief for his despair. His research leads him to a giant contraband market in the port city of Guayaquil, where pirated movies from all over the world are sold for one dollar each. Here, he discovers a number of Ecuadorian low budget movies produced by amateurs, with titles he had never heard of before: from action packed productions to evangelical melodramas.","popularity":0.4609,"poster_path":"/tGiDFJ8Pp0tO9d6xa8QzC0iCBCP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2010-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond
