It is here that bear-hunting wolves take to the sea, grizzlies clash in titanic battles, and wild salmon are the pulsing lifeblood of an entire ecosystem. As this precious habitat faces an uncertain future, threatened by chainsaws and fish farms, a team of dedicated scientists is racing to prove that it must be protected. Forming a wilderness detective squad, these experts are searching for the rare white spirit bear and collecting clues that will decipher the secret life of the forest's elusive inhabitants.","popularity":0.8217,"poster_path":"/SH7LCg7TEwZj9u4dsB3Vf1sSl7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Journey to the untamed Great Bear Rain Forest where the wildlife is like nothing you have ever seen.","title":"Last Stand of the Great Bear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Great Bear Rainforest","type":"DVD title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith David","original_name":"Keith David","popularity":1.9636,"profile_path":"/jJLJuR7FNHYL1fB5igjj7IXzOel.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"56075a4fc3a36812050035a4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1346811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stella Cha","original_name":"Stella Cha","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65643b42b234b900c5eeb5a9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1441623,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anne Marie Hammers","original_name":"Anne Marie Hammers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65643b508f26bc00e23c4f2d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1441623,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anne Marie Hammers","original_name":"Anne Marie Hammers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65643b8fb234b90139288e9f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177883,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Emmanuel Mairesse","original_name":"Emmanuel Mairesse","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65643b1efb52990120012f8f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4180575,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeff Hogan","original_name":"Jeff Hogan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65643b67d9554b010036c49d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4399134,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gil Domb","original_name":"Gil Domb","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65643b81fb529901035108c7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4180575,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeff Hogan","original_name":"Jeff Hogan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65643b9d8f26bc0139f81963","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1250216,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rebecca Hartzell","original_name":"Rebecca Hartzell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65643c20a6c10400c40ae395","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38801,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Rosenfeld","original_name":"Michael Rosenfeld","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65643bbafb52990120012fdb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":22293,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maryanne Culpepper","original_name":"Maryanne Culpepper","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65643bef244182014e8a449c","department":"Writing","job":"Story Developer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1331612,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eleanor Grant","original_name":"Eleanor Grant","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56075a83925141305200336b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0438146","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1112,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/SH7LCg7TEwZj9u4dsB3Vf1sSl7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":785}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9902,"name":"wildlife"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hearald Sun - The Ultimate Wildlife Film Collection","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
