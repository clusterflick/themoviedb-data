During World War II, Gerron went from being a leading light of the German entertainment community (he made over 70 films and sang \"Mack the Knife\" in the first performance of The Three-Penny Opera) to a prisoner directing a propaganda film for the Nazis about a makeshift club at Theresienstadt, which was described as a \"concentration camp for celebrities.\" Gerron was eventually executed at Auschwitz. Director Ilona Ziok combines archival footage of Gerron with interviews of peers and survivors who describe how Gerron tragically believed his gifts as an entertainer would save his life -- and how he enthusiastically kept performing right up to his death.","popularity":0.1222,"poster_path":"/b2Qvok6q5QTGCFAUSSw6tLDE4mA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kurt Gerrons Karussell","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Becker","original_name":"Ben Becker","popularity":0.3942,"profile_path":"/kqbs0HjBo8LCErYXMgNfiC1YlD2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55dced779251410cf100034d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1500400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bente Kahan","original_name":"Bente Kahan","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55dced8bc3a368657a0008ec","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ute Lemper","original_name":"Ute Lemper","popularity":0.2184,"profile_path":"/dA8tIGkiztCVa62ncnFSvHWHsHb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55dced92925141745600094a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renée Saint-Cyr","original_name":"Renée Saint-Cyr","popularity":0.3022,"profile_path":"/9UhrcGBLJssnezw2qQ15cqLO8dR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"55dcedce92514174460008ec","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilona Ziok","original_name":"Ilona Ziok","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55dced4ec3a3681643000318","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0192218","wikidata_id":"Q28914448","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/b2Qvok6q5QTGCFAUSSw6tLDE4mA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
