Even though his birth was under a special star, his life is also full of ups and downs: gain and loss, victory and defeat, laughter and tears, all of this is always close together in Rando's life. And people from the most diverse backgrounds cross Rando's lifelines. Some are of good character and will help him, while others will throw a spanner in the works. But Rando is not the type to stumble; he masters any situation with vitality, irrepressible vigor and his proletarian instinct. Rando is often a wise man, but he is also often a fool -- those around him never know what to expect.","popularity":0.4217,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Bastard","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Hübchen","original_name":"Henry Hübchen","popularity":0.4474,"profile_path":"/bfObaQiK6YSoHlPP2bTDHRorL8U.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rando Beggerow","credit_id":"55e0603cc3a3682698002746","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ursula Karusseit","original_name":"Ursula Karusseit","popularity":0.1525,"profile_path":"/AukOs8q6ZiVGRvyvl8i4qh7WnBR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dorothea Beggerow","credit_id":"55e060b292514177d6002551","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marita Böhme","original_name":"Marita Böhme","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":"/uRtkYcvTtlK4PkHk6ZMfdBHLtWa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sieglinde Engelhardt","credit_id":"55e060be92514177e2002553","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":572429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Gendries","original_name":"Klaus Gendries","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":"/cnhat0LY9bUSRYmI5PVEMe72TYy.jpg","credit_id":"55e05ff292514177d600253e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3363775,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lothar Höricke","original_name":"Lothar Höricke","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6423d0f58de0ae007772f0c3","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3984411,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jürgen Groß","original_name":"Jürgen Groß","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6423cfdc960cde00e0bb0c71","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0085219","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
