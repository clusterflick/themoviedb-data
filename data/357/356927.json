In the second part, the whale is butchered at a whaling station. A lady with a parasol looks on, while in the background are the sailing ships used to hunt whales. These are excerpts from a 1909 film called \"La Pêche à Baleine dans les mers du Sud\" made by Jean Nédelec and cut down in the 1920's for the Pathé Baby home movie projector.","popularity":0.3914,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1909-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whale Fishing","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Whale Fishing in Southern Waters","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3912150","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33829,"name":"whaling"},{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1909-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Whale Fishing / Chasse à la Baleine (1909)","key":"D03SBGO24B8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-11-10T22:19:40.000Z","id":"67011d62fa3e69e0ef7cf81f"}]}}}
