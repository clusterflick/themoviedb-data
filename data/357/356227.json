Along with a survivor of the disaster, the nuclear physicist Andrei, as their leader, they create a commune on the island and establish there an esoteric school. The film presents the development of their ideas and their adventurous relation with the local community, as it is now Greece’s turn to sink inside its own big crisis. A quest for certainties in an era of total uncertainty.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/8nhwonjVGnka1wKrMcYoRAkeD48.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2013-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Immortals at the Southern Point of Europe","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"Οι αθάνατοι στο νοτιότερο άκρο της Ευρώπης","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiorgos Moustakis","original_name":"Yiorgos Moustakis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb379c266469a001ce1a527","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiorgos Moustakis","original_name":"Yiorgos Moustakis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb379ce66469a001de1e9a3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiorgos Moustakis","original_name":"Yiorgos Moustakis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb379e40cb335001fc73935","department":"Writing","job":"Original Concept"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628317,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yiorgos Moustakis","original_name":"Yiorgos Moustakis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb379edcc277c002165ddba","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2112580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikos Labôt","original_name":"Nikos Labôt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/Anw6hU8ndcqKRyptkiqqvolHxAT.jpg","credit_id":"5eb37a01cc277c002165de06","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2112580,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nikos Labôt","original_name":"Nikos Labôt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/Anw6hU8ndcqKRyptkiqqvolHxAT.jpg","credit_id":"5eb37a0af3e0df002029c4f3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2343454","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gdmx4wobk0ceSY34Zh2RWl6jeC2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8nhwonjVGnka1wKrMcYoRAkeD48.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":705}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Thessaloniki Documentary Festival","release_date":"2013-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
