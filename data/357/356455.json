It tells the story of Astral Pan, a street beggar, who takes us on a wild journey from the sidewalks of a wintry Montreal day, to the gates of Heaven and Hell and back. The great filmmaker passed away before finishing his film. Spare Change was completed by a friend, producer and singer-songwriter Laurie Gordon, assisted by a team of young, devoted animators.","popularity":0.0981,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spare Change","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Un peu de monnaie, s'il vous plaît?","type":"French title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1501057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurie Gordon","original_name":"Laurie Gordon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607da8fcf6787a00404168eb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":46434,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marcy Page","original_name":"Marcy Page","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607da90bf85958007ae2f236","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46435,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Verrall","original_name":"David Verrall","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607da924ae281100404d167a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3059458,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chiwawa","original_name":"Chiwawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607da93966f2d2006d34578f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Larkin","original_name":"Ryan Larkin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/2i05yiidkvO5VWVvVHhPWJr0vrZ.jpg","credit_id":"55df7be5c3a36864740001b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1501057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laurie Gordon","original_name":"Laurie Gordon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55df7beec3a368648000011d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Larkin","original_name":"Ryan Larkin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/2i05yiidkvO5VWVvVHhPWJr0vrZ.jpg","credit_id":"55df7bf6c3a368646e0001be","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148321,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Larkin","original_name":"Ryan Larkin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/2i05yiidkvO5VWVvVHhPWJr0vrZ.jpg","credit_id":"55df7bffc3a3686468000165","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1410057","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
