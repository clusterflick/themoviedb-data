It's an amazing spectacle of late 80's/early 90's indie-music icons. KMFDM's En Esch, Ministry's Chris Connelly, Nine Inch Nails creator Trent Reznor, Nivek Ogre (Skinny Puppy), William Tucker (RIP), Raven (Prong/Killing Joke), Andrew Weiss (Rollins Band/Ween), and leader-slash-drummer Martin Atkins (Public Image Ltd./Ministry/Killing Joke) keep this video spinning with their over-the-top antics and Spinal Tap-ish tour foibles. This should be in your video collection between the Who's \"\"The Kid's Are Alright\"\" and Dave Markey's \"\"1991: The Year Punk Broke.","popularity":0.2746,"poster_path":"/598m6gygwzig5FUbQYWOpNNnjDa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172348,"logo_path":null,"name":"Invisible Records","origin_country":""},{"id":202822,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rubber TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pigface: Glitch","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Connelly","original_name":"Chris Connelly","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/sb5NahkM1XF31J7v0t7UH8dz0m9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6496d459bbd0b00144f36f98","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4128628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Hoxley","original_name":"Ian Hoxley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6496d487bbd0b000e72f25bf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1834295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Tucker","original_name":"William Tucker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6496d524b3440900c54ebbe2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nivek Ogre","original_name":"Nivek Ogre","popularity":0.2584,"profile_path":"/uaWhp6ivcX40nFByjuQ0m3MJaU4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6496d7feb34409013983f70a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3186,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Trent Reznor","original_name":"Trent Reznor","popularity":0.297,"profile_path":"/v6DcTfFqFTFaR8gqMK6sOODKS0T.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6496d82dbbd0b00144f37117","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Rieflin","original_name":"William Rieflin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6496d975955c6501444d4e64","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2425715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Raven","original_name":"Paul Raven","popularity":0.1037,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6496d9976f43ec00e27d655f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4128641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Schultz","original_name":"Matt Schultz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6496db72b3440900c54ebe57","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Barker","original_name":"Paul Barker","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6496dbaceb79c200e29e7fb8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4128646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Weiss","original_name":"Andrew Weiss","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6496dbf6955c65012427d2eb","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"En Esch","original_name":"En Esch","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"6496ddb062f33500ca431ae4","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":399681,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Yow","original_name":"David Yow","popularity":0.1946,"profile_path":"/rbL8wH5G8gBd93RjOcfcFLC3e2l.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"6496ddd7955c6500ac88c93a","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":150997,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Atkins","original_name":"Martin Atkins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6496d2ce62f33500ca43167e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1901732,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ron Faiola","original_name":"Ron Faiola","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6496d32fbbd0b000e72f253b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/598m6gygwzig5FUbQYWOpNNnjDa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"VHS","release_date":"1992-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
