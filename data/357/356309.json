Benoit now lives as a toymaker who sells games at his chic Paris art gallery. The film opens with young Lila as she is being released from prison. Immediately, she sets out to see her sister in Brionne, a tiny Normandy town. As soon as he sees her, the rather quiet Benoit falls in love. Eventually, the emotionally scarred young woman falls in love with him too. Soon they move in together, and Lila gets to meet his ne'er-do-well friends. The couple are very happy for a while, but when Benoit's gallery goes belly-up, he begins acting strangely, leaving Lila feeling very unsure. Eventually she leaves him. Benoit then struggles to cope with his depression; after many drunken nights, a lost dog helps him find the peace he has been searching for.","popularity":0.4388,"poster_path":"/nv8LWCnJZ4b9w2pfgBi9ujjZu9Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1115,"logo_path":"/ntH7T5gsN6wtyrfHGHJDTuneQ7o.png","name":"M6 Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":26803,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salomé","origin_country":""},{"id":55522,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ahora Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out in the Country","video":false,"vote_average":5.917,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benoît Régent","original_name":"Benoît Régent","popularity":0.2271,"profile_path":"/hSCNZq6w24lJUTJpRNyiVTtQ9lL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55ddf9779251417452002fae","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":136757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judith Henry","original_name":"Judith Henry","popularity":0.2265,"profile_path":"/n50CGQNAn1TnNLqYGbwQVnnqBak.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55ddf9819251417450002fcb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergi López","original_name":"Sergi López","popularity":0.5922,"profile_path":"/n3HcmUflYYaHUiQmzaayi0yqcRf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"55ddf98b925141744b002f4e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":580587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Jacques Vanier","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Vanier","popularity":0.1084,"profile_path":"/7oL75SBj5CP4jNmpPfRQ28PQI7r.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"55ddf99d9251417452002fb2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serge Riaboukine","original_name":"Serge Riaboukine","popularity":0.156,"profile_path":"/G2Lv14IXlkK5WuwaS89XbJF5Ki.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"55ddf9a59251417456003105","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Élisabeth Commelin","original_name":"Élisabeth Commelin","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/bDnIJ1c0WUPdXKNecIQmMoeNa3u.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"55ddf9aec3a3686572003253","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":122571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laure Duthilleul","original_name":"Laure Duthilleul","popularity":0.147,"profile_path":"/2jSz08w9z5EFEm0vZfh6yIdi05t.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"55ddf9b89251417444002f24","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":123611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Élisabeth Vitali","original_name":"Élisabeth Vitali","popularity":0.2897,"profile_path":"/2hydpVewqqe3fxbubCMm365gYVV.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"55ddf9c0c3a3686580002f9e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Céline Poirier","original_name":"Céline Poirier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"55ddf9c9c3a3686580002fa2","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Poirier","original_name":"Manuel Poirier","popularity":0.1628,"profile_path":"/awLPMefvWRDmwsoL5jHlGTba5ig.jpg","credit_id":"55ddf954c3a3684a7f0003d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuel Poirier","original_name":"Manuel Poirier","popularity":0.1628,"profile_path":"/awLPMefvWRDmwsoL5jHlGTba5ig.jpg","credit_id":"55ddf95bc3a368657700345c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0115070","wikidata_id":"Q3594824","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ktSKC4WX6G13y0gn4Bn3X85aAAN.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lP3B11jq3hX7GBw7qphffaGLDZk.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nv8LWCnJZ4b9w2pfgBi9ujjZu9Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
