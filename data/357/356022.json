When the opportunity arises to bump him off without getting her hands dirty, she takes a chance she may never get again. After his murder at the hands of criminal Richard Hayden, she begins to receive inopportune visits by Melvin's old business partners about a large shipment of moonshine in her possession. Contacting the FBI for help, agent Ron Sheridan is assigned to her case and develops an unrequited love for Katie. But when a full-scale war develops, she learns the FBI may not be much help to her as she thought, and Katie must take matters into her own hands to pay off her husband's debts for good.","popularity":0.6077,"poster_path":"/7ZS8s02QXj4sCBkGPut9MaZhmFQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98904,"logo_path":"/ddIBh6fLrmXVCVd0jNKVXzeKmuC.png","name":"Wild Dogs Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Cat Whiskey","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"American Moonshine","type":"DVD Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1948714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vanessa Leigh","original_name":"Vanessa Leigh","popularity":0.1435,"profile_path":"/4EIANk1tRNzFwHDocZ3j9eofnpI.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Katie Connors","credit_id":"5a43326f9251411f4f05d895","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1792396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Koerner","original_name":"Jeremy Koerner","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":"/qxfqEba0OGgzgrXJHNT1c7gUGMg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Richard Hayden","credit_id":"5a4332820e0a264fd20474db","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1948716,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Allen Brewer","original_name":"James Allen Brewer","popularity":0.0938,"profile_path":"/21W9bvYjIOpQ8CDa7EAjS9C64iF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ron Sheridan","credit_id":"5a4332920e0a264f3904a9eb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1947768,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ray Medved","original_name":"Ray Medved","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/rISNKrHsPNdkbDKrEqAwuqvnfbw.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Red Conors","credit_id":"5a4332a2c3a368584404b553","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gift Harris","original_name":"Gift Harris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/yl7CZx7v0iCz3CEYcclFlTKRQX8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Willie Anderson","credit_id":"5a4332bec3a368586c04761f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1948721,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George S.
