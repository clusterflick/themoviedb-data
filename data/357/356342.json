His mother is still down there at the airport. His father isn’t even there to wave goodbye. At the time, Zanyar is only five years old.  23 years later Zanyar, soon to be a father, sits in his kitchen in a suburb of Stockholm. His father, Taher, sits in front of him. Any day now, Zanyar will become a father himself and he knows that he can’t wait anymore. He has to confront his father with the question he has been afraid to ask all his life: How could Taher leave him in the midst of a war and then send him to Sweden all by himself?","popularity":0.202,"poster_path":"/6hddGl2mbJ0DDSbRxe0jBkNhJz6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61810,"logo_path":"/fCTx5ZgcOvCVCorbgx6hgXdjBrZ.png","name":"Sant &
