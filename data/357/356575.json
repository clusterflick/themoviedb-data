While she works as a journalist in the cultural sector, he is an independent artist teaching at a local college. The unconventional yet well-liked pedagogue can get his students to enjoy almost anything, even nude drawing. Until one day the police turn up – and accuse him of sexual misconduct. Max and Eva are shocked when the allegation comes at them like a bolt out of the blue. Following several interviews, however, it soon becomes clear that the girl did spend a night at Max’s atelier the previous weekend. Sabine Boss’s TV drama shows how social and media instigation can back a teacher into a corner.","popularity":0.1938,"poster_path":"/vwnkRvxat9vRbz1WFum8tMQLKCA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28950,"logo_path":"/8RuUUKhPiJbICV03XO79IhSh8CH.png","name":"Dschoint Ventschr
