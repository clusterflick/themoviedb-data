In 1943, a 24-year-old maths student and a GPO engineer combined to hack into Hitler's personal super-code machine - not Enigma but an even tougher system, which he called his 'secrets writer'. Their break turned the Battle of Kursk, powered the D-day landings and orchestrated the end of the conflict in Europe. But it was also to be used during the Cold War - which meant both men's achievements were hushed up and never officially recognized.","popularity":0.5016,"poster_path":"/eDFpppyR1XAuciDNGNtDJu47Xxd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4762,"logo_path":"/cey5EAFwOb7AfDOsQ4p4q5MixzX.png","name":"BBC Cymru Wales","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Code-Breakers: Bletchley Park's Lost Heroes","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Codebreaker - The Secret Genius Of World War Two","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keeley Hawes","original_name":"Keeley Hawes","popularity":1.2362,"profile_path":"/9Zt8IHLR1PGso3fSV155LZ1jPCE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"66b72108aae939dcb5a8c38c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Carey","original_name":"Julian Carey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1a1410efea7a0016c1b24b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1514339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julian Carey","original_name":"Julian Carey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff07268839d93003ee3c462","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2491866","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2sfbXA2kP2wXfrhQHwlR0bBukXB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eDFpppyR1XAuciDNGNtDJu47Xxd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
