Sima doesn't want to let his son fight for the wrong side any more, and doesn't want to give him to the Partisans either, so he hides him in his attic for the time being. The story is interwoven with episodes of Sima trying to muster a beautiful stallion - Sokol - who only answers to his son Beneš and clearly doesn't like his old man.","popularity":0.3722,"poster_path":"/aXqqic0rdSs2wsAuUYrFXFkgwFB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5724,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zagreb
