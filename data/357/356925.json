The main attraction of the show was the first ever 8-man single elimination deathmatch tournament, which featured Cactus Jack, Terry Funk, Shoji Nakamaki, Hiroshi Ono, Leatherface, Tiger Jeet Singh, Terry Gordy and former FMW wrestler Mr. Gannosuke. The show also featured an NWA World Heavyweight Championship defense, as Tarzan Goto challenged then-champion Dan Severn for the title.  The standout in this tournament were the three matches in which Mick Foley wrestled. The first one was a \"Barbed Wire, Baseball Bat, and Thumbtack Match\". The second was a \"Barbed Wire Board Spike Nail Match\". The third was a \"Barbed Wire Rope, Exploding C4, and Time Bomb Match\".","popularity":0.3518,"poster_path":"/cBIrxKvxtwnFfZY3eZowaAOS4Ez.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"King of the Death Match Tournament","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Foley","original_name":"Mick Foley","popularity":0.5898,"profile_path":"/u5ibrKCxOVgEmsz8oAIq4mRErCx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Cactus Jack","credit_id":"5d0c8fad925141524db8a53b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Funk","original_name":"Terry Funk","popularity":0.2714,"profile_path":"/4MjY3dWMC2FiqIZLFBzj8RN9SFW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Terry Funk","credit_id":"5d0c8fb59251414d04b8a5e5","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cBIrxKvxtwnFfZY3eZowaAOS4Ez.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
