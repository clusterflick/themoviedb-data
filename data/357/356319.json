The story takes place in a gold-rush community where the locals are taken to the cleaners by duplicitious Eastern gamblers. When it becomes obvious that the local constabulary has been \"bought off\" by the crooks, two-fisted cattleman Jim Bannister (Brown) swings into action. The film's highlight is an outsized fistic brawl between the hero and secondary villain Breed, played by loose-limbed comic stuntman Frank Mitchell.","popularity":0.5709,"poster_path":"/xfxwG79rF6eYknbcEVLK2ArYNbq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1940-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Blasting wide open the toughest town of the west!","title":"West of Carson City","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Mack Brown","original_name":"Johnny Mack Brown","popularity":0.1439,"profile_path":"/ybBL0QUDeYqwuDOenOl8N1ACaal.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jim Bannister","credit_id":"55ddff57c3a36827d60000a4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Baker","original_name":"Bob Baker","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/yQI4rIGxcMwfTyXefgsvxB5BmDH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Nevada","credit_id":"55ddff65c3a36827e700008b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fuzzy Knight","original_name":"Fuzzy Knight","popularity":0.1765,"profile_path":"/vv3sXhvCEpZxeG8WucH4p6JdaYl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Banjo","credit_id":"55ddff6fc3a36827d80000a0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":102363,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Moran","original_name":"Peggy Moran","popularity":0.1255,"profile_path":"/cZTuRNk1CprkEmrlwGMqGuaWIRd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Millie Harkins","credit_id":"55ddff7a9251411c3b000082","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Woods","original_name":"Harry Woods","popularity":0.1381,"profile_path":"/usSay3yVB6wxsLs3UA94b8CqdzC.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mack Gorman","credit_id":"57586870c3a3685fbd0000d7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Homans","original_name":"Robert Homans","popularity":0.1678,"profile_path":"/4milvzRXMyVrDsVNdZ70pQwyPx.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Judge Harkins","credit_id":"5758687cc3a3685fb70000af","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1040608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al K.
