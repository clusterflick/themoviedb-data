The film is a powerful look at colonial betrayals, told through a striking montage of archival images and a ballad composed by Dunn himself about the legendary 19th-century Siksika (Blackfoot) chief who negotiated Treaty 7 on behalf of the Blackfoot Confederacy. The IFC’s inaugural release, Crowfoot was the first Indigenous-directed film to be made at the NFB.","popularity":0.4141,"poster_path":"/8EoxgaMSaKZok3pvstrJTAGFqTf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":136492,"logo_path":null,"name":"Challenge for Change / Société Nouvelle","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ballad of Crowfoot","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86484,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barrie Howells","original_name":"Barrie Howells","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wl9j33wHjYwssXlzwnlDwjyFBRX.jpg","credit_id":"6097b2e7a894d600407b1be5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1375758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willie Dunn","original_name":"Willie Dunn","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6097b2fe0929f6003ddc5e5d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1375758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willie Dunn","original_name":"Willie Dunn","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60a0dc14b0ba7e00583ebfd7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1375758,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willie Dunn","original_name":"Willie Dunn","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"594ac8b1925141311f00237d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0222782","wikidata_id":"Q61764855","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hicKsNHbesHy4Zd9bZbByH4e5SO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8EoxgaMSaKZok3pvstrJTAGFqTf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xBFQNleIuIoFJIYlRoRDTcOVV1r.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":154866,"name":"archive footage"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"},{"id":314681,"name":"mi'kmaq"},{"id":339197,"name":"colonial betrayal"},{"id":339198,"name":"scottish folk singer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Chicago)","release_date":"1969-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
