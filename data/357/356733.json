Simone, a solitary multimedia artist in her twenties, is struggling to control her crushing panic attacks and keep her day job in an underground parking lot. And Simone, a sixty-year-old physicist, is giving a conference on the nature of time. The three Simones' lives are intertwined in a labyrinthine meta-world where timeframes overlap, characters multiply, and storylines repeat and expand. But, for all its shuttling forward and back through time, ENDORPHINE remains grounded in the Simones' inner lives — it's an artistic examination of scientific phenomena that also poignantly explores how people deal with trauma.","popularity":0.714,"poster_path":"/f1ZwGLPxzIgJaH3v8cNzu9Kh1eO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7029,"logo_path":"/i49Jb3md21vxSOY3bBXRvCRXYKX.png","name":"micro_scope","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endorphine","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":22,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Эндорфины","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Эндорфин","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1008607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie
