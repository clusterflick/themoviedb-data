It's an amazing spectacle of late 80's/early 90's indie-music icons. KMFDM's En Esch, Revco/Ministry's Chris Connelly, Nine Inch Nails creator Trent Reznor, Mary Biker, William Tucker (RIP), Raven (Prong/Killing Joke), Andrew Weiss (Rollins Band/Ween), Danny Carey (Tool), and leader-slash-drummer Martin Atkins (Public Image Ltd./Ministry/Killing Joke) keep this video spinning with their over-the-top antics and Spinal Tap-ish tour foibles. This should be in your video collection between the Who's \"\"The Kid's Are Alright\"\" and Dave Markey's \"\"1991: The Year Punk Broke.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pigface: Son Of A Glitch","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
