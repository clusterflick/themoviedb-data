Featuring Loriot in multiple roles, the program playfully disrupts the typical talk show structure with absurd interruptions and cleverly crafted sketches. Originally aired on November 13, 1974, it marked Loriot’s first full creative venture as writer, director, and performer. Elements of Loriot’s Telecabinet later resurfaced in his iconic comedy series, cementing its place in German television history.","popularity":0.2549,"poster_path":"/hqLeWlO4lbT81iagc8WWVF3yLkA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Südfunk
