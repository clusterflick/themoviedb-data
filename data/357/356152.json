A young boy receives an old violin as a gift out of kindness from a foreign trader. From then on, it becomes a treasured possession as he teaches himself to play the instrument over several years, until it was lost during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. After the war, the violin was found by a man working for the British Military Administration and given to his young daughter. The girl learns to play it and becomes a renowned violinist over the decades. She eventually passes the instrument on to her grandson, an accomplished violinist himself, who restores it and performs in a concert by the Singapore River, where the violin started its unexpected journey nearly 80 years ago.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/4GFWnvN5lCY8O1exaQCNmS62VvS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61718,"logo_path":"/enzHXbyAAJi6sBLuAxswMGGr4l7.png","name":"Robot Playground Media","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2015-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Violin","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","title":"小提琴","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1500339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ervin Han","original_name":"Ervin Han","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55dc9b24c3a3686574000287","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1500339,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ervin Han","original_name":"Ervin Han","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55dc9b1a9251417448000273","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500341,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"August Lum","original_name":"August Lum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55dc9b57c3a3686572000298","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"theviolinsg","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2385,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4GFWnvN5lCY8O1exaQCNmS62VvS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1590}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Violin Trailer 2","key":"128245184","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-05-19T11:20:58.000Z","id":"5d909afe79b3d4001f8ed9d4"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Violin Trailer 1","key":"122292422","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-03-16T07:50:30.000Z","id":"5d909ae7ec1879000ed577e5"}]}}}
