During the 1970s dictatorship, he broke sexual taboos with a \"strange\" behavior on stage and became one of the most famous brazilian singers. Inspired in Cassiano Ricardo's concrete poems and the experimental music of Ney's repertoire, \"Bird-Man\" explores a sound and visual lyrical aesthetic of high contrasts that approximates man to nature's feelings.","popularity":0.1398,"poster_path":"/a8g3txR6a4K80vgko7LhKsbXcrc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bird-Man","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1264129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ney Matogrosso","original_name":"Ney Matogrosso","popularity":0.236,"profile_path":"/wtmJrao1axnMFj23bpQoqeBLG1w.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"55dd8b24c3a3686582001caa","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Cunha","original_name":"David Cunha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55dd8b1bc3a3681643001767","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1500508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafael Saar","original_name":"Rafael Saar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/zU7ZPG5LmLIceUW0FAHkBSGNTa5.jpg","credit_id":"55dd8acac3a3681643001754","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1500508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rafael Saar","original_name":"Rafael Saar","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/zU7ZPG5LmLIceUW0FAHkBSGNTa5.jpg","credit_id":"55dd8aef9251417446001d9d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500509,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernardo Canto","original_name":"Bernardo Canto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55dd8afd9251417450001e43","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1776203","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/a8g3txR6a4K80vgko7LhKsbXcrc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":530},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AdfXk1soeF6oE6rPcGAzjsWZKjG.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
