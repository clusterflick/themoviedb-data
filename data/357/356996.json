In West of Sonora, Starrett once again plays a frontier good-guy named Steve (Steve Rollins, to be exact), who, when the need arises, disguises himself as The Durango Kid, masked righter of wrongs. This time, Steve/Durango champions the cause of 10-year-old Penelope Clinton (Anita Castle), who has spent her short life as the focus of a feud between her grandfathers, suspected outlaw Black Murphy (Steve Darrell) and Sheriff Jack Clinton (George Cheseboro).","popularity":0.6337,"poster_path":"/4QX9OIxfIlV0Hzma1oDXh60jYG8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"ACTION!","title":"West of Sonora","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Starrett","original_name":"Charles Starrett","popularity":0.2938,"profile_path":"/7DhidPyO8Z3regVeobzhRcbqlZT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Steve Rollins / The Durango Kid","credit_id":"55e4727592514137ec0044fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Darrell","original_name":"Steve Darrell","popularity":0.1418,"profile_path":"/mPADuDDsXkXBaxl51CAKQCVpH0r.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Black Murphy","credit_id":"55e4727e92514137dd004387","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Chesebro","original_name":"George Chesebro","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":"/s8A5WerpnAjIom4ezjiTEcDEOc4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sheriff Jeff Clinton","credit_id":"55e4728692514137e6004417","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1502591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Castle","original_name":"Anita Castle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Penelope Clinton","credit_id":"55e47291c3a3684197004611","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Smiley Burnette","original_name":"Smiley Burnette","popularity":0.2736,"profile_path":"/hfwpyujboZDjvsEqOEBxT5vJ9U5.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Smiley Burnette","credit_id":"576847839251416c3b00031d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582417,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ray Nazarro","original_name":"Ray Nazarro","popularity":0.1698,"profile_path":"/pQ1pF6pAEuKCAOFvrnk05PBN9Pw.jpg","credit_id":"55e4726992514137d70043c6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":161984,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Barry Shipman","original_name":"Barry Shipman","popularity":0.0808,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576847559251416c460002b2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2271633,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Glenn Adams","original_name":"Glenn Adams","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c9f5f5bc3a368735981578a","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0040955","wikidata_id":"Q15689633","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1007,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nxMH2UGVlcxBQhoOth67BVI5Dzf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1790}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2875,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4QX9OIxfIlV0Hzma1oDXh60jYG8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1917}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1948-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
