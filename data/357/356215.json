An aging gardener takes her in to try to protect her from the harsh world, though secretly, he too lusts after the young girl, in spite of his impotence cause by the war. She goes to school, where morality and empty platitudes are mouthed, but the attempts at life's lessons are foiled by the realities of the cabaret world. While the school and the gardener try to protect her innocence, the young girl is lured by the temptation of the worldly cabaret, and her womanhood is awakened.","popularity":0.2372,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":19712,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crown Seven Film Productions","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1976-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ligaw na Bulaklak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Wildflower","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1123466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alma Moreno","original_name":"Alma Moreno","popularity":0.2847,"profile_path":"/n3N7iznEMRvastw9slUNkovRRIt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"55dd52d5c3a3686577001686","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":165857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vic Silayan","original_name":"Vic Silayan","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":"/cXlcTWcy4xDhOT8LxkB9cLzpGbQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"55dd531a925141744b001403","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":279078,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marissa Delgado","original_name":"Marissa Delgado","popularity":0.1331,"profile_path":"/1dPSNIeTwuwR7TQQYO26PkojRLv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"55dd5323925141744400145a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charina Alonzo","original_name":"Charina Alonzo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"55dd534dc3a36865820013bb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":227221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Linda","original_name":"Anita Linda","popularity":0.2559,"profile_path":"/dSHGBgQepsTB9O7FFDVnnfIJWkO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"55dd535792514174520014e9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500452,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jun Mariano","original_name":"Jun Mariano","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"55dd535f92514174480014a6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elvie Escaro","original_name":"Elvie Escaro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"55dd536792514174560014ae","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Garcia","original_name":"Edgar Garcia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"55dd537d9251417446001420","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1354684,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edgardo Reyes","original_name":"Edgardo Reyes","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55dd52a5c3a3686582001397","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ishmael Bernal","original_name":"Ishmael Bernal","popularity":1.056,"profile_path":"/ffacEqfqoy8tVLUfmctM7ER2nUl.jpg","credit_id":"55dd5269c3a368657a0013ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329543,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Arnold Alvaro","original_name":"Arnold Alvaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55dd53af9251410cf1000dfa","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1358689,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Edgardo Vinarao","original_name":"Edgardo Vinarao","popularity":0.1046,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55dd53ca92514174480014bc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":574035,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ernani Cuenco","original_name":"Ernani Cuenco","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55dd53a292514174500014bf","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500455,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Betty Gosiengfiao","original_name":"Betty Gosiengfiao","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55dd53e99251417444001482","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0279196","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6895,"name":"philippines"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
