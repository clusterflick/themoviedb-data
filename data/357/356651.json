Widowed, Ming is set to marry Ye Yue  (Miao Pu) much to the consternation of Ming’s “Rebecca”-like  housemaid Zhen Zi (Ayumi Ito of “All About Lily Chou-Chou”), who just  happens to be his late wife’s sister. Yarn hints at paranormal causes as more of Ming’s business associates die one by one, but an early slip gives the game away. Zhang’s helming, aided by Japanese vet Yudai Kato’s lustrous lensing, is inventive, but a heavy glazing  of horror cliches make this cracked yarn damaged goods.","popularity":0.2011,"poster_path":"/uwfboQOLLsLTDI3p6RSQxF1UTzM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clay Fear","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":118726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miao Pu","original_name":"Miao Pu","popularity":0.2851,"profile_path":"/sdYRCxw36vyUsEbIeSldwtqrvR1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ye Yue","credit_id":"6430b7f91b729400f1e20378","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence Ng Kai-Wah","original_name":"吳啟華","popularity":0.7058,"profile_path":"/3xRYtS2dQxRNxyFz3OYZUeU5lso.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ming Fu","credit_id":"6430b80b1dbc880113f75bec","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayumi Ito","original_name":"伊藤歩","popularity":0.9028,"profile_path":"/9uc0XnA8nAcCYInxUq5nkNSHc7N.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Zhen Zi","credit_id":"6430b82a1283e900d6d24010","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1603598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhang Jiabei","original_name":"Zhang Jiabei","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6430b7b61f98d10268b1b4e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1006964","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1672,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uwfboQOLLsLTDI3p6RSQxF1UTzM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1187}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
