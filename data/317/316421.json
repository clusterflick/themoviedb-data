Seeley and Steve Sekely), A Nosty fiu Esete Toth Marival was released in English-speaking regions as I Married for Love. Feri Noszty (Paul Javor) is a handsome but irresponsible Hussar officer who prefers a life of wine, women and song to his military responsibilities. Unwilling to bow to family pressure, Feri refuses to marry heiress Mary Toth (Eva Szorenyi) for her dowry alone. But Mary falls in love with the prideful Feri, and to win his affections she poses as her own poverty-stricken maid. Based on a novel by Kalman Mikszath, A Noszty Fiu Esete Toth Marival was filmed simultaneously in Hungarian- and German-language versions.","popularity":0.3241,"poster_path":"/xOIZHCkrdfa7QhBtHyVL3ud0XWS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90056,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pictura Film
