The first one---Sailing\" has young Hattie sailing her boat in a fountain and is quite dismayed when a frog sinks it. She brightens up when a friendly policeman restores it for her. The second unrelated segment---\"The Village Band\"--- features Hamilton Ham in the story of a village band that goes unappreciated by the populace until it is needed to greet a distinguished dignitary.","popularity":0.0427,"poster_path":"/kat76Y8tbtGJn8xayeQGxFFLxJw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1958-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sailing and Village Band","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1411196,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Crippen","original_name":"Fred Crippen","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54afcda0c3a3682e1b001ac5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1411197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lew Keller","original_name":"Lew Keller","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54afcdab9251414afd001d2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0148693","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1687,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gzj1SmxFTVORyN34inh3wemjEwO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2998}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1305,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kat76Y8tbtGJn8xayeQGxFFLxJw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":870}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1958-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
