Now he needs something to eat for breakfast. The hungry spider is hoping to make his breakfast from the various visitors in his web, but oh, boy, is he in for a big surprise! He traps a honeybee in his web; the irate bee threatens him with a sting and gets away. Next, he gets a British wasp. The wasp thinks that he wants to have breakfast and a spot of tea with him. No tea, no wasp. Next, a little moth... only the moth snares the spider in his own web and takes it home to his mother for breakfast... Features a cool jazz music score and a wild visual design.","popularity":0.3691,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":146463,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paramount Cartoon Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keep the Cool, Baby","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Silver","original_name":"Joe Silver","popularity":0.2576,"profile_path":"/A0vk5ZnczujRSV2s0M0t3iUCySM.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Spider (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"6670a4d3279acbbd0f50bb3b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allen Swift","original_name":"Allen Swift","popularity":0.2498,"profile_path":"/62vJi6tRedgNoGm8vFi1UZhrd3X.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Bee / Moth (voice) (uncredited)","credit_id":"6670a4df706df3ce1226773c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shamus Culhane","original_name":"Shamus Culhane","popularity":0.1332,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fe59fcdb4ed610343eaf09","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Winston Sharples","original_name":"Winston Sharples","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fe59efefea7a011ab6f031","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1949225,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Gil Miret","original_name":"Gil Miret","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fe5a37e0ca7f014f6f72b7","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1458346,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Nick Tafuri","original_name":"Nick Tafuri","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fe5a756a222700c3b4dda6","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148154,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shamus Culhane","original_name":"Shamus Culhane","popularity":0.1332,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fe5a62c2ff3d013810b2bf","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1208524,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Doug Crane","original_name":"Doug Crane","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fe5a6dc2ff3d00ac085e1b","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3979935,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Dante Barbetta","original_name":"Dante Barbetta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fe5a49fa4046011bf9fd4f","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4264769,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ruth Kneitel","original_name":"Ruth Kneitel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fe5a5affc9de0eded320c6","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1209611,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chuck Harriton","original_name":"Chuck Harriton","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54b01597c3a3680951000087","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0148370","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1967-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
