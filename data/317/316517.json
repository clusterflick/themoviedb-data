So she takes him to a canine psychiatrist. He recommends she and her husband treat Bobo as \"one of the family\". That means the man has to tolerate it when Bobo takes the evening paper and one of his master's cigars. But he won't let him watch his dog adventure show when there's a baseball game on or have the whole steak at dinner. And if Bobo wants to really be a part of the family, wait till he gets assigned some chores.","popularity":0.0585,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":146463,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paramount Cartoon Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1962-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One of the Family","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seymour Kneitel","original_name":"Seymour Kneitel","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/6HeCQ7XXSDjQbl2RN6iYrs1zjX0.jpg","credit_id":"54afe3bd9251414a3d001ba3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151836","wikidata_id":"Q113754342","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-12-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
