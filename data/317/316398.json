She continues into the tribal lands of the Northern Frontier, hangs out with some Samburu tribesmen, tracks lions in Laikipia, and participates in a young Pokot boy's initiation ceremony into manhood.  From there she takes a beautiful flight over the Rift Valley to the Masai Mara Game Reserve to stalk the dangerous buffalo. She makes a quick trip to the capital Nairobi and gets to spend some wonderful time up close to baby elephants in Daphne Seldrick's elephant orphanage. She ends her trip on the coast in the remote Arab trading port of Lamu.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Globe Trekker - Kenya","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
