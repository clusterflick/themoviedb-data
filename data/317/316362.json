The Parson repeatedly rises up, in a fit of sleepwalking, and reaches the cupboard, while muttering the need to feed the \"churchkitten\" and \"churchmouse,\" but then proceeds to drink the milk and eat the cheese himself. Eventually, the kitten and mouse enlist the aid of a neighboring puppy named Trumpet to achieve their goal.","popularity":0.3799,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gabriel Churchkitten","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Beck","original_name":"Jackson Beck","popularity":0.2105,"profile_path":"/3roBQ7ank7nAp4jQwR1kY06PoTM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pastor (voice)","credit_id":"54af016e92514169e00028af","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Questel","original_name":"Mae Questel","popularity":0.415,"profile_path":"/jJ9U8K3yp09u81JG1n1wiViXqvX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Peter (voice)","credit_id":"54af01789251414afd0001da","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecil Roy","original_name":"Cecil Roy","popularity":0.0748,"profile_path":"/pY2HuXlu71mHv1VsKkX4gb7hIST.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gabriel Churchkitten (voice)","credit_id":"54af01829251414a3d0001b6","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410842,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margot Austin","original_name":"Margot Austin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54af015fc3a3684abf000d3d","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seymour Kneitel","original_name":"Seymour Kneitel","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/6HeCQ7XXSDjQbl2RN6iYrs1zjX0.jpg","credit_id":"54af013c925141152c0023c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410841,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Graham Place","original_name":"Graham Place","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56800a8f9251417def00d8db","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410841,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Graham Place","original_name":"Graham Place","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415cb26e74146007c81c12a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1123500,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Robert Little","original_name":"Robert Little","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415cb1131032500c5a968ac","department":"Crew","job":"Scenic Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2547135,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Louis Zukor","original_name":"Louis Zukor","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415cb306a2227010c4b6818","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1239652,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Oriolo","original_name":"Joseph Oriolo","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/yq7ZW8rqtFk8m5feI1WncWEZBRO.jpg","credit_id":"6415cb406a2227008de793d8","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2283775,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"George Cannata","original_name":"George Cannata","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6415cb3831032500e8a1ac07","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0150676","wikidata_id":"Q5515572","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1944-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
