But even with all this hard work, sometimes unexpected things can happen. Who would have guessed that Thomas would rocket past the proud and fast Gordon, thanks to a surprising push from a jet engine? And is Percy's imagination getting the best of him, or are naughty gnomes really playing tricks around the old mine? Can horses fly? Well, Harold certainly can make them - especially when one needs a lift to a big Island celebration. And who says that engines are only Really Useful on the tracks? See how Salty and Fergus save the day when the light goes out on the Island's lighthouse during a big storm. Join all of your Island friends as they go full steam ahead with some great adventures. And remember to always expect the unexpected!","popularity":0.7817,"poster_path":"/sF2HXoxj3a32LLl7z8GhFKxNHdj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"PEEP!
