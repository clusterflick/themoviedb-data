Crooked jeweler Ralph smashes the watch with a hammer, telling Percy that it's out of style. He then proceeds to sell Percy a cuckoo clock with a little dead bird, which Percy replaces with a baby eagle (feeding it super eagle food). Percy goes away, and when the eagle begins to grow, it's too much for him. He returns the clock, and he and the eagle attack Ralph.","popularity":0.1824,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":146463,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paramount Cartoon Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1962-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Without Time or Reason","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053827,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Lawrence","original_name":"Eddie Lawrence","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/wF6qAMkYlFceqxSEx8ud6wq6MUM.jpg","credit_id":"64fe5bd7db4ed610430815e6","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1093240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Winston Sharples","original_name":"Winston Sharples","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64fe5be0db4ed610343eb186","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89755,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seymour Kneitel","original_name":"Seymour Kneitel","popularity":0.3293,"profile_path":"/6HeCQ7XXSDjQbl2RN6iYrs1zjX0.jpg","credit_id":"54afe14ec3a3683fba00432c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0153880","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-01-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
