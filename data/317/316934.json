The guests include a domineering mother (Lola Braccini), her petulant daughter (Bianca Doria) and the daughter's gigolo boyfriend (Guido Notari). Also on hand is a worldly vamp (Laura Nucci) who also falls for the boyfriend, and the chronic-gambler son (Andrea Checchi) of the hotel's self-sacrificing landlady (Emma Grammatica). Though the film is set in Budapest, the characters are more Mediterranean than mittel-European. Piccolo Hotel was one of the entries in the Vienna Biennial Film Festival.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1939-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Piero Ballerini","original_name":"Piero Ballerini","popularity":0.091,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54b17c0ec3a368094e002904","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0031798","wikidata_id":"Q18202742","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1939-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
