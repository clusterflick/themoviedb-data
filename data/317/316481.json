A juggler has little success making a living; he puts on a hair shirt and becomes an ascetic, but attracts only other ascetics. Finally, in desperation, he becomes a monk. He visits the other monks, who all glorify the Lady with their skills: cooking, painting, sculpture, etc. He tries helping them, but botches it. A festival is held for the Lady, and each of the monks offers his gift, but the juggler has nothing. Frustrated, he juggles for her, all night, alone.","popularity":0.1328,"poster_path":"/pWYIdMktdXHWmpcx682HHL7UGJ2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42019,"logo_path":"/mFPTppw3q4tY9R2b7QxVv4zevLi.png","name":"Terrytoons","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1957-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Juggler of Our Lady","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Karloff","original_name":"Boris Karloff","popularity":0.7586,"profile_path":"/fVi0QkiziavXB8HnWk5NzRcnCO1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"54afccd5c3a3682e40001aa9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1116271,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"R.O.
