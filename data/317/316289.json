She falls in love with Ned Thayer, a young American, but refuses to divorce her husband because of the attendant scandal and disgrace. Sir Bruce gains possession of a love letter written to Ned by Lady Helen and divorces her. Ned goes to Africa, and Lady Helen comes to the United States, where she encounters Rudolph Solomon, an art collector who wants her to become his mistress. The noblewoman at first refuses, but when her money runs out, she agrees to the proposal and attends a party at his home. Ned, who has learned of the divorce, comes looking for Helen and meets her at Solomon's party. Lady Helen is so humiliated and ashamed that she rushes from the house and throws herself in front of an automobile.","popularity":0.5463,"poster_path":"/z5DRZEMDYoV55o7Nbs57SKgiKgT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20936,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corinne Griffith Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Déclassé","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Declassee","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Hughes","original_name":"Lloyd Hughes","popularity":0.1403,"profile_path":"/ejZIGbXs0wObn0e9g7BlDF1JTTz.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ned Thayer","credit_id":"54ae8b619251410aaa00026f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1054643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corinne Griffith","original_name":"Corinne Griffith","popularity":0.1424,"profile_path":"/aBcI7FfEVDDlxPMnxOoX8bmozL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lady Heelen Haden","credit_id":"54ae8ba2c3a36877440002e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clive Brook","original_name":"Clive Brook","popularity":0.1758,"profile_path":"/sXJNPN7SXA0cgSuACDSlLfbIMCJ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Rudolph Solomon","credit_id":"5d5e2be54a52f80014d9cfde","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97989,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Fazenda","original_name":"Louise Fazenda","popularity":0.3299,"profile_path":"/koJe4g2nqMB58S92UUV8Spa4fj4.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mrs. Walton","credit_id":"5d5e2beaf263ba0014944d9f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rockliffe Fellowes","original_name":"Rockliffe Fellowes","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":"/bkat22QmibDbdrwtg05RW68RpiJ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Sir Bruce Haden","credit_id":"620171731e9225004257eb3a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hedda Hopper","original_name":"Hedda Hopper","popularity":0.205,"profile_path":"/kfXPY1cSrOmjJ3TYrGF4giT6EPI.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Lady Wildering","credit_id":"62017185af2da800ce3f6682","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilyan Tashman","original_name":"Lilyan Tashman","popularity":0.1303,"profile_path":"/vZPbaXbyMUxnxtEjiJYaMuvWD9T.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mrs. Leslie","credit_id":"62017193326ec100b7530ae8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1130795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gale Henry","original_name":"Gale Henry","popularity":0.0574,"profile_path":"/dLa3f1fyHaUTPdXOJN0B6lixKlc.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Timmins","credit_id":"620171a11365450e0af63489","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1269815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bertram Johns","original_name":"Bertram Johns","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Sir Emmett Wildering","credit_id":"620171afaf2da8006921dc26","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eddie Lyons","original_name":"Eddie Lyons","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":"/fYf7CyV9OkfEoyFEMrINiQGlZMa.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Mr. Walton","credit_id":"620171be1fd36f00c45f6a39","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Carillo","original_name":"Mario Carillo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/tyxGEyyLcZZjP4h0Dio6v2DZaGY.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Hotel Manager","credit_id":"620171cc76142100b4f155a1","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Weigel","original_name":"Paul Weigel","popularity":0.1576,"profile_path":"/9NTRs4Hkg1HbEXd2zHINobcfwH8.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Henri","credit_id":"620171d916893500f9048dff","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert G.
