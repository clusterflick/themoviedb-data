There she meets Donald's upstairs neighbors, his ex-fiancée Cynthia and her father, roguish David Slader. Both men are determined to bed the young woman, but they quickly discover Patty is more interested in engaging in spirited discussions about the pressing moral and sexual issues of the day than surrendering her virginity to either one of them. After resisting their amorous advances throughout the night, Patty leaves and returns to the Empire State Building, where Donald finds her and proposes marriage.","popularity":1.0663,"poster_path":"/w0XR39ibBNmJ3GJYjnmCNHyGkFc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60,"logo_path":"/4YldLvCWQL9VIAHQ2Fu3Ffkh9Si.png","name":"United Artists","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl on The Roof","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"La Vierge sur le toit","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37777,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hardy Krüger","original_name":"Hardy Krüger","popularity":0.6461,"profile_path":"/mWykFvz2kjBtx8uA3X3yK6mmWlH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Donald Gresham","credit_id":"54b1a34392514107e000136e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johannes Heesters","original_name":"Johannes Heesters","popularity":0.1971,"profile_path":"/xH4eozg4D5gLyQyYxc1fixC0sOL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"David Slader","credit_id":"54b1a356c3a3680939002cf3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Matz","original_name":"Johanna Matz","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":"/4vekKkD1zkr1lOuNYi1kxaJE84M.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Patty O'Neill","credit_id":"54b1a37292514114a2000144","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Tully","original_name":"Tom Tully","popularity":0.2394,"profile_path":"/qi73NpsUzob7d7J1QedheooTZgE.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Michael O'Neill","credit_id":"54b1a387925141746c00271c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":72717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dawn Addams","original_name":"Dawn Addams","popularity":0.4669,"profile_path":"/jdkF0IUkajyfcyKtD1OB3RqC2M4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Cynthia Slader","credit_id":"54b1a39692514107e0001375","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fortunio Bonanova","original_name":"Fortunio Bonanova","popularity":0.1789,"profile_path":"/39RJP5GMzaw1Bh6hBaYK6qsEDW1.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"TV host","credit_id":"65454a169d6e3306cb87dfee","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Ratoff","original_name":"Gregory Ratoff","popularity":0.2616,"profile_path":"/u7uLiwMka8ipsZU5YE3jxe3HVcH.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Taxi driver","credit_id":"65454a239d6e3306cb87dff5","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Holden","original_name":"William Holden","popularity":1.1317,"profile_path":"/yx5LpyKzCc4H52mFjybrPTuwKPM.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"A tourist","credit_id":"65454a31d8cc4a00e3cadc1a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maggie McNamara","original_name":"Maggie McNamara","popularity":0.181,"profile_path":"/8fX0OV91rHveFi8yfMuQ0vVRZCM.jpg","cast_id":18,"character":"A tourist","credit_id":"65454a3f9cc67b00df9290c0","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otto Preminger","original_name":"Otto Preminger","popularity":0.2887,"profile_path":"/zmJuWBIbWURkB138eD9IPVzpAUt.jpg","cast_id":19,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"65454a4c6beaea014b671111","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sig Ruman","original_name":"Sig Ruman","popularity":0.4057,"profile_path":"/r2iCgnjgF4dEyeRBWrqGL8qOQpd.jpg","cast_id":20,"character":"","credit_id":"65454a549cc67b013a3066dd","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Otto Preminger","original_name":"Otto Preminger","popularity":0.2887,"profile_path":"/zmJuWBIbWURkB138eD9IPVzpAUt.jpg","credit_id":"54b1a32f925141746c002716","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55694,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Herschel Burke Gilbert","original_name":"Herschel Burke Gilbert","popularity":0.0562,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"654549ca9cc67b00df92909b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2900,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carl Zuckmayer","original_name":"Carl Zuckmayer","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6545496c1ac29200c49605e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":261037,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"F.
