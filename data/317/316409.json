Moving between scathing realism and subtle irony, the film raises questions of belonging and uprooting, exile and emigration, home and family.  Meir Cohen is a decorated police officer yet he barely earns a living. His new assignment to deport African migrant workers teaches him that foreigners aren’t the only ones with no future in his country. Other plotlines intertwine with Meir’s story: an Israeli-Filipino boy fighting for recognition; a taxi driver whose children are migrating to a distant country; and a veteran migrant worker who’s forced to decide whether to leave or to hide until trouble passes.","popularity":0.0981,"poster_path":"/6erKz7Lk4B0KSFaJXhHePtEnM46.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2014-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manpower","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410943,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shmulik Calderone","original_name":"Shmulik Calderone","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"54af2e8ac3a3683fba002c74","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1297134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yossi Marshek","original_name":"Yossi Marshak","popularity":0.1182,"profile_path":"/c2d75wOfGBfTLjm6qVan9hHfKu2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"54af2e9c925141152c002a90","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pampas Shimon Udi","original_name":"Pampas Shimon Udi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"54af2ea6c3a368774400134b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sun Intusap","original_name":"Sun Intusap","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"54af2eaec3a368399e002fc0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liat Goren","original_name":"Liat Goren","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"54af2eb7925141152c002a96","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1410947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neta Shpigelman","original_name":"Neta Shpigelman","popularity":0.0871,"profile_path":"/1FTLsatF1VSHbFyOsJFFbiZW3CP.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"54af2ec1925141152c002a9a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herzl Tobey","original_name":"Herzl Tobey","popularity":0.1721,"profile_path":"/hfFtjUH5pZhVtz3744WddSTfsyL.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"54af2ecc9251414afd0008d0","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noam Kaplan","original_name":"Noam Kaplan","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54af2e739251411ef6002daf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410942,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noam Kaplan","original_name":"Noam Kaplan","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54af2e7ac3a3683fba002c6f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3247816","wikidata_id":"Q52837107","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6erKz7Lk4B0KSFaJXhHePtEnM46.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":717}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
