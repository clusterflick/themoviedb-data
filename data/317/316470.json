Pete Hothead was featured in only one other cartoon. In this one he receives a parrot from a store rather than the radio he ordered. In his attempts to exchange the parrot for a radio, he cause much havoc, disruptions and chaos in the store. He finally gets his radio, but then decides he'd rather have a television set.","popularity":0.2741,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1952-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pete Hothead","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerry Hausner","original_name":"Jerry Hausner","popularity":0.176,"profile_path":"/dHgJKJHJ7BTg698YlGRVFZSoa7G.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pete Hothead (voice)","credit_id":"54afc535c3a36877440022d6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1025569,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Phil Eastman","original_name":"Phil Eastman","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54afc52392514169e00040a4","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1035387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Scott","original_name":"Bill Scott","popularity":0.1212,"profile_path":"/51rKJ6TDIlaEPkor4Pfn8Ux7tga.jpg","credit_id":"54afc518c3a368399e00425b","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224802,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pete Burness","original_name":"Pete Burness","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54afc5039251414ae5001a06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151951","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1522,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fg7JLtqbR3SGJzPuNC5Vg24Mex0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2706}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
