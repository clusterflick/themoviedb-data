The syncopated medley of music, strange noises and varied eccentrics doing their special thing shares similarities with a fondly-recalled scene in cult film Delicatessen; though Delicatessen was yet to emerge when this short film first debuted. Rushes played in multiple festivals, including the prestigious Clermont-Ferrand. The soundtrack is by ex Techtones guitarist Steve Roach. Director Nicholas followed this with another oddball romp: his feature debut User Friendly.","popularity":0.0787,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rushes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1367739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Bartlett","original_name":"Christine Bartlett","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5424e4e00e0a263b74004dfe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1240890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Bland","original_name":"Carl Bland","popularity":0.2019,"profile_path":"/f4HdmbcbxR5iVq2P8UZTrGchN60.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5424e4fa0e0a263b6e004e26","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1367741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Fitchew","original_name":"David Fitchew","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5424e50dc3a368087a004e43","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":938945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregor Nicholas","original_name":"Gregor Nicholas","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5424e5480e0a263b84004db8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":938945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregor Nicholas","original_name":"Gregor Nicholas","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5424e5520e0a263b77004ebb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0216166","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
