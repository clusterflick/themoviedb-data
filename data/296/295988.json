Despite some false leads, he can shed light on the murky affair. A conventional but relatively exciting crime film that strives for atmospheric density but is not immune to the clichés of the genre. Charpentier's trivial novel is the first crime thriller in a series that pretends to be the publication of Commissioner Wilton's diaries.","popularity":0.4792,"poster_path":"/3Cbbla17mB9fKSUA9Bseohsjblf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1964-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das
