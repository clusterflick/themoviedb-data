They come across a wagon train bound for the town of Custer, where hundreds of people are gathering for a land rush in the Dakotas, which President Ulysses S. Grant has opened to settlers thanks to a treaty with the Sioux Indians. After the three rogues ride off, they spy a lone wagon with a tempting string of thoroughbreds. Before they can steal the horses, however, the wagon is attacked by a gang led by Layne Hunter, a shifty saloon owner from Custer. The trio chase off the gang, and as they are about to abscond with the horses, they find pretty Lee Carleton, whose father was killed in the attack.","popularity":1.3115,"poster_path":"/a93Y0XGy516ntHbucL9hbvzCbzK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1931-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Three lovable bad men, a jump ahead of the sheriff-finding thrilling adventures and fun in their search for gals and gold.","title":"Three Rogues","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Not Exactly Gentlemen","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Drei gef√§hrliche Gesellen","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"De tre Landevejsriddere","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor McLaglen","original_name":"Victor McLaglen","popularity":0.4535,"profile_path":"/vYj8mVtT8CgQOHH8eRNMl7pA7F1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bull Stanley","credit_id":"542c0894c3a36866a5000466","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fay Wray","original_name":"Fay Wray","popularity":0.5033,"profile_path":"/zE36ekZdFQ53Bvk5JauwIeOeKlR.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lee Carleton","credit_id":"542c08a00e0a265851000476","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lew Cody","original_name":"Lew Cody","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":"/mDq8vt8e6PZ1aX7KC8Xbs0ujr2I.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ace Beaudry","credit_id":"542c08abc3a368669b000401","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Warwick","original_name":"Robert Warwick","popularity":0.2401,"profile_path":"/dEOopjfb85VTKf0vRqBQtod550B.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Layne Hunter","credit_id":"542c08b80e0a26585300045c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89725,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce Compton","original_name":"Joyce Compton","popularity":0.4196,"profile_path":"/z5rRRN40OSWX1G5i5edvfqe56wv.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ace's girl","credit_id":"542c08fec3a36866a8000471","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Gribbon","original_name":"Eddie Gribbon","popularity":0.0898,"profile_path":"/acwju04aXg3SrDDinblKB5TBlok.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Bronco Dawson","credit_id":"542c08c30e0a26584c0004af","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1037770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Huntington","original_name":"Louise Huntington","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/703y6tR8Zjw53GQjeYeUub9grT4.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Bronco's girl","credit_id":"542c090b0e0a26585100047f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":975597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franklyn Farnum","original_name":"Franklyn Farnum","popularity":0.4916,"profile_path":"/tE9xlvLgA04icdBTe7rjqgt8c2E.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Nelson","credit_id":"542c0919c3a3686696000459","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Farley","original_name":"Jim Farley","popularity":0.4315,"profile_path":"/155ugk9VWe00T7wWSo3pqb9b80d.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Marshal Dunn","credit_id":"542c0934c3a368669b000419","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1369238,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Worth","original_name":"David Worth","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bruce Randall","credit_id":"542c08f0c3a368669b00040d","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1369239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Wines","original_name":"Carol Wines","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Bull's girl","credit_id":"542c09260e0a26585e000536","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Stoloff","original_name":"Benjamin Stoloff","popularity":0.167,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"542c08560e0a26584c0004a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157603,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William M.
