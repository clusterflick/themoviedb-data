From fighting the trends in the industry and taking on the challenges of the road as well as an unsympathetic media – to becoming an act that finally earned some respect.  In this movie, you'll get an insider's perspective of what has happened during the past 15 years.  Exclusive live shots, behind the scenes footage filmed by the band, individual interviews, and an insane rollercoaster ride around the world. The highs, the lows, the hangovers and the encores are all included in Jetlag – The Movie.  Will they become part of music history? Well, let's see after another 15 years or when rock 'n' roll is dead...  AND THAT IS SURE AS HELL AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN as long as the BACKYARD BABIES are around.  Buckle up and enjoy.","popularity":0.1798,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Backyard Babies: Jetlag - The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1793857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dregen","original_name":"Dregen","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":"/lHjYFgxh5jO2NHHqoM4GXndpQ37.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"58eccedf925141351f05d76f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1677114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicke Borg","original_name":"Nicke Borg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/zVnYRXbr1N8rYHBV6w2PN0eCjXT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"58eccef09251413ce403d8f5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1793858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johan Blomqvist","original_name":"Johan Blomqvist","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"58eccefcc3a36873020905d2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1793859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peder Carlsson","original_name":"Peder Carlsson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"58eccf08c3a36873020905d9","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
