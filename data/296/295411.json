Richie has a friend on the island, Gene, who is gregarious and mischievous. Like the more sensitive Richie, he too, was 19. During that summer of awakening he loses his youthful desires and develops his manhood. On the way to the movies, Richie literally bumps into Laura, an older woman who lives nearby. She asks him if he'll help her with some chores the following day. He is totally flustered, but agrees. Richie goes to her house and after knocking on the door, and getting no response, enters. On the floor he finds a crumpled telegram which reads, \"Your husband, Bob Hayes, has been killed in action.\" Laura appears, lonely and vulnerable. She moves toward him in a gesture of human contact. They slowly begin to dance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/cCgIS07fR75UhXdag1Vugjhysdm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every man should have a teacher.","title":"Summer of Laura","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1368462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marsha Moon","original_name":"Marsha Moon","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Laura","credit_id":"54287701c3a3680b3700324f","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":45007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Edwards","original_name":"Eric Edwards","popularity":3.247,"profile_path":"/NVfWLufRjMueposhVjwmZv0GuM.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Gene","credit_id":"58812866c3a368147d001de4","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2797077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hunter","original_name":"David Hunter","popularity":1.38,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Ritchie","credit_id":"5f73aa1521621b003629d4c9","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":107072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Madigan","original_name":"Helen Madigan","popularity":1.112,"profile_path":"/aO7IYCRpYAfxRPDdmnLvgBaqESa.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"June","credit_id":"5f73aa253503980034941e83","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":101149,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wade Nichols","original_name":"Wade Nichols","popularity":1.96,"profile_path":"/x99qcC0Bpp6MWCtpicW6tnWZV1a.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Bob","credit_id":"5f73aa30d388ae0035bc43a7","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":104546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Pope","original_name":"Kim Pope","popularity":3.844,"profile_path":"/blIIRgzcC9sgaRusXnWhLyQLQXb.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5f73aa35d55e4d003797bde1","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1368466,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stephen Colwell","original_name":"Stephen Colwell","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"542877ea0e0a26555f0031c0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":104539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erica Eaton","original_name":"Erica Eaton","popularity":2.174,"profile_path":"/gntMHnkiUMu2wNh1b8u8qTQ2g2e.jpg","credit_id":"5a60831cc3a368786b013c03","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":107071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Davidson","original_name":"David Davidson","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d0685e303c8500c6143ef2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":107071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Davidson","original_name":"David Davidson","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64d06865303c850100b1802a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0195319","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cCgIS07fR75UhXdag1Vugjhysdm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
