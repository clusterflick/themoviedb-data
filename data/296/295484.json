Slight of frame, but large in spirit and vision, the 70-year-old artist was born in China, lives in Philadelphia, and now, as constant traveler, the world is her canvas. Our film explores two sides of Lily's life that are connected parts of the same journey: her international ventures helping to heal weakened spirits in communities around the world and a personal journey within, to repair her own fractured family.","popularity":0.0432,"poster_path":"/oGJcPWdTtj4jExkjaZoqVq6wEtM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RW","name":"Rwanda"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"}],"release_date":"2014-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Barefoot Artist","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1368614,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Traub","original_name":"Daniel Traub","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/m87DsUamv6KYuFZKPsdt8twwwKA.jpg","credit_id":"54291a970e0a26556c004969","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1039287,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Glenn Holsten","original_name":"Glenn Holsten","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54291a860e0a265575004907","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2776638","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oGJcPWdTtj4jExkjaZoqVq6wEtM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
