From the foggy shores of Newfoundland to the steaming jungles of Zanzibar we will see where the Nightmare has left its mark. Hear from those who have survived the experience, and the families of those that did not. Meet the scientists, psychologists, and folklorists on the front lines of the battle for understanding how something without material form can traumatize and even kill those that encounter it. THE NIGHTMARE is a fascinating exploration of a phenomenon that suggests that the only difference between hallucination and the supernatural...is belief.","popularity":0.4073,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nightmare","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Gray","original_name":"Adam Gray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator/Himself","credit_id":"56365841c3a3681b5201a9e8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Gray","original_name":"Adam Gray","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563656d9c3a3681b6101bb2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1143572,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Gray","original_name":"Andrew Gray","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56365770c3a3681b5c01cb96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":933688,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Stephens","original_name":"Paul Stephens","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563657a4c3a3681b5401c156","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1504169,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joan Jenkinson","original_name":"Joan Jenkinson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563657d0c3a3681b5401c15d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1530323,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rob Spence","original_name":"Rob Spence","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"563657fa92514129fe00d257","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1530324,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sean Fritz","original_name":"Sean Fritz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5636580bc3a3681b4b0193ba","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3030,"name":"nightmare"},{"id":2116,"name":"sleep"},{"id":5859,"name":"paralysis"},{"id":161173,"name":"succubus"},{"id":200969,"name":"incubus"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
