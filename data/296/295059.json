His creation was an installation for two screens that was presented within the scope for the 1995 exhibition The World of Photography. The work Schnittstelle developed out of that installation. Reflecting on Farocki's own documentary work, it examines the question of what it means to work with existing images rather than producing one's own, new images. The title plays on the double meaning of 'Schnitt', referring both to Farocki's workplace, the editing table, as well as the 'human-machine interface', where a person operates a computer using a keyboard and a mouse.","popularity":0.0994,"poster_path":"/2KXmbr5Yh7uHgVbl2GvsoAcoCss.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43265,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harun Farocki Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1995-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Interface","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Interface","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harun Farocki","original_name":"Harun Farocki","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/qTMJH2Vq91rbsAGrk6AbsKeBnHY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5424bc32c3a368088700435d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harun Farocki","original_name":"Harun Farocki","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/qTMJH2Vq91rbsAGrk6AbsKeBnHY.jpg","credit_id":"5424bbcac3a36808760046bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harun Farocki","original_name":"Harun Farocki","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/qTMJH2Vq91rbsAGrk6AbsKeBnHY.jpg","credit_id":"65983050a698cf07ac439ffe","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583308,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ingo Kratisch","original_name":"Ingo Kratisch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659830585cc11d78a37d7cd0","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2729945,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Max Reimann","original_name":"Max Reimann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6598306e60c51d01e4978860","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2333,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harun Farocki","original_name":"Harun Farocki","popularity":0.1326,"profile_path":"/qTMJH2Vq91rbsAGrk6AbsKeBnHY.jpg","credit_id":"6598307f726fb14f55ab285c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0269834","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/2KXmbr5Yh7uHgVbl2GvsoAcoCss.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/rhzs3okhavXK092EcVB1zEezEjw.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"3sat","release_date":"1995-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
