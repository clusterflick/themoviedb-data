Pam, Tommy and Tammy are all played by Trecartin, who, wearing his signature make-up, jumps back and forth between male and female roles. Totally self-absorbed and equipped with vestigial attention spans, the characters are constantly communicating with one another on the phone or online.","popularity":0.0402,"poster_path":"/xStNHVDcwgHHC73riDDvnbpwxgc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20988,"logo_path":null,"name":"Electronic Arts Intermix","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"(Tommy-Chat Just E-mailed Me.)","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Tommy Chat just e-mailed me.","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lizzie Fitch","original_name":"Lizzie Fitch","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/dUZ9QJ1RX2z5ehogZnDVbs6ZsKM.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Beth and Bolivia","credit_id":"54249e950e0a263b81004435","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Trecartin","original_name":"Ryan Trecartin","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/iWJgI83UpTedOiZFXvNf8iHWVdC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Tammy 1/Tammy 2/Tommy Chat/High-Low Tommy Video Voice","credit_id":"54249e9d0e0a263b740044a8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3044329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taya Kaschnick","original_name":"Taya Kaschnick","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Catherine Pimples and OMG 1","credit_id":"606f9f1f68929c0079775064","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3044330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Penelope Wright","original_name":"Penelope Wright","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Penny-O","credit_id":"606f9f4b68929c0058ffaba1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3044332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barkev G.","original_name":"Barkev G.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"OMG record me Dude","credit_id":"606f9f6212b10e0059a59983","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998404,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rhett LaRue","original_name":"Rhett LaRue","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/kRQzcuJMYes7taq1Gs8NavQ3af5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Cheeta","credit_id":"606f9f7381da3900574fedcd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3044334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Junior Greenberg","original_name":"Junior Greenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"The Cat","credit_id":"606f9f8512b10e00299bff57","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3044336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lexar","original_name":"Lexar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Soft Picture Boy","credit_id":"606f9f9c12b10e0040a10e21","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Trecartin","original_name":"Ryan Trecartin","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/iWJgI83UpTedOiZFXvNf8iHWVdC.jpg","credit_id":"606f9eb3c525c400781b1ecb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Trecartin","original_name":"Ryan Trecartin","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/iWJgI83UpTedOiZFXvNf8iHWVdC.jpg","credit_id":"606f9eba9979d200401d450a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ryan Trecartin","original_name":"Ryan Trecartin","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/iWJgI83UpTedOiZFXvNf8iHWVdC.jpg","credit_id":"54249f56c3a368087a0044da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5866408","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":918,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zBVNUETzfaZxgLcYKBWQ95hXTO8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":612},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xStNHVDcwgHHC73riDDvnbpwxgc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: YouTube","release_date":"2006-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
