The patrons of a late-19th Century America theater flock to see the latest production, a Western tale of redemption. Johnny Laredo, a middle-aged gunfighter fleeing his many enemies by traveling at night, stops briefly at the campfire of Tim Dawson's team of cattle drivers for a cup of coffee and a bit of human companionship. Dawson offers Laredo a job, but Laredo is afraid to return to Wyoming where he killed a number of men. Stopping in a small Texas town for supplies before heading across the Mexican border, the gunfighter is forced to fight a inexperienced youngster trying to make a reputation and kills him. Even though he is acquitted, the gunfighter has had enough and returns to Dawson, accepts the job, and hopefully, the opportunity for redemption.","popularity":0.6862,"poster_path":"/iWLbeMq0yCFbh30MnvkyMYzfCUz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Night Rider","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Cash","original_name":"Johnny Cash","popularity":0.6074,"profile_path":"/8vIbqfss0GYh0ZgnfwE1ynzea6c.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Johnny Laredo","credit_id":"542b13b10e0a261266000283","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":993495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Western","original_name":"Johnny Western","popularity":0.0497,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Marty","credit_id":"542b16980e0a2612530002c8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":121082,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Merle Travis","original_name":"Merle Travis","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Kentucky","credit_id":"542b16f0c3a368118b0002de","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dickie Jones","original_name":"Dickie Jones","popularity":0.2796,"profile_path":"/ingaYYtcJZoiMtfXNTgABzPl5nu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Billy Joe","credit_id":"548f3d2192514122ed007abb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":168050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Hinn","original_name":"Michael Hinn","popularity":0.1272,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mr. Gallaway","credit_id":"6037a5eb15959f003f8721da","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":165545,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Whitey Hughes","original_name":"Whitey Hughes","popularity":0.0873,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Bartender Pete","credit_id":"6037a5f94fd1410040af1d0c","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":168050,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Hinn","original_name":"Michael Hinn","popularity":0.1272,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6037a588afa1b00043a758bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0228641","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":927,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xV25KWtgRJRrafTDbySJVFLmjxX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1648}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1866,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iWLbeMq0yCFbh30MnvkyMYzfCUz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1244}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":197125,"name":"western x"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1962-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
