THACO is the story of four nerds in their 30s - adults, but not grown up - who never quite get around to the dungeon adventure on game night.

They go over the games that have affected, infected, and generally warped their minds - and they wouldn't have it any other way.","popularity":0.5279,"poster_path":"/A5ojSzESMkXFKE3lFr57aqj2YXB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Get Your Geek On!","title":"Thaco","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Kesher","original_name":"Aaron Kesher","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Aaron","credit_id":"5429188e0e0a2655620049e5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Stark Olsen","original_name":"Jon Stark Olsen","popularity":0.0582,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jon","credit_id":"542918a60e0a26556f004a8d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368612,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bill Stiteler","original_name":"Bill Stiteler","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bill","credit_id":"542918bb0e0a2655750048d8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368613,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derek \"Duck\" Washington","original_name":"Derek \"Duck\" Washington","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Duck","credit_id":"542918d90e0a265566004975","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23446,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neil Gaiman","original_name":"Neil Gaiman","popularity":0.9074,"profile_path":"/wXPREg2zhD9gsycde7AoMebVyfA.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"542918e90e0a26556c00493a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368679,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amanda Kudalis","original_name":"Amanda Kudalis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54295caec3a36806bf000916","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368612,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bill Stiteler","original_name":"Bill Stiteler","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54295b540e0a26556c0050c2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368677,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amanda Kudalis","original_name":"Amanda Kudalis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54295c230e0a26556c0050d7","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368678,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amanda Kudalis","original_name":"Amanda Kudalis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54295c3b0e0a26556c0050df","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368681,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ryland Cronk","original_name":"Ryland Cronk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54295d04c3a36806c1000967","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368680,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"TJ Kudalis","original_name":"TJ Kudalis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54295ce10e0a26556200515e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368612,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bill Stiteler","original_name":"Bill Stiteler","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54295b8dc3a36806b30009ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1408329","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.724,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A5ojSzESMkXFKE3lFr57aqj2YXB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":543}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5801,"name":"nerd"},{"id":10439,"name":"gamer"},{"id":18360,"name":"role playing game"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Thac0: The Movie - The Trailer","key":"thBTpqjDbFg","published_at":"2008-07-17T17:42:10.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"54295e2f0e0a26555f00537f"}]}}}
