From his earliest childhood onwards, the 13-year old has been shunted from one care home to another. When his mother has to go to prison, he is sent to his father, whom he has never known. The man turns out to be a dead loss, a warehouseman who's given up on life, a man in his mid-40s who still lives with his Moroccan parents in a high-rise block in the banlieue. Benjamin's turbulence and violence soon prove too much for his new family.","popularity":0.3407,"poster_path":"/2L4obz0E34b5iuNNt2JVRPbJc68.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Commune Image Média","origin_country":""},{"id":98235,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Vingt-Cinquième Heure","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":98236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Président Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"2014-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fevers","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1376334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Didier Michon","original_name":"Didier Michon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Benjamin","credit_id":"54466eed0e0a26632d00b021","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slimane Dazi","original_name":"Slimane Dazi","popularity":0.1497,"profile_path":"/tHh9XviWroQWkKOa2jRPh5EkHTW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Karim Zeroubi","credit_id":"54466ef70e0a26633a00b128","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1376335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Farida Amrouche","original_name":"Farida Amrouche","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":"/p1hEBP1tpYUDCAzH2napvuIK4cd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Zohra Zeroubi","credit_id":"54466f000e0a26632d00b026","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emilia Derou-Bernal","original_name":"Emilia Derou-Bernal","popularity":0.081,"profile_path":"/hpV1ieSg14rrXLSpBLxJXNPiv0o.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"L’assistante Sociale","credit_id":"54466f0bc3a3683e0100b0c9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lounès Tazairt","original_name":"Lounès Tazairt","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":"/A3QexrYH5nmF1pZzQoRcht8CpcL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Abdelkader Zeroubi","credit_id":"54466f18c3a368277b002668","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1360309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Harrisson","original_name":"Tony Harrisson","popularity":0.103,"profile_path":"/jYquCKooaT5eTGVghrQvCVMc2p0.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Claude","credit_id":"54466f27c3a3683e0500ad27","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascal Elso","original_name":"Pascal Elso","popularity":0.2148,"profile_path":"/tE8FylEfUeyzqNpGVjGNYw7iyq4.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Nounours","credit_id":"5a2ac909c3a3680b9612828f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125108,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohamed Aroussi","original_name":"Mohamed Aroussi","popularity":0.1246,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Heikel Zeroubi","credit_id":"5a2ac94b9251410333124be0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alain Azerot","original_name":"Alain Azerot","popularity":0.1379,"profile_path":"/nUPBE8sMzkVMgjnfBt1goztQzT3.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"M.
