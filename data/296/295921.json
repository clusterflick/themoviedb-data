At the center of the action is Jimmy Mahoney (Richard Cassilly), a logger who stumbles onto the city of Mahagonny, where (almost) anything is allowed. Teresa Stratas gives a mesmerizing performance as Jenny, the prostitute who takes up with Jimmy, until he is executed for the greatest of all crimes in Mahagonny—to not have any money. The legendary Astrid Varnay, in her final Met appearances, is Leocadia Begbick, and Cornell MacNeil sings Trinity Moses.","popularity":0.2761,"poster_path":"/ePqo5VhUFrl6yHgoI6jGkfBwMr2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1979-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":147,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Weill: Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny","type":"Full DVD Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1945081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Cassilly","original_name":"Richard Cassilly","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jimmy Mahoney","credit_id":"5bbb1ed5c3a368241b046c88","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Stratas","original_name":"Teresa Stratas","popularity":0.1344,"profile_path":"/oX1TpVAs5Vadqcx4wz1oBIvtE6h.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jenny","credit_id":"5bbb1edb0e0a2634f90427e8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cornell MacNeil","original_name":"Cornell MacNeil","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/r3kK1M40aoCg21q8GWMik6EmaHF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Trinity Moses","credit_id":"5bbb1ee20e0a2616ad00d49b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2145123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Astrid Varnay","original_name":"Astrid Varnay","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/bspzL8RKJk1BZhsE6t7t6Zpw7j1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Begbick","credit_id":"5bbb1ee9c3a368242f03c493","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248678,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Levine","original_name":"James Levine","popularity":0.1985,"profile_path":"/p6ujBSZMKTc2zNCytIvvg9NKL1D.jpg","credit_id":"5bbb1ecb0e0a2616a700d7bf","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Large","original_name":"Brian Large","popularity":0.137,"profile_path":"/fwMu0qHur53enoBapRcjpKw7Ydq.jpg","credit_id":"5fd9ade8226c56003f3ebba0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134331,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kurt Weill","original_name":"Kurt Weill","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/dGjnOHvc0ia0qWMMJizHBwouriG.jpg","credit_id":"5fd598f75ed9620041e1db78","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11630,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bertolt Brecht","original_name":"Bertolt Brecht","popularity":0.2837,"profile_path":"/cFfD5goJjn9fZ5opYbHoSzDBxsZ.jpg","credit_id":"5fd598438c40f700402c83b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2049572","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eiYl21odW4cvMvBp3vYFlPQ7vTR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ePqo5VhUFrl6yHgoI6jGkfBwMr2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
