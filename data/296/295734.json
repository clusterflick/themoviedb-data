They get sent to Panipat, a sleepy town and the only place in the world that wants them, recycling them back into yarn. Reshma is a bright, inquisitive woman working in a textile recycling factory in small time India, who dreams of travelling the vast distances the clothes she handles have. While Reshma shows us how these garments get transformed, she and other women workers reflect on these clothes. Despite limited exposure to western culture, they construct a picture of how the West is, using both their imagination and the rumours that travel with the cast-offs.","popularity":0.1876,"poster_path":"/9ahDB4j7wGdoHEI8oZ1wTDSPeKu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100563,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soul Rebel Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unravel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1369227,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meghna Gupta","original_name":"Meghna Gupta","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"542bfd6b0e0a265851000338","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2567427,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gigi Berardi","original_name":"Gigi Berardi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c44dfa2ac49900191e2292","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2276053","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":759,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xbNpiGHtvsk7cOgaeNGkfFn38FW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1350}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":759,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9ahDB4j7wGdoHEI8oZ1wTDSPeKu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14636,"name":"india"},{"id":156388,"name":"environmentalism"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
