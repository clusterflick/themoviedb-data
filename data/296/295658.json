It's five years later, and Bobby's appeals have all but run out, and the Austin Steers are - once again - on the march to the Superbowl, with a lock on the playoffs, when their wide receiver has a season ending injury. With their playoff hopes in shambles, the Governor of Texas controversially offers Bobby a furlough -- from death row -- to help rescue the Steers' post-season hopes, and even play in the Superbowl.","popularity":2.9747,"poster_path":"/fwx7qMEMloLgaEM3JhqwLMADMbA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
