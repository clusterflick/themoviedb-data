At Frank's request, the spiritualist later performs for the elder Clayton a seance during which Rita impersonates the late Mrs. Clayton and arranges for a reconciliation between Frank and his father. Rita falls in love with Bob, however, and, in order to protect Bob's interests against Frank's, exposes the spiritualist as a faker. Frank is disgraced in his father's eyes, and Bob quickly forgives Rita for her past complicity in Frank's schemes.","popularity":0.3651,"poster_path":"/kp5bbO22vXxGcw4ReLh73MTUaK3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Faker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":142596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacqueline Logan","original_name":"Jacqueline Logan","popularity":0.2639,"profile_path":"/s4Qj6cXT7DAFjX76agXrJzZ1UVH.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rita Martin","credit_id":"542d6be7c3a36845ec001e58","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Delaney","original_name":"Charles Delaney","popularity":0.1055,"profile_path":"/8KR8oUaVFOo4xt9pnlXThZjff4N.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bob Williams","credit_id":"542d6bed0e0a2607ab001eb4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warner Oland","original_name":"Warner Oland","popularity":0.3413,"profile_path":"/1WZmRVQsfjK8hwzbnaIy6WK41fr.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hadrian","credit_id":"542d6bf30e0a2607a4001ed6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Hill Mailes","original_name":"Charles Hill Mailes","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/At3GtUXi9WLKero09JGxxVCY6Ph.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hadrian","credit_id":"542d6bfa0e0a26079e00206b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaston Glass","original_name":"Gaston Glass","popularity":0.129,"profile_path":"/hvhtpjt0hieax7KRKJfuEUJ2OVy.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Frank Clayton","credit_id":"542d6c02c3a36845d5001f58","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":998697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flora Finch","original_name":"Flora Finch","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":"/r1Af5GrRy6uKDRwsWTxrsitpmIy.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Emma","credit_id":"542d6c08c3a36845de001fae","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lon Poff","original_name":"Lon Poff","popularity":0.123,"profile_path":"/jakJAU1B1IM4h4tR9L3smVSBAhN.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Hadiran's Aid","credit_id":"542d6c260e0a2607a4001edb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Kelsey","original_name":"Fred Kelsey","popularity":0.1849,"profile_path":"/cNLIBwSJZJzE2k4XfYdwPXdsds0.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Police Detective","credit_id":"542d6c30c3a36845cf001eeb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1329663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Mir","original_name":"David Mir","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Believer","credit_id":"628bd0e61a32481799e9acb5","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Rosen","original_name":"Phil Rosen","popularity":0.4767,"profile_path":"/oA7r2vrVNAg27bTIJSVEItZA33w.jpg","credit_id":"542d6bc7c3a36845d5001f50","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103444,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Howard J.
