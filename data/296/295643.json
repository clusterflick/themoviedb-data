Suchet is embarking on a journey to learn more about the woman who created Poirot and whose books remain outsold only by Shakespeare and the Bible. Suchet's journey takes him to the places Christie lived, the landscapes that inspired her and to meetings with people who knew the woman behind the fame and those inspired by her extraordinary legacy. He explores the close links between Christie's extraordinary life and her work and discovers what it was about the woman from a small seaside town that allowed her to become the best-selling murder mystery writer in history.","popularity":0.212,"poster_path":"/d8NeeBomuIMpURgkvS1EeU3WSoI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The extraordinary life of the creator of Poirot and Miss Marple","title":"The Mystery of Agatha Christie, With David Suchet","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"David Suchet: The Mystery of Agatha Christie","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Suchet","original_name":"David Suchet","popularity":0.8518,"profile_path":"/4X4TT8Uf8mAmRIYgYh4EeR4mWva.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self -
