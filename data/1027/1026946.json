He is a street trumpeter and part-time guest on a local rock radio station. Richard Peterson fills his world with obsessions, like \"Sea Hunt\" (and the \"Son of Sea Hunt,\" Jeff Bridges), the \"The Golden Age of Television\" production music (which inspires four albums/CDs produced with help from the Seattle music scene), stalking local TV celebrities, and a fanatical interest in Johnny Mathis. The unique relationship between Richard and Mathis is the catalyst for one of Richard's most remarkable compositions, \"Love on the Golf Course\". Between street gigs and a stint as a piano player in a grunge club, mega-band \" The Stone Temple Pilots\" discovers Richard's music. Richard's moment in the spotlight is short-lived when he is confronted by the human cost of obsessions, revealing the dark family secret he has lived with his entire life.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big City Dick: Richard Peterson's First Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0397041","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Slamdance Film Festival","release_date":"2004-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"USA Film Festival","release_date":"2004-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Coney Island Film Festival","release_date":"2004-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BIG CITY DICK: RICHARD PETERSON'S FIRST MOVIE","key":"NnNCYLyBMfQ","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2017-11-10T15:37:53.000Z","id":"632b462aef9d72009219d828"}]}}}
