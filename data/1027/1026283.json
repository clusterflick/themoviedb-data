We look at how the Queen has worn the crown during an era in which her country and her people changed beyond all recognition. From politics and the economy to industry and technology, our working life to our family life, from what we eat to how we dress, how we spend our money, and what we do in our free time.  We see how Elizabeth II was no bystander during these great moments of social change, but someone who often led the way, reflecting and engaging with the critical moments in our post-war history.  We reveal how, during these shifting times, not only did we change, but the Queen did too, her time echoed our transformation, the crown moving with the ages.  We hear how Elizabeth II became a fixed focal point for many during these changing times; an anchor for the country - someone people looked to","popularity":0.1951,"poster_path":"/uLdPTL3PNONjubAmSK8SwJMkY20.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80893,"logo_path":"/hFzOkuR4FoZE1U1hvuojMp4Qfxa.png","name":"BBC Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Longest Reign: The Queen and Her People","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mishal Husain","original_name":"Mishal Husain","popularity":0.0844,"profile_path":"/9tywPaRdKcWKIJ6TXPQlaW2kelJ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"6328d30d1f98d1007be02fbd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":558240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom","original_name":"Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom","popularity":0.4598,"profile_path":"/rO3H0ndtekEtNzRScYQMREiB3gI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6328d32d2d3721007f0b9846","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3707385,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Giles","original_name":"James Giles","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6328d4fbef9d72009218e76a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902406,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michelle Clinton","original_name":"Michelle Clinton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6328d5546af9dd007fc61faa","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zaXiyRXOcrpADXQI6zFeNedFJEB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uLdPTL3PNONjubAmSK8SwJMkY20.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"The Longest Reign: The Queen and Her People","release_date":"2022-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
