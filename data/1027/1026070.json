Describing the affinity he developed for work operating at the intersection of film materiality and personal language, Dorsky explains how he developed his philosophy of the “devotional film” and the “microcosmic viewer.”  Dorsky likens his practice to Buddhist sculpture, referring to himself as a “Japanese poet continuing aspects of the ethos of the Marxist revolution.” In the interview, the artist describes his use of the screen as an “altarpiece for the image” and emphasizes his use of editing to create works which “harmoniously coalesce.”  Interview conducted by Jeffrey Skoller in May 2000, edited in 2014.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":97427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Video Data Bank","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nathaniel Dorsky: An Interview","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1071582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathaniel Dorsky","original_name":"Nathaniel Dorsky","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/dhJc7fXL8eQovtm6wMQb9cQZY7j.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6327d4630f21c6007faa4706","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2099778,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jeffrey Skoller","original_name":"Jeffrey Skoller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Interviewer","credit_id":"6327d478bc2cb30083344d5e","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3706433,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Liz Miller","original_name":"Liz Miller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6327d4cb2d531a007de679b1","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3706434,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Charles Rice","original_name":"Charles Rice","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6327d4d92d531a009104e63b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":293336,"name":"experimental film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
