Round the clock they toil, often thanklessly, to keep the monarchy humming. They iron the Queen's sheets, polish Philip's riding boots, squeeze Charles's toothpaste and walk the royal corgis. Privy to the monarchy's most intimate secrets, they are its biggest asset and greatest liability.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Serving The Royals: Inside The Firm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10150584","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c3PTukm0Ns9KjRTdxgK5K2tqZwy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2400}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
