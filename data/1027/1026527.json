He draws parallels between cooking and composing, noting how both involve the skilful combination of ingredients and how they share the common purpose of bringing pleasure to many. Rick also explains why he thinks the music of Verdi, Rossini and Puccini are linked to the food of the regions where they lived and worked.","popularity":0.0527,"poster_path":"/2H2MniTSQ599LFG52lD8Y91vNnj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"意大利歌剧制作与美食","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1225236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rick Stein","original_name":"Rick Stein","popularity":0.0888,"profile_path":"/xxWd3kNTT82sbf7MYqH281CM3ZU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6329cec9caab6d008204d115","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oZOoWIiytEGLVwfG1g96C9KcWKw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":990,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2H2MniTSQ599LFG52lD8Y91vNnj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":660}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
