Until 2016 he was a factory worker. In that year he became a member of Platform TU in Mariupol. The organization's mission is to promote human rights and freedoms through an inclusive culture and modern art and to develop critical thinking and tolerance in Ukrainian society. Platform TU became one of the few independent art spaces in Eastern Ukraine, where underground culture, innovative ideas, human rights, and freedoms are dominant values. The short film 'Without Inspiration' was made in April 2022, especially for Art Collection Telekom in western Ukraine, where the family has found a temporary shelter.","popularity":0.0386,"poster_path":"/p0YqMe6JRJtAfIR6EHF1l72yMN2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Without Inspiration","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3375584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Surovtsov","original_name":"Oleksandr Surovtsov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"632827fcbbd0b0007f577ac9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3706785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yulia Surotsova","original_name":"Yulia Surotsova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6328282620af7700998b8913","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3375584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Surovtsov","original_name":"Oleksandr Surovtsov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6328277024f2ce00902c6d29","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3375584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Surovtsov","original_name":"Oleksandr Surovtsov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6328278953866e008f0565be","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3375584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Surovtsov","original_name":"Oleksandr Surovtsov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63282799dcb6a3007dd9e749","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3375584,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oleksandr Surovtsov","original_name":"Oleksandr Surovtsov","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632827e3bc2cb30080680bda","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":760,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p0YqMe6JRJtAfIR6EHF1l72yMN2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
