There’s Mary who is happily in love with Toby, Toby who is sort of indifferent about Mary, Joby who has a secret crush on Toby, Caty who is single and satisfied and Freddy, the gang’s own enthusiastic nerd.  Freddy tells his friends about an ancient greek myth which suggests that humanity used to consist of people who were literally stuck together with their true loves. He then suggests that they should all pray to the old god Zeus so that Mary and Toby are reunited in their true form. Caty finds this suggestion repulsive but to her horror the others consider it to be a charming idea.  The ritual works… but maybe not in the way they intended.","popularity":0.2947,"poster_path":"/tem6ysdCOpk6Qs2bvYtI0oG6Cso.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2021-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love
