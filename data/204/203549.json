He captures wild horses supposedly to sell for hides but uses them to transport the bills across the border. Police captain Juan Reyes (Richard Avonde) is posing as a bandit to uncover the counterfeiters smuggling fake pesos into Mexico, and is assisted by feisty youngsters Red (Michael Chapin) and Judy (Eilene Janssen), who are trying to protect the wild horses being used by the gang. The kids suspect that rancher Big John Harkins (Roy Barcroft) is the leader of the gang and that he is forcing Mexican artist Espinosa (Julian Rivero) to help him.","popularity":0.7698,"poster_path":"/mw3RudZA5EFM9F3stFK7sGYhwHi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Horse Ambush","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":126898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Chapin","original_name":"Michael Chapin","popularity":0.1227,"profile_path":"/k8NXYRPkfSvSYTMVUzK82aBJxxy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Red","credit_id":"52fe4cdfc3a368484e1cab3f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":199128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eilene Janssen","original_name":"Eilene Janssen","popularity":0.1845,"profile_path":"/130yJZwSCTDZp374RFGtL25HKIp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Judy","credit_id":"52fe4cdfc3a368484e1cab43","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":186359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Avonde","original_name":"Richard Avonde","popularity":0.1614,"profile_path":"/yu56n1tFfwfJT8mdN4XqHmlQP7A.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Juan Reyes (aka Jalisco)","credit_id":"52fe4cdfc3a368484e1cab47","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Bell","original_name":"James Bell","popularity":0.1367,"profile_path":"/eu2oR1riKippv4xti7ERynzNCEP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sheriff Tom White","credit_id":"52fe4cdfc3a368484e1cab4b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Barcroft","original_name":"Roy Barcroft","popularity":0.3467,"profile_path":"/57EKCVAOfcNKNNcHBtkmp0cU9od.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Harkins","credit_id":"52fe4cdfc3a368484e1cab4f","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":939707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Movita","original_name":"Movita","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":"/qxmAEb98j963LqkniIEqsCrxkQn.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lita Espinosa","credit_id":"52fe4cdfc3a368484e1cab53","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":161702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Rivero","original_name":"Julian Rivero","popularity":0.098,"profile_path":"/9HYOXMH3RRAGp02NyND8IyjSMzj.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Enrico Espinosa","credit_id":"52fe4cdfc3a368484e1cab57","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Lee","original_name":"Scott Lee","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Henchman Shorty","credit_id":"5887ae1d925141630600227a","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1744592,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drake Smith","original_name":"Drake Smith","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Henchman Mace Gary","credit_id":"5887ae2cc3a36859f00020cb","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":168101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Montoya","original_name":"Alex Montoya","popularity":0.2899,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Pedro","credit_id":"58accb77c3a3682a7a000ba6","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Daheim","original_name":"John Daheim","popularity":0.2956,"profile_path":"/ci3PxMl0yKHurPcrMo79vBFrw21.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Henchman Turk","credit_id":"58accb839251411f88000d18","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Cooper","original_name":"Ted Cooper","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Spy","credit_id":"58accb8d9251411f84000d81","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":160426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne Burson","original_name":"Wayne Burson","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Henchman Tom","credit_id":"58accb9a9251411f8c000c55","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":195914,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Lively","original_name":"William Lively","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cdfc3a368484e1cab5d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33955,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred C.
