He was particularly pleased with a final guitar solo (with a vibrating horizontal line) and double bass solo (with a stomping vertical line). For this film Lye did not have to include any advertising slogans; friends at the Tourist and Industrial Development Association, shocked to learn that Lye and his family had become destitute, arranged for TIDA to sponsor the film – to the horror of government bureaucrats who could not understand why a popular dance was being treated as a tourist attraction. - Harvard Film Archive","popularity":0.2328,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1940-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swinging the Lambeth Walk","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":19,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ランベス・ウォークで踊ろう","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Len Lye","original_name":"Len Lye","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/rGNL1Bzvje4x7wWxtapS3en2NVO.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cd8c3a368484e1c97f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0033123","wikidata_id":"Q69547199","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nOZuJmvEaazmge9oihqOOxNPOZM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285318,"name":"paint on film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1940-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MTV - Len Lye - Swinging the lambeth walk","key":"4NRdGOznfgk","published_at":"2012-08-14T18:31:32.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"5a5fdf7bc3a368776600af77"}]}}}
