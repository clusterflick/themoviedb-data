The farmer is outraged and banishes Sugarfoot from the farm. Sugarfoot is determined to make the money needed to buy his master a new tractor, and he becomes a movie-double for a screen Wonder Horse of the Movies, and makes enough money to buy a new tractor. The farmer forgives him and, as a reward, takes him to the movies, where Sugarfoot sees the star-horse getting all the credit for all of Sugarfoot's stunt-doubling.","popularity":0.0661,"poster_path":"/t8Gwgtz9tjCVjSszh7ScVYtGf88.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":"/x6HLTQILKcImVQ3GvVCwy35W5fz.png","name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1954-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Horse's Tale","video":false,"vote_average":5.25,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932741,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Paul J.
