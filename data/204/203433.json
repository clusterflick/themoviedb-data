And Out","overview":"In the 1980s, a filmmaker begins a project to record the life of an average kid. In Perry, Ohio, he picks Rich Longfellow, a shy lad, and begins filming. Soon after, he dies in Mozambique. Sixteen years later, his son continues the project, finding Rich, now 23, in L.A., with dreams of being a Shakespearean actor, getting experience in porn films. We meet Betsy, Rich's sensible girlfriend, Lee, the impatient producer, and Carmichael, a director with artistic pretensions who inspires Rich. Problems with Besty and tension on the set bring Rich to a crisis; when his boyhood friend starts a Shakespeare company that tours nursing homes in the San Fernando Valley, Rich sees a way out.","popularity":0.3946,"poster_path":"/x2xRrP5IjaSlTlaLR7KL30BQuzo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3052,"logo_path":"/kqP7DC8cUCzDSI5SXiJKJKmQg1K.png","name":"Troma Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":40861,"logo_path":null,"name":"Water & Light Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The \"Spinal Tap\" of the porno industry!","title":"Shakespeare In...
