He returned to the material in 1980 but died before it was completed. His assistant Steven Jones finished the film under the supervision of Lye’s widow Ann, who had been closely involved with all of Lye’s American films. - Harvard Film Archive","popularity":0.2357,"poster_path":"/7vviRIOdZTFVh4oFJpCPlzhoVH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tal Farlow","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"タル・ファーロウ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Len Lye","original_name":"Len Lye","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/rGNL1Bzvje4x7wWxtapS3en2NVO.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cd8c3a368484e1c9817","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2621702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tal Farlow","original_name":"Tal Farlow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64cfa20d4d6791011c17b4eb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0052269","wikidata_id":"Q69625777","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7vviRIOdZTFVh4oFJpCPlzhoVH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220286,"name":"scratch film"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
