The film combines footage from a beauty contest, religious procession, failed airflight, automotive and science experiments, animal experimentation, skyscraper construction, military paraphernalia, John D. Rockefeller and scenes of leisure, Richard Nixon and scenes of war, blimps and hot air balloons, and a sword swallower. Lipsett envisioned his film as a kind of cinematic time capsule for future generations.","popularity":1.0918,"poster_path":"/wIY2juOeUxSixtXFWBuDpRYXZgY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1966-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Additional Material for a Time-Capsule","title":"A Trip Down Memory Lane","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Additional Material for a Time-capsule","type":"subtitle"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Lipsett","original_name":"Arthur Lipsett","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":"/uL09XjFi6fMHC0VhFZvIhOgVtN5.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cdec3a368484e1ca699","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Lipsett","original_name":"Arthur Lipsett","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":"/uL09XjFi6fMHC0VhFZvIhOgVtN5.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cdec3a368484e1ca69f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Lipsett","original_name":"Arthur Lipsett","popularity":0.0929,"profile_path":"/uL09XjFi6fMHC0VhFZvIhOgVtN5.jpg","credit_id":"57823ec7c3a3686f6400016c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590742,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donald Brittain","original_name":"Donald Brittain","popularity":0.0706,"profile_path":"/jSp8rMTzF5HI6ZvdFJ6PrkHJTCv.jpg","credit_id":"57823ed4c3a3686fb500016e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1410991,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ron Alexander","original_name":"Ron Alexander","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ff821e7a4ee700aaad1099","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0204001","wikidata_id":"Q4660340","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rq7cep3T4zM0xXfxc7iPyaegDqs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.663,"height":1037,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wIY2juOeUxSixtXFWBuDpRYXZgY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":688},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/92LHAfV75U1rKkXOSr4PjdawMf4.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/bZNNZJeSOr6Y9aXUf5LTBNlH5at.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":507}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":220870,"name":"newsreel"},{"id":224230,"name":"collage film"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: Wikipedia (Venice)","release_date":"1966-08-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
