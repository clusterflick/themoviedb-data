Set in the very European boutiques, cafes and bars of Melbourne's inner lane-ways the film focuses on the highs and lows of aspiring artist Lizzie Baxter. Lizzie is a lost soul living in denial. At 28, she would prefer to stay in a shallow relationship than take charge of her own life. This is Lizzie's unique story but also the story of an entire generation; living in limbo and not ready to grow up.","popularity":0.5598,"poster_path":"/yb8aopTkhdbrXj3ig4maYKsiCW3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2010-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Centre Place","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Markovski","original_name":"Julia Markovski","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Lizzie Houghton","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a368484e1ca0b3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sullivan Stapleton","original_name":"Sullivan Stapleton","popularity":0.603,"profile_path":"/vWadhfczxktoYQBC6TaAk6bE6Ci.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"James Ballintyne","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a368484e1ca0b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1185655,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alison Whyte","original_name":"Alison Whyte","popularity":0.1559,"profile_path":"/pTuH8WTTHXNLfWOa5NHQ4uAPPDS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jo","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a368484e1ca0bb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1068123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Waters","original_name":"John Waters","popularity":0.24,"profile_path":"/o5Kgv9eVS5vyM01RJFGBIiZSEBp.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jack Houghton","credit_id":"5f968bbabd32090038f10b17","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1531173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Bowen","original_name":"Jay Bowen","popularity":0.2728,"profile_path":"/u8wKGJrXYolSfUfAFrnCj4p4uZX.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Cameron Houghton","credit_id":"5f968c006c0b3600330b30bc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1230271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Forza","original_name":"Robert Forza","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Angelo","credit_id":"5f968c189a64c10037bf5a8b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2830700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Constantinou","original_name":"Patrick Constantinou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Simon","credit_id":"5f968c4777e1f60037c3be24","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2830701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Main","original_name":"Joe Main","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Julius","credit_id":"5f968c6da1074b0037f55c90","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185653,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Shackleford","original_name":"Ben Shackleford","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a368484e1ca0af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1429445","wikidata_id":"Q127600430","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yb8aopTkhdbrXj3ig4maYKsiCW3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"(Skip City International D-Cinema Festival)","release_date":"2010-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
