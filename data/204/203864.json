Gaudino made his directorial debut with this experimental film portrait contrasting the ancient Roman empire with poverty in present-day Naples. The film's narrator introduces the ancient town of Pozzuloi, home to Nero, his mother Agrippina, the Sibyl of Cumae, and Christian martyr Artema. This historical drama is intertwined with a modern-day story of a poverty-stricken family, forced by earthquakes during the '70s to move to the country, a devastating blow to the close-knit family. After a 1997 Venice Film Festival screening at 125 minutes, the filmmakers announced their plans to re-edit to a shorter running time. Also known as Moonspins Between Land and Sea.","popularity":0.277,"poster_path":"/gjU6pFzU2m9dymNRJv0TyyUJ6Hc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13328,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gaundri Film","origin_country":""},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Latin","iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Round the Moons Between Earth and Sea","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":70488,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olimpia Carlisi","original_name":"Olimpia Carlisi","popularity":0.2039,"profile_path":"/7imfGuYkW1ntJltlDtRJtSkt6Qg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"La Sibilla Cumana","credit_id":"5995bac09251417c0d000b72","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1080795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Femiano","original_name":"Tina Femiano","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":"/bU9enMac0j4T4CaRQjwtEOXGsqR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Donna Mena Gioia","credit_id":"5995badbc3a3683dc1000a4b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1153469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salvatore Grasso","original_name":"Salvatore Grasso","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Gennarino Gioia","credit_id":"5995baf4c3a3683e330009d5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aldo Bufi Landi","original_name":"Aldo Bufi Landi","popularity":0.1839,"profile_path":"/2vp4NvWpxjlEOFho8yxFb4bDjJN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Don Salvatore Gioia","credit_id":"5995bb0dc3a3683f5d0008ad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1871540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincenza Modica","original_name":"Vincenza Modica","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":"/xznKlMpS8Nzali62ykANXTzF2lM.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Assunta Gioia","credit_id":"5995bb2b9251417d44000ab3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":552990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Pennarella","original_name":"Antonio Pennarella","popularity":0.1671,"profile_path":"/yjFHsVDFe1Bo6XoOnYKXBzY9oNh.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Tonino Gioia","credit_id":"5995bb3ec3a3683e33000a19","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luciano Zazzera","original_name":"Luciano Zazzera","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Luigi Gioia","credit_id":"5995bb599251417f2f000895","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonella Romano","original_name":"Antonella Romano","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Luisa","credit_id":"5995bb799251417eb1000977","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberta Spagnuolo","original_name":"Roberta Spagnuolo","popularity":0.1331,"profile_path":"/1othdGCr5D6tXNe2eMQHQgLMsHO.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"5995bb92c3a3683dc1000ae7","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1507415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonella Stefanucci","original_name":"Antonella Stefanucci","popularity":0.1195,"profile_path":"/9bjy9997lYRePhvJ7UfrJkisNLr.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Maria la pazza","credit_id":"5995bbb792514107ba01697f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1871218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastiano Colla","original_name":"Sebastiano Colla","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/64tO5nmmXROLbQE9w81pUhdkV2h.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Nerone","credit_id":"5995bbc79251417f2f0008f1","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1186192,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giuseppe M.
