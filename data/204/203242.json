Armed with video cameras, twelve artists present a highly stylized portrait of San Yuan Li, a traditional village besieged by China's urban sprawl. China's rapid modernization literally traps the village of San Yuan Li within the surrounding skyscrapers of Guangzhou, a city of 12 million people. The villagers move to a different rhythm, thriving on subsistence farming and traditional crafts. They resourcefully reinvent their traditional lifestyle by tending rice paddies on empty city lots and raising chickens on makeshift rooftop coops.","popularity":0.1248,"poster_path":"/plN5mh5OzaHG64Azg69G82NI6j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2003-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"San Yuan Li","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1185649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ning Ou","original_name":"Ning Ou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a368484e1ca01f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1185650,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cao Fei","original_name":"Cao Fei","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gBJOFVy8iHrY8twGQOit1VBWk7n.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a368484e1ca025","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1847683","wikidata_id":"Q7415406","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/plN5mh5OzaHG64Azg69G82NI6j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Icarus Films / dGenerate Films","release_date":"2003-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
