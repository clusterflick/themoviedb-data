The band’s phenomenal rise and its highly publicized dissolution at the height of their fame in the early ’80s captured by Summers’ camera.  Utilizing rare archival footage, Summers’ photos, and insights from the guitarist’s side of the stage, Can’t Stand Losing You brings together past and present as the band members prepare to reunite for the first time in two decades later for a global reunion tour in 2007.","popularity":1.5314,"poster_path":"/b6esoeyPX5sKsvickaqD54dGZSJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12260,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bob Yari Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":831,"logo_path":"/vLENXiYTyITnMDrTKabUXhgTKX2.png","name":"Saturn Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Can't Stand Losing You: Surviving The Police","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":15,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":982,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sting","original_name":"Sting","popularity":0.7867,"profile_path":"/y6gpCAf6LTHcqFXEZ2udXJkucAm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a368484e1c9e69","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2987,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stewart Copeland","original_name":"Stewart Copeland","popularity":0.3015,"profile_path":"/dvvrI5uWlNwVJ8Bz6r7vSrBffQa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a368484e1c9e6d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Summers","original_name":"Andy Summers","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":"/h0vEeD0eFnOKmP0AaYudK8bChAD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4cdbc3a368484e1c9e71","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Cage","original_name":"Nicolas Cage","popularity":6.88,"profile_path":"/ar33qcWbEgREn07ZpXv5Pbj8hbM.jpg","credit_id":"6231d55c0582240070a03fc3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1110343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lauren Lazin","original_name":"Lauren Lazin","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"539171f4c3a3686472000f54","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":56072,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andy Grieve","original_name":"Andy Grieve","popularity":0.0564,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53917200c3a3686472000f56","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18956,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Norman Golightly","original_name":"Norman Golightly","popularity":0.1492,"profile_path":"/vFMJmsfYZNgzNMS6EvFQg0lJyDp.jpg","credit_id":"671eb6afc7802cc5035a74bf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1610013","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rnK0wSctHQbmAd7lQsCAYF2WbTw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2829,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b6esoeyPX5sKsvickaqD54dGZSJ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1886},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d3dMywAi1aTHPz2J912BRJ9o190.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/fzxc6q8k0qgZvLflqnIoiCCchg0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":578,"name":"rock 'n' roll"},{"id":953,"name":"guitar"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"},{"id":208289,"name":"1980s"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"18A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Can't Stand Losing You: Surviving the Police Official Trailer 1 (2015) - Documentary HD","key":"QAtOXEGJZm0","published_at":"2015-03-03T19:02:16.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"54f73c2792514151c60023c9"}]}}}
