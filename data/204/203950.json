The trouble begins when crotchety postman Andre begins complaining about his young neighbor Marianna's propensity for playing loud music every time she entertains a lover. To get back at him, Marianna begins sending him anonymous love letters. The old man is intrigued by the mysterious letters and hires a cheap detective to find their author. The detective is convinced the perpetrator is Teresita, a veteran hooker who joins in on the scheme to earn a little extra cash. Andre's friend and colleague tries to warn Andre that it is all a game, but his friend is in love and will not listen. Meanwhile, Marianna attempts to woo Luis Felipe, a hard, unfeeling tabloid journalist who has her take grisly pictures of murder victims for him. Both Marianna and Andre are destined to meet an unpleasant fate at the story's end.","popularity":0.2505,"poster_path":"/na7RPhAPEeq0Z0VoBhqkgJRlIhr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sin remitente","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Felipe Tovar","original_name":"Luis Felipe Tovar","popularity":0.2791,"profile_path":"/mU3SBAT94zK3czhbyEYf3l94ib.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Luis Felipe","credit_id":"52fe4ceac3a368484e1cc95f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":974732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiaré Scanda","original_name":"Tiaré Scanda","popularity":0.3608,"profile_path":"/tEIJnn5ZVHUtDdFLhHP0Q2Fdgxx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mariana","credit_id":"52fe4ceac3a368484e1cc963","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":974733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Torre Laphame","original_name":"Fernando Torre Laphame","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Andrés","credit_id":"52fe4ceac3a368484e1cc967","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":224508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luisa Huertas","original_name":"Luisa Huertas","popularity":0.2239,"profile_path":"/6GuQjQESw4RBadSElqaunwKhOKE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Teresita de Jesús","credit_id":"625f883e168ea300a3676bdd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guillermo Gil","original_name":"Guillermo Gil","popularity":0.184,"profile_path":"/bN1AGtC6yS3SdMOgAUQAUsOTMKF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mario","credit_id":"625f884d9defda01652e4fe8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":112211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gina Morett","original_name":"Gina Morett","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/5ePGy1xKKtKjPOyHBunDjJCWIDg.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Betty","credit_id":"625f885ddb952d009e4d77d1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1508206,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nora Velázquez","original_name":"Nora Velázquez","popularity":0.209,"profile_path":"/lh3fpLrabTkEuJ6rDGaighy1N1C.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Rosa, Mario's Wife","credit_id":"625f8871bb070d009d49bd73","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Carlos Colombo","original_name":"Juan Carlos Colombo","popularity":0.2209,"profile_path":"/fZj6vegsA169QA8arkqEk01d5XE.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Editor-in-chief","credit_id":"625f8889168ea30067316a11","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Álvaro Carcaño","original_name":"Álvaro Carcaño","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Police Bureau Official","credit_id":"625f889dd4cc8e0067dfb303","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesús Ochoa","original_name":"Jesús Ochoa","popularity":0.3099,"profile_path":"/7q5cin3hrPIhMqRkPZ2sSyTrqlk.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Forensic Surgeon","credit_id":"625f88ab168ea300a3676dd0","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Carrera","original_name":"Carlos Carrera","popularity":0.174,"profile_path":"/xJCfZ69eUxx6B7GtrCBLoIgwFsX.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ceac3a368484e1cc95b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0111198","wikidata_id":"Q15207538","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tl7NFPNi6duP5feljNKLfu71MjK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/na7RPhAPEeq0Z0VoBhqkgJRlIhr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
