He has written scientific papers describing it as a ‘living laboratory’. Largely untouched by humans, it is one of the last places where the delicate balance of nature prevails. But an international fishing fleet has recently found its way to the Ross Sea. It is targeting Antarctic toothfish, sold as Chilean sea bass in up-market restaurants around the world.  The catch is so lucrative it is known as white gold. Ainley knows that unless fishing is stopped the natural balance of the Ross Sea will be lost forever. Together they form ‘the Last Ocean’ and begin a campaign taking on the commercial fishers and governments in a race to protect Earth’s last untouched ocean from our insatiable appetite for fish.","popularity":0.2653,"poster_path":"/yS4iSeNtZ9jeGaxXSca9PF7gd99.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Ross Sea, Antarctica is the most pristine stretch of ocean on Earth.
