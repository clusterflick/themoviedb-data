The classic Hollywood portrayals of pistol packin' mamas, tomboy sharp shooters, sexually twisted femme fatales, and high-heeled, cold-blooded assassins are caricatures. In truth, the typical woman who hangs out at rifle ranges and keeps ammo in her purse is the girl-next-door, the single mom, a hard working sister or aunt. Maybe she's a realist or has learned tough lessons from life; either way, she cares about her personal safety and may even find salvation, comfort or something satisfying in possessing a gun. In a word, she is empowered.  Breaking through the caricatures, A Girl and a Gun reveals America's diverse and far-ranging female gun community. It depicts how this community is portrayed by the media and targeted by the gun industry; and shows, through personal stories, how guns change women's lives.","popularity":0.0662,"poster_path":"/k1KSeEtlb4QGLegAydxwlsBHJqa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Girl and a Gun","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1450301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Violet Blue","original_name":"Violet Blue","popularity":0.1232,"profile_path":"/4hdHirtosOlhSm2b09TXr3aY3sc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"60d926310b5fd6005f52e440","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1186265,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cathryne Czubek","original_name":"Cathryne Czubek","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/lsHxlKHrIJt3eA1PLxckEm6XJlo.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ceac3a368484e1cc8e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1735279","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k1KSeEtlb4QGLegAydxwlsBHJqa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
