Within days, he finds her in bed with a muscular sportsman. Heartbroken and vulnerable, Kieran finds himself as the unlikely student of a pick-up guru. Using an array of unorthodox techniques, Kieran immerses himself in a new area of study with geeky enthusiasm. To the surprise of his teacher and his contemporaries, Kieran becomes a phenomenon on the campus dating scene. As his success levels soar out of control, Kieran's studies and morals begin to suffer.
