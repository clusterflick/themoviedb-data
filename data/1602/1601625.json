Offenbach's Secret follows the staging of Croquefer and Les deux Aveugles at the Theatre des Bouffes-Parisiens founded by Offenbach in 1855. Limited by French law to one act  with no more than three singers, Offenbach's early operettas were filled with biting social commentary and poked fun at the moral ambiguity of France's Second Empire under Napoleon III. In addition to Offenbach's vivacious music, the film features lush costumes, period details, and striking set designs.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zk1rxbTtIoPDkvqa6zO9sSA9o8g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Offenbach's Secret","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1143417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laurence Dale","original_name":"Laurence Dale","popularity":0.1013,"profile_path":"/Afa1V2vxftX8gkozyF7DcGikE3n.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Patachon","credit_id":"69472c51fccba4aab8b1c7f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5889797,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Clark","original_name":"Graham Clark","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Girafier","credit_id":"69472c75c0569d5cb3fb0d9a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125402,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tamás Jordán","original_name":"Tamás Jordán","popularity":0.5308,"profile_path":"/3P5N5vIOWeuLlyhlSfcqBOj04I8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jacques Offenbach","credit_id":"69472c99b6f83d7552fb0ce2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25450,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pál Makrai","original_name":"Pál Makrai","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":"/iQobUbonwVAx8aqL2yhmmmfRuej.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Croquefer","credit_id":"69472cb8c2cfd514a37abc54","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":225898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"István Szabó","original_name":"István Szabó","popularity":0.8829,"profile_path":"/xoKtSZvgW3rp6YfFzxQk8bhc7nI.jpg","credit_id":"69472727fda98db1afb1c61e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ottokar Runze","original_name":"Ottokar Runze","popularity":0.1484,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69472752128330a241b1c456","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0125443","wikidata_id":"Q27926065","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vr3C5SjPElQW6gNAdaNNI8AkjN8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zk1rxbTtIoPDkvqa6zO9sSA9o8g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"0","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1996-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
