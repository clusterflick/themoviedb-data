As she juggles a collapsing system, an understaffed ward, and a stream of emergencies—from dying patients to Fred, a combative amputee, and a medical error that nearly costs a life—her professional composure begins to fracture. Haunted by the memory of a young girl she couldn’t save and the growing distance from her teenage daughter, Riya’s night spirals into a raw reckoning with compassion, burnout, and the quiet heroism that holds the health service together.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10393,"logo_path":"/7MazD0kppT5OzdumzDi5IFYNthO.png","name":"Vertigo Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Quiet Hour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Play for Today: The Quiet Hour","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5889334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margo Roe","original_name":"Margo Roe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6946e4eddebf5529e78eb3ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5261383,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sarah Louise Madden","original_name":"Sarah Louise Madden","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6946e508a79d0063cd7ab998","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
