The film is a pastiche of commercials that are related to the French capital in one way or another. An advertising clip directed by Jean-Luc Godard is followed by a silent movie from the 20s for the legendary French cigarette brand GITANES. Through subtle montage and sequencing, McLaren creates a collage of movements and sounds. The result is a terrific symphony that catapults Walter Benjamin’s Capital of the 19th century“ into the future.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4ioO5nFqAxBN9gzDWfxI1TsZDsp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paris, Capital of the XXIst Century","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1442631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malcolm McLaren","original_name":"Malcolm McLaren","popularity":0.1422,"profile_path":"/xE2qbGWapFXjJgTrNJGs9j8smuJ.jpg","credit_id":"69484bbb79548cde948121b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4ioO5nFqAxBN9gzDWfxI1TsZDsp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
