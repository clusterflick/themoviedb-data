Here movement (bodily, textual & spatial) becomes a way of thinking through questions of positionality regarding the self and environment. It was sparked by my participation in the Seminario Itinerante in the summer of 2016, an experimental group seminar organized by Beatriz Santiago Muñoz, Anahita Hekmat, and Mapenzi Chibale Nonó through Beta-Local (San Juan, PR), and the experience of walking down the western coast of Puerto Rico & living outside immersed in its elements for a stretch of time. I seek to acknowledge the contradictions present in this contested landscape; the co-existence of beauty and disenfranchisement, of abundance and glaring lack. Tapping into the rhythm of dreaming and growth despite difficulty, this piece extends the resonance of these concepts to other internal and external landscapes.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vxH06av0yAGqh1ldJKQou81WPnJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"sweat/tears/sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Miatta Kawinzi","original_name":"Miatta Kawinzi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694845477d9897366c8eb888","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vxH06av0yAGqh1ldJKQou81WPnJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
