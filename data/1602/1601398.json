An architectural projector illuminates the brick-built film screen in the middle of the space. But there is no film and no audience. The numerous and varied perspectives, surfaces and materials in the space are the focus of the camera.\r The film begins outside the perforated brick wall, which separates the cinema from public space. The wall affords glimpses into the space, divides it from the city and renders the projection space ambiguous. The space becomes visible, yet remains inaccessible. Typical for its area and its time, it reminds one also of a different climatic zone, a different modern age in a faraway place.\r Once inside the camera step by step goes more into the details of the space and the elaborate surfaces, revealing the performative and graphic character of the architecture.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mwYtobdja0WdeJnKcsF0s4o3rlj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schnitt A-A'","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5889029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sofie Thorsen","original_name":"Sofie Thorsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6946b34cc0569d5cb3fb0bca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2550,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mwYtobdja0WdeJnKcsF0s4o3rlj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
