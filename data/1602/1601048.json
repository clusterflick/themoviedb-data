During the U.S. traveling exhibit of the King Tut relics, a couple of movers bang the sarcophagus into a wall and permit air to reach the mummified remains of the Boy King. Tut comes to life and wanders the streets, confused by the environs. Seeing the Golden Arches, it’s implied that he recognizes them as having a pyramid shape and bows down to pray. Ronald McDonald, who is inside, sexually harrassing the female workers, sees Tut and goes out to chase him away, assaulting Tut in the process. Tut makes his way to a nearby nuclear reactor, climbs the cooling tower, and falls inside causing the first nuclear meltdown in U.S. film.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"No Video Found","title":"King Tut Goes to McDonald's","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5887618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Dean Coburn","original_name":"Joseph Dean Coburn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6945b9914e760029912fb5f5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534527,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Paul Boyington","original_name":"Paul Boyington","popularity":0.1239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6945b9a5128330a241b1bf57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534527,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Paul Boyington","original_name":"Paul Boyington","popularity":0.1239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6945bb3502ba77b2d78cda9f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534527,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Paul Boyington","original_name":"Paul Boyington","popularity":0.1239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6945bb44e5069b831d7ab58d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5887625,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul R.
