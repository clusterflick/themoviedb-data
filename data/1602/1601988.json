A panoptic gaze is implied; one is never lonely, yet always lonely. An obscure reality is portrayed, shrouded with paranoia and superfluous information. Flashing cuts of vignettes appear, jumping between the virtual and tangible realm. The character, trapped in this reality, burrows into a state of complete apathy, growingly disoriented by the hyper saturation of superfluous information and paranoid atmosphere. Blank space, blank eyes, blank name. The viewers are invited to disorient themselves in this obscure world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hMvhCjrL69AowcQIeR4NLeOQDyX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paranoia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emre Özakat","original_name":"Emre Özakat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"69486879cc88e5d2d9812403","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5891234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emre Özakat","original_name":"Emre Özakat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6948686e768ed4dfdd8123da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hMvhCjrL69AowcQIeR4NLeOQDyX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10583,"name":"performance art"},{"id":258226,"name":"visual poetry"},{"id":305843,"name":"art film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Gerrit Rietveld Graduation Show 2020 - August 26-30 ","release_date":"2020-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
