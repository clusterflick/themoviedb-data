At first glance, her life seems perfect—but she hides a secret: a compulsion for risky sex.  When her husband suggests the family move to a smaller city, Julia sees the move as a chance to leave behind her self-destructive behavior and become the wife and mother she always wanted to be. However, as the moving date approaches, her compulsion intensifies, threatening to expose her secrets and jeopardize her family and emotional stability.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2429,"logo_path":"/s0p6DEF7H9yooJFjKhN4lFpTiVk.png","name":"Conspiração Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":205328,"logo_path":"/jnjQmSwaNZEeiteT857QVIXLgIt.png","name":"Globoplay","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":167704,"logo_path":"/eVTzWqrkdybUTGGBFl3gTq0NlRm.png","name":"Star Original Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"In the Ogre's Garden","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Dans le Jardin de l’Ogre","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Braga","original_name":"Alice Braga","popularity":3.4929,"profile_path":"/ykVmsm3For9dCBfWLRtTL0EU24b.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Júlia","credit_id":"6945e9097422142406b1bfa9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5537131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodrigo Pintto","original_name":"Rodrigo Pintto","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6945e99ab3365ea1108cdb26","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milhem Cortaz","original_name":"Milhem Cortaz","popularity":1.0104,"profile_path":"/vA9hgFemy6JHxgjdbQW78xZyAnq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6945eb22a8960a19090728d3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":221940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolina Jabor","original_name":"Carolina Jabor","popularity":0.3331,"profile_path":"/bXx79lkuI6k7c8sgKjHaO2Dvn0M.jpg","credit_id":"6945e8ec7894fbe8ef811a84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3691577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rita Piffer","original_name":"Rita Piffer","popularity":0.1876,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6945e9d1c2b88060a27ab5e1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":221940,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolina Jabor","original_name":"Carolina Jabor","popularity":0.3331,"profile_path":"/bXx79lkuI6k7c8sgKjHaO2Dvn0M.jpg","credit_id":"6945e9f09aecf23af6811a2c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2382009,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Victoria Visco","original_name":"Victoria Visco","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6945ea04eb0466f518fb08c8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
