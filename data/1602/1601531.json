She then discovers that the company’s liaison sent to remove her is her estranged grandson, Peter. What follows is a clash between generations, class, and values: Barbara’s fierce attachment to home and identity versus Peter’s desperate need to hold onto his corporate job. As their battle becomes public, turning into a small-town spectacle of protest, press, and community chaos, both are forced to confront what “home” really means, and how love, pride, and belonging can both bind and divide a family. Witty, warm, and deeply human, \"Village Idiot\" captures rural England on the brink of change with equal parts humour and heartbreak.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10393,"logo_path":"/7MazD0kppT5OzdumzDi5IFYNthO.png","name":"Vertigo Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Village Idiot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Play for Today: Village Idiot","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5889336,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Samson Hawkins","original_name":"Samson Hawkins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6946e58d665145056d154e1c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2780801,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rhys Aaron Lewis","original_name":"Rhys Aaron Lewis","popularity":0.0364,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6946e5a505478850e22fb8bb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
