Gliding 400ft beneath the surface in the Pacific Ocean sometime in late 1942. A Japanese convoy has been spotted and the U.S.S. Herring is on the prowl.

another.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ddKooTITpkwkLBlARVyuULdbug2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11429,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hit & Run
