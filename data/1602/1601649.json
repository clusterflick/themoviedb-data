It's packed with music and fun biblical teaching! In this two-disk set, Ken and Buddy demonstrate to children that God created animals, including dinosaurs, on the sixth day. Did dinosaurs roam the earth with Adam? Did T. rex dine on fruits and vegetables? How did dinosaurs fit on the Ark? Ken and Buddy (and Casey the dog!) answer these questions and more. Special bonus features include quick links to four of Buddy's most popular songs, as well as the full audio track from Ken's important talk for parents, \"Raising Godly Children in an Ungodly World.\" A free discussion guide is also included. The package includes 2 DVDs and a discussion guide, divided into 2 parts, each approximately 30 minutes long.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/euebficVpJ43LTYPPGFmtbhVEDG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dinosaurs, Genesis, and the Gospel","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Ham","original_name":"Ken Ham","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"69473660ea4043936f2fb95c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2166739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buddy Davis","original_name":"Buddy Davis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6947366f4ac07071242fbbea","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1455494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Ham","original_name":"Ken Ham","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6947371ef948d17d1f811f1f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2166739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buddy Davis","original_name":"Buddy Davis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6947372d958d552c457abbe1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2139404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Varnum","original_name":"Paul Varnum","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69473764e41379f239072dc7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2139404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Varnum","original_name":"Paul Varnum","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6947378c74ec27ff2d073722","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2139404,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Varnum","original_name":"Paul Varnum","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694737ae86c6d003b67abcb3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2139418,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nicholas Matthews","original_name":"Nicholas Matthews","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"694737dd739bae2a6d154d92","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2166739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buddy Davis","original_name":"Buddy Davis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69473be205478850e22fb9df","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":960,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zchO9yJp9gra2j9Xe9fgM7GptNJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1706}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/euebficVpJ43LTYPPGFmtbhVEDG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2004-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Here’s What MANY Christians Get Wrong About Dinosaurs","key":"RrDONS5I26M","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2025-09-19T19:00:26.000Z","id":"69473c7305478850e22fb9ec"}]}}}
