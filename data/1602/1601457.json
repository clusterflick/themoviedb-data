The film shows a haphazardly shot, fragmented property viewing and inventarisation through the eyes of a child, featuring a voice over by that same child.  Because of having unrestricted access to their family’s camcorder as a child, there were a few instances where the artist's child form had shot ‘full length’ documentary films - with this documentary short being one of those instances.  Often these documentations were a call for seeking comfort in a new surrounding, stemming from a deep fear of being forgotten or unheard, and a playful way of documenting one’s thoughts and feelings. In many ways the artist, Mees Joachim, was the original vlogger, before the advent of Youtube.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vaP4xZU0L68Cj13EspPKeclQR4I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Sense Of Comfort","title":"Documenting Selfie Intern #1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5889123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jojanneke van Amesfoort","original_name":"Jojanneke van Amesfoort","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Nakkeke","credit_id":"6946c39824937a5336154e12","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5886162,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Fabiënne van Amesfoort-Salm","original_name":"Fabiënne van Amesfoort-Salm","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mama","credit_id":"6946c3a8f948d17d1f811d97","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5889124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dennis van Amesfoort","original_name":"Dennis van Amesfoort","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Papa","credit_id":"6946c3b8b7631a79bd072b2f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5885845,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","original_name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/zvaMuuivuyiEaSxXZ9sCSUKTLCW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6946c3d825905827412fb80d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5885845,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","original_name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/zvaMuuivuyiEaSxXZ9sCSUKTLCW.jpg","credit_id":"6946c3fd1b3349feaf8cde21","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5885845,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","original_name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/zvaMuuivuyiEaSxXZ9sCSUKTLCW.jpg","credit_id":"6946c40aaf47521cee072cfc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5885845,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","original_name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/zvaMuuivuyiEaSxXZ9sCSUKTLCW.jpg","credit_id":"6946c4203ac113fa83072b9d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5885845,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","original_name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/zvaMuuivuyiEaSxXZ9sCSUKTLCW.jpg","credit_id":"6946c42f797990b0368cdc39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5885845,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","original_name":"Mees Joachim van Amesfoort","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/zvaMuuivuyiEaSxXZ9sCSUKTLCW.jpg","credit_id":"6946c4586d365600fafb0cb7","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":1002,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/an2ppOKWKjVYgjtqJq38K0Zkosu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1780}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vaP4xZU0L68Cj13EspPKeclQR4I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5609,"name":"nostalgia"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":305843,"name":"art film"},{"id":354357,"name":"archival footage"},{"id":358880,"name":"90s"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"Daily screenings during GRA Graduation Show in Amsterdam - July 3-7, 2019 ","release_date":"2019-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"Documenting Selfie Intern #1\" by Joachim Stiller / Mees Joachim, 2018/2019","key":"ogfR3UiWsvo","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-05-12T12:03:31.000Z","id":"6946c35feb0466f518fb0c9a"}]}}}
