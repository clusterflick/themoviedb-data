Lou, Dev, and Alistair, three old friends clinging to their annual wild camping tradition, begin with banter, nostalgia, and amateur vlogging, but soon unravel into a battle of egos, secrets, and survival when they get lost, food runs short, and friendships fracture. At once funny, poignant, and unsettling, \"Wild\" explores the line between adventure and recklessness, and how toxic masculinity has become a huge part of the epidemic decline in men’s mental health.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10393,"logo_path":"/7MazD0kppT5OzdumzDi5IFYNthO.png","name":"Vertigo Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Wild","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Play for Today: Wild","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5889329,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lewis Wren","original_name":"Lewis Wren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6946e3eccc88e5d2d9811dbb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4377347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brick","original_name":"Brick","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6946e425f159144b35fb0c90","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
