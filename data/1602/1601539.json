With the 1979 revival at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, August Everding revives a forgotten piece of German-Jewish cultural history. When the Deutsche Oper Berlin staged this great work in 1979, the opera house initially came in for fierce criticism. However, this was not due to the performance itself, but to the fact that the Deutsche Oper Berlin was including operettas in its program for the first time.  After 40 years, we have now succeeded in publishing this wonderful performance. This is also thanks to the approval of Dame Gwyneth Jones.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":"/ro41Ujvucm05MdcnzUB9ycoFg5s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Merry Widow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5889368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Kollo","original_name":"René Kollo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Graf Danilo Danilowitsch","credit_id":"6946e9c6d44920a6037abbec","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":553682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Siegfried Jerusalem","original_name":"Siegfried Jerusalem","popularity":0.1367,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Camille de Rosillon","credit_id":"6946e9f42ee03d54d9154cde","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1109283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gwyneth Jones","original_name":"Gwyneth Jones","popularity":0.2593,"profile_path":"/ehIPPH2vINJAPNHgoHe2vHvUg5t.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hanna Glawari","credit_id":"6946ea3486c6d003b67abb6c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1219183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Peacock","original_name":"Lucy Peacock","popularity":0.128,"profile_path":"/fSPnM4Qz15GnqtsRosWwU8qbbCn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Valencienne","credit_id":"6946ea983739bb00c62fba52","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":590785,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Franz Lehár","original_name":"Franz Lehár","popularity":0.2122,"profile_path":"/qHkrXpIf0xMS2EsaY1TpfxifDP.jpg","credit_id":"6946eac053a825795c154c91","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1628,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ro41Ujvucm05MdcnzUB9ycoFg5s.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1155}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1979-03-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
