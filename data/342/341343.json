She takes him in, even though everyone dissuades her from doing so. She is forced to accept that her proximity to Jimmie does not have the desired effect for his progress. On the contrary, his reactions to the unfamiliar situation are fierce, taking her to her limits time and again. The only thing that makes Jimmie feel comfortable is swimming: his greatest passion. When the swim coach discovers his talent, new prospects seem to open for him.","popularity":0.1041,"poster_path":"/qSrAX5mP9uka4gUR0FxxIpcvBl0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jimmie","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":223477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joel Basman","original_name":"Joel Basman","popularity":0.5254,"profile_path":"/uaBcyvAe8t5x5OuRiX50rPkTda6.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Jimmie Berger","credit_id":"58a788f2c3a36860890005a3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64017,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Rapold","original_name":"Martin Rapold","popularity":0.1222,"profile_path":"/o85UjN2AbOfizpisZ512vhNGxlO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jan","credit_id":"5afc63e492514107470082a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49443,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Neuenschwander","original_name":"Michael Neuenschwander","popularity":0.195,"profile_path":"/cM1OGMM6minruZPhJ4IvFpr1Gnu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Michael Berger","credit_id":"5afc6416925141071b006a79","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1183605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Japp","original_name":"Stephanie Japp","popularity":0.2261,"profile_path":"/1FaPV2f4oPa0QI7raWvlujq8Ua9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kathy Berger","credit_id":"5afc6426925141079e0067ec","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":146057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miriam Stein","original_name":"Miriam Stein","popularity":0.4827,"profile_path":"/rrJ38GVvRnhldzxGnIUAv919INu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dana","credit_id":"5afc64350e0a2634430080f7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1067612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Utzinger","original_name":"Sandra Utzinger","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/3yqnrHqXezSTzRcKKwKKeXYEKab.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Franziska","credit_id":"5afc644592514107a9006365","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tobias Ineichen","original_name":"Tobias Ineichen","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e6c7e95cabfe4001112f4e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1139795","wikidata_id":"Q1532416","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qSrAX5mP9uka4gUR0FxxIpcvBl0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":509}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
