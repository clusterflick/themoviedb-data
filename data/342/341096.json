It is two different kinds of sale jobs working at cross-purposes. Oppenheimer takes the luster off the idealistic advertising images through video distortion and electronic interference and cuts-up both the video and audio tracks until the weird poetry of the chain gang prisoner's lessons in life and death gives the commercial presentation a creepy disconnection from any kind of living ideal. It follows A BRIEF HISTORY OF PARADISE AS TOLD BY THE COCKROACHES and MARKET UPDATE as another sharp jab at consumerism as an illusory promise.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":"/ki6pzuHRE1qFgYWoNJQFoOLbcmD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Postcard from Sun City, Arizona","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53296,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joshua Oppenheimer","original_name":"Joshua Oppenheimer","popularity":0.1531,"profile_path":"/dHlrnmh2X0xZYmEfEwcsLTuarAD.jpg","credit_id":"555e1c5b9251417e4f00039d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5952300","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ki6pzuHRE1qFgYWoNJQFoOLbcmD.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":752,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2KEjvfRyw4iIuuNmLrdB6hX1Tv6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":505},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/d2D8Fy1G7ZuqgghzbTqa4EAy4tS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
