Created while in the midst of production on the feature-length GLOBALIZATION TAPES, this brief film is Oppenheimer's most concentrated piece of socio-political commentary: a quick, colorful political cartoon of capitalism plucked out-of-context and set to a soundtrack that is both comic and somewhat sinister. The upbeat musical accompaniment only enhances the empty celebration of meaningless activity.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/LZ4kXA7RslhdfwZQ1Sxd9zXxPU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Market Update","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53296,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joshua Oppenheimer","original_name":"Joshua Oppenheimer","popularity":0.1531,"profile_path":"/dHlrnmh2X0xZYmEfEwcsLTuarAD.jpg","credit_id":"555e1cc6c3a36868f2000353","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5952286","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/LZ4kXA7RslhdfwZQ1Sxd9zXxPU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":953,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ySUbARTmmfyZDgl0VelbEC8kqil.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-08-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
