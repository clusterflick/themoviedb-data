In myriad ways, 1964 was the year when Americans faced choices: between the liberalism of Lyndon Johnson or Barry Goldwater’s grassroots conservatism, between support for the civil rights movement or opposition to it, between an embrace of the emerging counterculture or a defense of traditional values.","popularity":0.9788,"poster_path":"/lMAUOAzkZHucAega3W2QwEUcdZ9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4857,"logo_path":"/k75xouPjU7y9IyDjVezK0kWO1y6.png","name":"Insignia Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10197,"logo_path":"/lRah8iyzBZJ90ZgsKUIWUU9XnRu.png","name":"GBH","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The pivotal year that essentially ushered in the true 1960s is explored.","title":"1964","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"American Experience: 1964","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Last Innocent Year: America in 1964 by Jon Margolis","type":"Book"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Platt","original_name":"Oliver Platt","popularity":1.7194,"profile_path":"/ipBzOzgWRdxxYoM5xNN1cfenFaC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5564b141c3a36806c800232f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Ives","original_name":"Stephen Ives","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/xn6yGCjlqIlHRWFo6rs7Lh2dBUw.jpg","credit_id":"5560a2b2c3a36868d900578d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stephen Ives","original_name":"Stephen Ives","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/xn6yGCjlqIlHRWFo6rs7Lh2dBUw.jpg","credit_id":"5560a2ccc3a36868eb00662b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1470795,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amanda Pollak","original_name":"Amanda Pollak","popularity":0.0545,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5564b0cf92514142220020d6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1116020,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nina Krstic","original_name":"Nina Krstic","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/dwjF47jJoAyCdz8UkwYtvj4ok8H.jpg","credit_id":"5564b5dbc3a368071f002318","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1209162,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Rundquist","original_name":"Peter Rundquist","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5564b61e9251416f250008d9","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1470831,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Young","original_name":"Andrew Young","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5564b6e892514144e8001267","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3154432","wikidata_id":"Q25136741","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1575,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zhej9ZVQT4MOpZnscGyS9cMdivW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2800}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.525,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lMAUOAzkZHucAega3W2QwEUcdZ9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":840,"name":"usa president"},{"id":6085,"name":"election campaign"},{"id":4098,"name":"civil rights"},{"id":170548,"name":"john f. kennedy assassination"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"PBS \"American Experience\"","release_date":"2014-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"American Experience: 1964 - HoustonPBS","key":"YdsaWriPGbU","published_at":"2014-01-13T02:38:31.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5564b56e9251414222002162"}]}}}
