In the first tale, a blonde woman with an unclear past arrives in a remote, male-deprived Andean town and offers piano lessons, only to become the focus of wild rumors and innuendo. In the second, a married college professor who is haunted by nightmares becomes obsessed with a beguiling woman who seems to be sending him an ominous message. In the final story, a couple vacationing at a jungle resort refuse to believe in the ancient myths of Ecuador, but are forced to confront the legendary Guasangó.","popularity":0.5253,"poster_path":"/2TalNVfndJ48UO6lmssVoLmGGOK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grupo
