This lavish film recreates (through his own words) the writer's childhood life, rich with fantasy and legend. Apprenticed to a tailor, young Georgios' mind is filled with his grandfather fairy tales. He ponders the hill from which one can climb into the sky and waits each day for the chance to bring clothes to the princess and win her heart through song. But, just as reality begins to germinate doubt in his mind, Georgios is called home to his ailing grandfather, who will reveal one final, true story that may prove to be the most fantastic of all.","popularity":0.2601,"poster_path":"/9QnU7UDzH5Gx83fMafFYMhRVWNJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97717,"logo_path":null,"name":"Apostolos Papaefstathiou","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Only Journey of His Life","video":false,"vote_average":5.75,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","title":"To monon tis zois tou taxeidion","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The only journey of his life","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","title":"Hayatının Tek Yolculuğu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":257562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilias Logothetis","original_name":"Ηλίας Λογοθέτης","popularity":0.1473,"profile_path":"/nYpy6wH4zz7UP7bBGhAFY1vRF9Q.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Georgios Vizyinos","credit_id":"55610215c3a36868e5006d42","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fragiski Moustaki","original_name":"Φραγκίσκη Μουστάκη","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/oY0jAJgn0stXFdmAWhTe4wW0TKl.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Giorgis -
