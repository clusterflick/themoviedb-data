Matter and the immaterial in constant counteraction. The screen becomes a painting in animation. Ordinarily, light describes the motif. Here, the forest is almost – almost – occluded as the light that delineates the world becomes autonomous, visible; describes itself as subject. There are some very strange effects: light and shadow grow, die back; bark shimmers; branches tremble, or clouds pass above; trees shiver in the cold, or shake in threatening gesture; sunlight flickers, on and off, like an electric bulb. The portrait lives.  These films are not the index of space and objects, but a cinema of time, movement, light; flickering lashes of mesmerised eyes in the click of an aperture.","popularity":0.0503,"poster_path":"/5OxLN8F5Cpl4vmWbG54uiRyXYie.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21627,"logo_path":"/wAM874kqPQoCbirbCEY3zQlz160.png","name":"Film London","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":249777,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stour Valley Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council of England","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aspect","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Richardson","original_name":"Emily Richardson","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/kmFmfhnB8XfBmz3ib6rxcMn2RLb.jpg","credit_id":"556155f19251417e510079c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Richardson","original_name":"Emily Richardson","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/kmFmfhnB8XfBmz3ib6rxcMn2RLb.jpg","credit_id":"5dee97e9dc86470013c59d64","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2478946,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benedict Drew","original_name":"Benedict Drew","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea56efd6d1bb20024a483ac","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9134476","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5OxLN8F5Cpl4vmWbG54uiRyXYie.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6VTHMtkPne2X3cFAKPYc4X3SvMQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
