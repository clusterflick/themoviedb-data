When the bodies of her mother and brother were found in the burned home of family friend James DiMaggio later that day, an AMBER Alert was issued, and a frantic multi-state manhunt for Hannah began. For a week she was kept prisoner by the increasingly unstable DiMaggio as they made their way across the state. One week later, the two were found in Idaho and DiMaggio was killed in a shootout with FBI agents, leaving Hannah as the sole survivor. As the dust settled, questions began to emerge about the nature of the relationship between Hannah and her kidnapper...and what really happened?","popularity":1.6323,"poster_path":"/mwYBJ0MkwRmdJZIgey4wIDc82MI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hybrid Productions Inc.","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kidnapped: The Hannah Anderson Story","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":28,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Patterson","original_name":"Scott Patterson","popularity":1.117,"profile_path":"/qTm0LFuV8DktunzKa5T3UZoq1tC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"James DiMaggio","credit_id":"557fa63dc3a36871ab000e6d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian McNamara","original_name":"Brian McNamara","popularity":0.603,"profile_path":"/pPuMmkeEQj7JPvxclKYXLacwHW7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Brett Anderson","credit_id":"557fa644925141256b0007ef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1219098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susie Castillo","original_name":"Susie Castillo","popularity":0.1213,"profile_path":"/bF6G8lnUkVOGR6z2mSmFr6TZazE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Colleen Ryan","credit_id":"557fa65a9251412f1d000cbf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jessica Amlee","original_name":"Jessica Amlee","popularity":0.5335,"profile_path":"/vQrhaxy306487UN7RFDVkSZAhi2.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Hannah Anderson","credit_id":"590ee217c3a368651901a8a0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jay Pickett","original_name":"Jay Pickett","popularity":0.2675,"profile_path":"/z1t0WFDKlPiGucuXrkFP700H7zx.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Agent McKinnon","credit_id":"5ef51dc34dc34a0033c6d6a3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":167290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mandy June Turpin","original_name":"Mandy June Turpin","popularity":0.3282,"profile_path":"/tFQfj8EBUJGVDR57EZPud1UGRBd.jpg","cast_id":30,"character":"Mary Young","credit_id":"67a608a0937d2e9b6066d217","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1215766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aaron Norvell","original_name":"Aaron Norvell","popularity":0.2462,"profile_path":"/e2ZSi8tyL0a5Y7u66Ty3EX1yJ7f.jpg","cast_id":31,"character":"Reporter 2","credit_id":"67e2ae39e28af41cfc75fa47","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":995466,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Barry Barnholtz","original_name":"Barry Barnholtz","popularity":0.2022,"profile_path":"/bNSSWHDAe0X8DzyioMLHL3TzvFq.jpg","credit_id":"61a07bdf470ead006276d5ee","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":995467,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zelma Kiwi","original_name":"Zelma Kiwi","popularity":0.0812,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a07bf08e8702008ef66441","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128979,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeffrey Schenck","original_name":"Jeffrey Schenck","popularity":0.1995,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61a07bf5be4b360029a8195e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92591,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Sullivan","original_name":"Peter Sullivan","popularity":0.3118,"profile_path":"/hXFy4ygelHJovKvMx37EJeHwvbm.jpg","credit_id":"61a07bffd1332400905f567f","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":564601,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kimberly A.
