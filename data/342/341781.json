The film looks at the architecture of the oil industry along the Scottish coastline where oil and gas supplies are predicted to run dry in the next forty years.  Shooting on 16mm film, using time lapse and long exposure techniques, the film presents a record of industrial phenomena, – the toxic beauty of the refinery at Grangemouth, huge drilling platforms gliding across the water as they come in for maintenance and repair at Nigg and the last dance of the shipbuilding cranes in Glasgow harbour.—http://emilyrichardson.org.uk/","popularity":0.0432,"poster_path":"/lIuzN9d5zDaN4WGkFn32gbU2LQM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249778,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lighthouse Museum, Glasgow","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Petrolia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Richardson","original_name":"Emily Richardson","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/kmFmfhnB8XfBmz3ib6rxcMn2RLb.jpg","credit_id":"55634cee925141271b00184b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1327974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Richardson","original_name":"Emily Richardson","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/kmFmfhnB8XfBmz3ib6rxcMn2RLb.jpg","credit_id":"5ea56ea66d1bb20024a4837a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2478946,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benedict Drew","original_name":"Benedict Drew","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ea56e915a46900025119f1d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9853502","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lIuzN9d5zDaN4WGkFn32gbU2LQM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":3,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":1548,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xOM8ZXMmJYAa5Z8bB1gJp74SOo3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
