Made in homage to Miyazawa Kenji's classic novel, Milky Way Railroad, the story evolves around the spiritual journey of a young woman, in the company of her best friend and a little boy, into a world of rich in-between realities. Their venture into and out of the land of \"awakened dreams\" occurs during a long ride on a night train. The filmmaker elegantly depicts each encounter in two-dimensional space with a unique artistic gesture and ingeniously frames the passage as a series of rhythmic image sequensces as seen through the window of a train.","popularity":0.083,"poster_path":"/bPozEknprS2MDbrNLMoWdHndQjS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41615,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moongift Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Passage","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"밤의 여로","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3220574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuan Li-Chi","original_name":"Yuan Li-Chi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Kyra","credit_id":"6131502ca6a4c10064fea674","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3220575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denice Lee","original_name":"Denice Lee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Nabi","credit_id":"6131503ae3fa2f008f290e66","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3220578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joshua Miller","original_name":"Joshua Miller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Shin","credit_id":"613150a55ab81a002dc4ab34","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3220579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vernon Bush","original_name":"Vernon Bush","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Man of the Night, Storyteller on Train","credit_id":"613150d03396b9008fff2ce0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3220580,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Howard Dillon","original_name":"Howard Dillon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Man of the Night, Storyteller on Train","credit_id":"613150d95ab81a0068bd2fad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":200057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Saguar","original_name":"Luis Saguar","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":"/bJebuD4W0WtE9VkosWYWSU2q7Ds.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Man of Wisdom","credit_id":"613150eebc8657002bca9cb9","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328033,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jean-Paul Bourdier","original_name":"Jean-Paul Bourdier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6131516d924ce5002af3e747","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1328033,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jean-Paul Bourdier","original_name":"Jean-Paul Bourdier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61315197b3f6f500628765ff","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1104893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trịnh T.
