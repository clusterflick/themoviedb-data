Chronicling their journey from auditions to end-of-year concert, the trials of trying to run a children's choir in a remote and disadvantaged region are revealed. Here, sport is king and music education is non-existent. Despite this, choir mistress Michelle has high expectations. She wants to teach the children contemporary, original, demanding music. It becomes clear for the children to believe in themselves, they all need someone who believes in them. Set against a landscape of devastating beauty, Wide Open Sky is a moving portrait of the fragile world of possibility that is childhood and reminds us why no child, anywhere, should grow up without music.","popularity":0.1046,"poster_path":"/AsvLMmJns3ZcJdGOsPKsLmM9vF7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wide Open Sky","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1470930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lisa Nicol","original_name":"Lisa Nicol","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5564e58ec3a368740e004832","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4085484","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cQ3yo22K4T0pHo8qa3A5FwVcUS1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/30As8Ga6FGIwfFrCrrzt6bm08tJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":3.13,"height":407,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nXOR34qKdaLnlY7BmFS7quJJPDC.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1274}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AsvLMmJns3ZcJdGOsPKsLmM9vF7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
