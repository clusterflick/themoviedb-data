Working in an array of cultural formats—from billboards and television broadcasts to community celebrations and museum exhibitions—he reformulates their codes and deploys them as catalysts for creating new experiential possibilities. A mode of perception that lies in the interstices between reality and its representation is the subject of his two-channel video, The Third Memory (2000), which reenacts the 1972 hold-up of a Brooklyn bank immortalized in Sidney Lumet's acclaimed film Dog Day Afternoon (1975). Almost 30 years later, Huyghe provides a platform for the heist's charismatic mastermind, John Wojtowicz, to relate his version of that infamous day in a reconstructed set of the bank.","popularity":0.0578,"poster_path":"/xeny2seliiUvZhLZmFl10mnWQvy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Third Memory","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Wojtowicz","original_name":"John Wojtowicz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/cABCDce9Uq6e5n4MpnsbunQXmjs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5c5d0f0b9251413374bb7fdb","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1136021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Huyghe","original_name":"Pierre Huyghe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55632a7b925141130e003330","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0396251","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.692,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xeny2seliiUvZhLZmFl10mnWQvy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":519}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
