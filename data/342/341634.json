The inner city landscape of Prague, its beautifully integrated accretion of structures, 1000 years history repressed but un-bombed, is viewed through the rhomboidal electricity-catchers on the tops of its moving trams. Trams define the rhythm of the city, &amp; so their looped noises define the rhythm of this film. As contrapuntal fixed point, the Zizkov Tower--built by the Soviets for signal-jamming broadcasts from the West &amp; looking like an about-to-launch ICBM--is accompanied by actual Cold War shortwave spy broadcasts.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Electricity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113695,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Henry Hills","original_name":"Henry Hills","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/iZiYZwSxVB7Ic3xBdl2mOCG1F2W.jpg","credit_id":"5561d38e9251417e51008d6c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
