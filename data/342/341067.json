The film captures, in haunting slow-motion, the faces of stunned and saddened onlookers gazing at the unseen rubble of the World Trade Center shortly after the 9/11 attacks. The soundtrack is composed of the National Anthem recorded in October 2001 at the Yankees' World Series Game 4 in New York.","popularity":0.2064,"poster_path":"/rC2hFXgEulefcMGnHR1yKL36zBq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O'Say Can You See 1","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":220691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Poitras","original_name":"Laura Poitras","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/gRCQMBVyEy7FlA6MAUJ0ESVobLp.jpg","credit_id":"6126a813ac41610042c16eaf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":220691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Poitras","original_name":"Laura Poitras","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/gRCQMBVyEy7FlA6MAUJ0ESVobLp.jpg","credit_id":"6126a81843250f008d8a87e5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":220691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Poitras","original_name":"Laura Poitras","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/gRCQMBVyEy7FlA6MAUJ0ESVobLp.jpg","credit_id":"6126a81dd705940045530a84","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":220691,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Poitras","original_name":"Laura Poitras","popularity":0.1409,"profile_path":"/gRCQMBVyEy7FlA6MAUJ0ESVobLp.jpg","credit_id":"59dc663f92514124cd06f597","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1742099","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1916,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qrBLvqCb7w78P2EipLsZycyUPxU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rC2hFXgEulefcMGnHR1yKL36zBq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
