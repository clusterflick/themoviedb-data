Personal thought patterns collide with societal demands, leading to thought loops that are reflected in a nonlinear narrative. The protagonistâ€™s discomfort is made palpable through a collage of bleak everyday fragments, dance exercises, music, and flickering effects. Between rage and despair, the feeling of isolation is explored. How can we change mental structures? Where do we find strength? The answers reveal a long, endless path.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I See Myself in Flames","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5065754,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ysbell Carolina","original_name":"Ysbell Carolina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673a7b5c119917bc1f5ea2d6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"41.
