His spectacular escape from human creatures that live in the woods,who have lost all humanity and turned into animals, leads him directly to a mysterious house whose owner will very soon confront him with his mad rage. The subtle dialogues between the two of them, will end in a carnage. At full tilt, the kinkiness of H.P Lovecraft's short story transforms into the transparent struggle of survival of a man who has lost everything in this post-apocalyptic world, a world that slowly wipes him out.","popularity":0.2745,"poster_path":"/ky6mE3BW84WdSxz94QwAyeMtOQY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215745,"logo_path":null,"name":"HENX
