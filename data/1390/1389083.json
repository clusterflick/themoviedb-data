The Dance of Icarus is a poetic documentary that offers an open space for reflection, like a tribal dance. Through the effort, passion and imagination of the artist José Benítez, the pictorial process becomes a profound relationship between the artist and the canvas, raising unanswered questions about creation. This documentary, loaded with symbolism, invites a total immersion in the creative process. Directed by Jesús Jiménez, this debut film is presented as an expressionist work that celebrates art in its purest and most visceral form, exploring the dimensions of artistic creation and its impact on the viewer.","popularity":0.112,"poster_path":"/nomC886sWQxjQ0AdyknsLjYcUlV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dance of Icarus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5063992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Benítez","original_name":"José Benítez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"673950cdc6412b3669650463","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5063988,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jesús Jiménez","original_name":"Jesús Jiménez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673950adc6412b3669650447","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5064002,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jesús Paco López","original_name":"Jesús Paco López","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673951c35859f981eedf9aaf","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3174882,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mario Ferrer","original_name":"Mario Ferrer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673951d66067cb94676a20d2","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3533923,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Juancho Crespo","original_name":"Juancho Crespo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673952096067cb94676a20e0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3244647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Morillo","original_name":"Luis Morillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6739521cbbb49f06a00d81fc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nomC886sWQxjQ0AdyknsLjYcUlV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1192}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":269412,"name":"poetic documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
