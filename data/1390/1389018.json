The documentary film Via Slovakia tells the story of an extraordinary tourist Slavomir Duchovič, who discovers the treasures of Slovak nature and culture. In 82 days, he walked the longest hiking route in Slovakia – more than 1 870 km along the Slovak border. He experienced crises, reached the end of his tether, overcame fear numerous times, yet he stood up and kept going. The documentary depicts the natural beauty or adrenaline attractions the area has to offer, but it is also an interesting personal story of the main character, whose journey helped him to cope with addiction and a troubled past.","popularity":0.0339,"poster_path":"/lO7Sf13agcdDTPBs69zDCGtzV5e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126774,"logo_path":null,"name":"FilmWorx Studios","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2024-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Via Slovakia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5072165,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slavomír Duchovič","original_name":"Slavomír Duchovič","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/wshzMb9NRGTyOgChDI7mOadl5Sb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"673ee7c4374a69952789787b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5063603,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Víťazoslav Chrappa","original_name":"Víťazoslav Chrappa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67390b5ead278a8963f854cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5072161,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Tomáš Bartaloš","original_name":"Tomáš Bartaloš","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673ee740e4decadef56c76fb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2500170,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Martin Dlugolinský","original_name":"Martin Dlugolinský","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673ee758e4decadef56c770a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1848853,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Viktor Krivosudský","original_name":"Viktor Krivosudský","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673ee769ce718434f38bee74","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5063603,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Víťazoslav Chrappa","original_name":"Víťazoslav Chrappa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673ee79e8e1abaf482db62b8","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":938,"iso_639_1":"sk","file_path":"/lO7Sf13agcdDTPBs69zDCGtzV5e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":663}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IFF Art Film Košice","release_date":"2024-06-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
