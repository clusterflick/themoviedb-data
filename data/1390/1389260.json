And people make mistakes. And yet, letting go is the hardest challenge when you're burning with love for the first time and want nothing more than to hold on to it forever. But can you feel as intensely forever as you did in the beginning? Così fan tutte in Benedict Andrews’s new production deals with the exuberant feelings that drive young love in the rush of hormones. Sometimes it touches the fringes of human relationships, where one threatens to lose oneself in the search for intensity. Thus the two young couples, who think they have already discovered the essence of true love, meet two experienced counterparts in Don Alfonso and Despina. An experiment begins in which the men put the fidelity of their partners to the test by playing a game of disguise. What remains is disillusionment. And the possibility of a painful realization: only freedom and the longing for union are certain. Disappointment and rejection are part of the game – because no love is ideal.","popularity":0.1485,"poster_path":"/cxPVFMzNwv3c4GKN5CP24LWh3Ml.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37841,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bayerische Staatsoper","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":237,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bayerische Staatsoper","title":"Così fan tutte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2140767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Alder","original_name":"Louise Alder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Fiordiligi","credit_id":"673a0232ad278a8963f877a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2559895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avery Amereau","original_name":"Avery Amereau","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":"/K3xgK6J7kmoloDOd7gVvq8ApiT.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dorabella","credit_id":"673a024373a45e5184bf8cd5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4317282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Konstantin Krimmel","original_name":"Konstantin Krimmel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Guilelmo","credit_id":"673a0258ad278a8963f877b8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4674738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastian Kohlhepp","original_name":"Sebastian Kohlhepp","popularity":0.0964,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ferrando","credit_id":"673a0269f741eb0428b60ba9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1563177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandrine Piau","original_name":"Sandrine Piau","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":"/oTvtZoc68tqNPoEvQLz8OUxw8TS.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Despina","credit_id":"673a027a73a45e5184bf8cea","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1422874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Gerhaher","original_name":"Christian Gerhaher","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Don Alfonso","credit_id":"673a0295209d43fbfb34823f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2149298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Jurowski","original_name":"Vladimir Jurowski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/p1paxEV6ITUXMaDKQuoJeIBBnvq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"673a02ac73a45e5184bf8d1a","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"673a02bd6067cb94676a2c19","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1369361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benedict Andrews","original_name":"Benedict Andrews","popularity":0.1519,"profile_path":"/27jOvReINol3O8sdc18TgsHYN1q.jpg","credit_id":"673a02d296be3a06fad95380","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":2346,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cxPVFMzNwv3c4GKN5CP24LWh3Ml.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1567}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
