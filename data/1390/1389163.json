As for the staging, we will welcome for the first time on Avenue Montaigne a Venetian who is used to the greatest European stages and who has undertaken his first Handel, Alcina, in the summer of 2019 in Salzburg with Ruggiero... Philippe Jaroussky. Everyone agrees on his ability to imagine delicate and highly effective dramaturgical worlds (his Barber of Seville for the Paris Opera is an irresistible visual translation of Rossini's frenzied score). His debut in opera seria with Alcina also showed his intelligence in giving coherence and emotion to the demanding arias da capo. On stage, a team familiar with the Théàtre des Champs-Elysées and this repertoire, led by a very fine trio of French women.","popularity":0.0523,"poster_path":"/7p1GuumnZv75zE0vzgts9HHN4HH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111244,"logo_path":null,"name":"Théâtre des Champs-Elysées","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":204,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Théâtre des Champs-Élysées","title":"Giulio Cesare","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1691830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaëlle Arquez","original_name":"Gaëlle Arquez","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Giulio Cesare","credit_id":"6739b332d28043e976e39a73","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1984412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabine Devieilhe","original_name":"Sabine Devieilhe","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/aoBEyy94TmLPXnKApgukLNqfmtk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cleopatra","credit_id":"6739b347ff0e18373ceed730","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2754603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucile Richardot","original_name":"Lucile Richardot","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Cornelia","credit_id":"6739b35d9c16dafa06f9cb28","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2148052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franco Fagioli","original_name":"Franco Fagioli","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":"/YBuTjY4XN87AIaaabVfk76NBqs.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sesto","credit_id":"6739b36dd17d5c34fbeed01e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2228836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlo Vistoli","original_name":"Carlo Vistoli","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Tolomeo","credit_id":"6739b37bff0e18373ceed743","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1892436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefano Salvatori","original_name":"Stefano Salvatori","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Achilla","credit_id":"6739b387c6412b3669650f09","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5064413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul-Antoine Bénos-Djian","original_name":"Paul-Antoine Bénos-Djian","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Nirone","credit_id":"6739b396443543191ccbdeda","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5064414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrien Fournaison","original_name":"Adrien Fournaison","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Curio","credit_id":"6739b3b0d28043e976e39ab8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Jaroussky","original_name":"Philippe Jaroussky","popularity":0.0784,"profile_path":"/7xgiiRWKSqS05p7RtbOc4y0SVzP.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"6739b3c0119917bc1f5e89b6","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73599,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Georg Friedrich Händel","original_name":"Georg Friedrich Händel","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/7vbMm0VcHE0vTlaU9BTLqILenM0.jpg","credit_id":"6739b3df119917bc1f5e89c7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572397,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Damiano Michieletto","original_name":"Damiano Michieletto","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6739b3f6c6412b3669650f63","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2339,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7p1GuumnZv75zE0vzgts9HHN4HH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1557}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
