It sounded like the roar of the wind, the hum of passing cars, or the sea breeze sweeping through the streets. It felt unfamiliar. The lights of the night, the towering and intricate buildings illuminated by smooth LED surfaces, come alive, dancing with faces and bodies. Seoul is a whirlwind—a devouring maw, a cacophony, a rapid stream of images that leaves your senses struggling to find focus. And so, I set out to trace this intriguing sound. One of them comes from the roof of my home. It originates from the wind and evokes the repetitive beat of a drum. On se souvient des pas begins here. Through a geographic and temporal journey as the camera transitions from one scene to another, the film encounters Korea's history and traditions. This is a kind of journal—an attempt to grasp the essence of this land where I lived for ten months.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/zRFfUvVNrp8nuE8kMlZlYEb1FuK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":242200,"logo_path":"/Tp5lpNmRdBAAOZApYQh6RL3jig.png","name":"Space Cell","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2024-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Turn a Door of Memories","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","title":"On se souvient des pas","type":"French"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"To Turn a Door of Memories","type":"English"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4653536,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lévana Schütz","original_name":"Lévana Schütz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6739da1ad28043e976e3a224","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zRFfUvVNrp8nuE8kMlZlYEb1FuK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2024-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
