Is a seducer always a cheat? Or is he himself being cheated on in return? Don Giovanni is the incarnation of the irresistible lover; a man who lightheartedly rushes from one conquest to another, who refuses to submit to any kind of moral claims on his person and who pays for his freedom with an incapability of forming an honest relationship with a woman or another person. Even his numerous mistresses are not really in love with Don Giovanni himself, but only make use of him as a mirrored image to project their own differing needs.\r Andrea Moses’ staging of Mozart’s masterpiece convincingly demonstrates how all characters are interested only in his or her own exclusive advantage. Lies and manipulation are everywhere with Don Giovanni as possibly the most honest person amongst them.","popularity":0.0347,"poster_path":"/rP9mjNyPSKFvOYsj3SvEi1YBXT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141234,"logo_path":null,"name":"Staatsoper Stuttgart","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":173,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Staatsoper Stuttgart","title":"Don Giovanni","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3196276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shigeo Ishino","original_name":"Shigeo Ishino","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/j1DuPQuJk2f13KWCEvn77Rz3D2U.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Don Giovanni","credit_id":"673a07ea443543191ccbf032","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2164466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Morsch","original_name":"André Morsch","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Leporello","credit_id":"673a07fabbb49f06a00d9497","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5064867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simone Schneider","original_name":"Simone Schneider","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Donna Anna","credit_id":"673a081a73a45e5184bf8f7c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3299346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebecca von Lipinski","original_name":"Rebecca von Lipinski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Donna Elvira","credit_id":"673a0830c6412b3669651c9d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1391114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pumeza Matshikiza","original_name":"Pumeza Matshikiza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Zerlina","credit_id":"673a084273a45e5184bf8f83","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Atalla Ayan","original_name":"Atalla Ayan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Don Ottavio","credit_id":"673a0853443543191ccbf072","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthias Hölle","original_name":"Matthias Hölle","popularity":0.0587,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Il Commentatore","credit_id":"673a0866443543191ccbf081","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5064868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronan Collett","original_name":"Ronan Collett","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Masetto","credit_id":"673a0876ff0e18373ceede28","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2392723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antony Hermus","original_name":"Antony Hermus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Conductor","credit_id":"673a088573a45e5184bf8f94","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18170,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","original_name":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart","popularity":0.1018,"profile_path":"/p4ueHlbsBraC1AMAGDCYJJ5L9cw.jpg","credit_id":"673a0898119917bc1f5e9708","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5064869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Moses","original_name":"Andrea Moses","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673a08b7bbb49f06a00d94f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2346,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rP9mjNyPSKFvOYsj3SvEi1YBXT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1562}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
