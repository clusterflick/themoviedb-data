Were they carrying out a covert exercise to create Europe's first independent nation-state, and there established a kingdom within a kingdom? Based on material from his explosive book First Templar Nation, bestselling author Silva reveals a previously unknown chapter in the story of these enigmatic knights. He explores the Grail, its location, the Templar's secret initiation chambers, and evidence that the knights practiced an ancient ritual in which candidates were \"risen from the dead.\" All this in the one place no one has ever thought to look.","popularity":0.0546,"poster_path":"/pJ5IGC3jTaNRP4qNmaa3EsKwpLF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 900-Year Secret of the Knights Templar - Part 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12734846","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.752,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pJ5IGC3jTaNRP4qNmaa3EsKwpLF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":564}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
