For him, the old Cambuur Stadium, in the middle of the residential area, is a place full of magic and solidarity. “Every two weeks, the most diverse characters come together in the stands, all with one shared passion: Cambuur.”","popularity":0.2545,"poster_path":"/uXYaFnMDyk1loHKXMkMt7jTAy4N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148408,"logo_path":"/wRn3oKQ1aNNfQSdVM36p9LoyESu.png","name":"Omrop Fryslan","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2024-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Het Laatste Fluitsignaal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5066836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivo Kraan","original_name":"Ivo Kraan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673b575bf0e974c26985fe45","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4557625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jelle Tigchelaar","original_name":"Jelle Tigchelaar","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673b59d22c0b7fd2034ac8aa","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5066840,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Willem Tiemersma","original_name":"Willem Tiemersma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673b59e52c0b7fd2034ac8c3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5066841,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marcel Tegelaar","original_name":"Marcel Tegelaar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673b59f2e831f8aa49e34f15","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2197343,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lars van Leeuwen","original_name":"Lars van Leeuwen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673b5a016a02a24d7b21ad0b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4664397,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Matthias Leemhuis","original_name":"Matthias Leemhuis","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673b5a29dc4bbc01c691e88d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Production Assistant"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8vewGfTnn6pohbB6nbFHp0oo7N6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uXYaFnMDyk1loHKXMkMt7jTAy4N.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13042,"name":"football (soccer)"},{"id":221103,"name":"supporter"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
