In Eaton Canyon, a highly trafficked hiking area in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains near Los Angeles, you can find a multitude of traces of the canyon’s own making—traces of geologic change, of jurisdictional decisions, of plant and animal life, of constructions built to last but now left in ruins. The artworks in this suite are imbued with traces not only of a particular moment in this canyon’s life, but also of their own making.  The suite of five works was made with support from Echo Park Film Center and funding from the Mike Kelley Foundation for the Arts.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eaton Canyon (1.2 miles in 50 feet)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1835326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kate Lain","original_name":"Kate Lain","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673b470a74a2e6e0237b6554","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
