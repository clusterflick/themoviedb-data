He is a nomad, travelling with his parents, grandparents and siblings through the Gobi Desert in Mongolia all summer long. They have to look after the animals every day. Khuyagaa helps diligently when the herd of horses has to be brought in from the pasture or the goats have to be milked. At the end of the summer, school starts again for Khuyagaa. He only has time for his horse in the afternoon. Together with his friends, he goes for a ride through the village and looks forward to the weekend. Because then he can ride out into the vastness of the steppe at a wild gallop again.","popularity":0.1006,"poster_path":"/sHbB3xcWWNQcEJSD4KOLf158yk4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108232,"logo_path":null,"name":"Makido Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Khuyagaa – Ein Tag im Leben eines Nomadenjungen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1602813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uisenma Borchu","original_name":"Uisenma Borchu","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":"/kLvw6afIw6YDgIetyqtinUHQmfF.jpg","credit_id":"673a2b84ff0e18373ceee6a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5065102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bawaa Borchu","original_name":"Bawaa Borchu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673a2b95ff0e18373ceee6c7","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1602813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Uisenma Borchu","original_name":"Uisenma Borchu","popularity":0.0713,"profile_path":"/kLvw6afIw6YDgIetyqtinUHQmfF.jpg","credit_id":"673a2ba5ff0e18373ceee6cc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1208348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sven Zellner","original_name":"Sven Zellner","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673a2bb36a02a24d7b218bb5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5065105,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alexander Thümmler","original_name":"Alexander Thümmler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673a2bc0d28043e976e3ae9b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1917743,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Pogo Kreiner","original_name":"Michael Pogo Kreiner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673a2bd7ff0e18373ceee6ed","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2809129,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Golli Marboe","original_name":"Golli Marboe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673a2be86a02a24d7b218be3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sHbB3xcWWNQcEJSD4KOLf158yk4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
