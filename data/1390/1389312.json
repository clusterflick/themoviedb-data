On both sides of the Atlantic, women were using experimental new mediums and questioning everything - from the way women were presented in magazines to their right to equal pay. Mary Kelly caused outrage in the tabloids by displaying dirty nappies at the ICA, Margaret Harrison's depiction of Hugh Hefner as a bunny girl resulted in her exhibition being shut down by the police, and in Los Angeles Judy Chicago told her students to only study work by women. The programme tells the story of these revolutionary artists.","popularity":0.097,"poster_path":"/gVC7N00gPc4a4Pp6yrmJCJrHq58.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rebel Women: The Great Art Fightback","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2101342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Chicago","original_name":"Judy Chicago","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/4p7OSpJJG8U9TloWCvGQNvstQnM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"673a1ab83c831a132953bcd4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1024258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rose English","original_name":"Rose English","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/yISP3NSdN1K49955kEO8DrlGjm5.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"673a1ad0ff0e18373ceee1a4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4681430,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clare Tavernor","original_name":"Clare Tavernor","popularity":0.0525,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673a1a9bf741eb0428b60dc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29517424","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gVC7N00gPc4a4Pp6yrmJCJrHq58.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
