Set in 1954, the film follows Esmeralda Arboleda, a fiercely intelligent leader, who ignites a revolution in a society rooted in patriarchal traditions, culminating in a fierce and decisive debate. A group of women embark on a historic struggle to bring women's voting rights to the National Constituent Assembly. With bold marches, radio appearances and a brilliant media strategy that places them on the front page, they achieve their goal, but the real challenge begins in the debate, where they face fierce opposition. Esmeralda Arboleda must endure personal attacks from the assembly members, and just as she is about to speak, she receives a heartbreaking call: her son has suffered a serious accident. She is torn between her duty as a mother and her commitment to the cause, with an unfavorable outcome.","popularity":0.697,"poster_path":"/yUS54e4fETzfIIwmwovbp2ya0di.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":245102,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Circo Films","origin_country":""},{"id":2586,"logo_path":"/nFBZvcFmGnokOMyz19gGumXhUYz.png","name":"Caracol Televisión","origin_country":"CO"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Estimados Señores","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Dear Gentlemen","type":"English title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1326228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julieth Restrepo","original_name":"Julieth Restrepo","popularity":0.2699,"profile_path":"/3srRo6tFFStWmZRhCA12sJRCWfk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Esmeralda Arboleda","credit_id":"673b4bfc443543191ccc27d8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcela Mar","original_name":"Marcela Mar","popularity":0.5259,"profile_path":"/2rlhrrn75n4Ed8SFRzZgu3A76Qi.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Teresa Santamaria","credit_id":"673b4e2bf0e974c26985fd78","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":866134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Castaño","original_name":"Paula Castaño","popularity":0.3226,"profile_path":"/xtzvf2tfHQ4RqLqA47MVjRZqJjw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Josefina Valencia","credit_id":"673b4e3bf0e974c26985fd81","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1633150,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Cataño","original_name":"Claudio Cataño","popularity":0.244,"profile_path":"/en1sFbBU9eK4137ig2mGgJ6zBKK.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ortiz","credit_id":"673b6427bbb49f06a00dcf33","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2374894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Toukhmanian","original_name":"Jacques Toukhmanian","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":"/WT82GkEFxCTwXrCAGBTwygH1na.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Valencia","credit_id":"673b6438443543191ccc2c1c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1113400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Castañeda","original_name":"Patricia Castañeda","popularity":0.1076,"profile_path":"/Au971IwNgfYiVhzw2twu3zYZhsf.jpg","credit_id":"673b4b75f0e974c26985fc9b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2252430,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sergio García Moreno","original_name":"Sergio García Moreno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673b4bba119917bc1f5eb48f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":965211,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Diego Rodriguez","original_name":"Diego Rodriguez","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673b4bd3443543191ccc27c9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1113400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Castañeda","original_name":"Patricia Castañeda","popularity":0.1076,"profile_path":"/Au971IwNgfYiVhzw2twu3zYZhsf.jpg","credit_id":"673b620ff0e974c26986008b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20882236","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"estimados_senores","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nCveeo0LwRejNG9op6qMV759mN9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/yUS54e4fETzfIIwmwovbp2ya0di.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1743}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":212915,"name":"women's rights"},{"id":222930,"name":"latin american history"},{"id":233514,"name":"feminist activism"},{"id":275739,"name":"women's voting rights"},{"id":285275,"name":"colombia"},{"id":301263,"name":"voting rights"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"16 Festival Internacional de Cine de Cali (Colombia)","release_date":"2024-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
