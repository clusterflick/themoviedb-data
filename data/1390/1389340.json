As she blossoms into full womanhood, she longs to know more about the world. One day a mutinous sailor swims to shore and declares that they are married, after tossing a pair of rings into the sea. He soon flees, but promises to return for her. Wealthy widower George Hudson, the richest man in the nearby port village, also falls for the fascinating, attractive young woman. He convinces her to go to a finishing school for a year and then marry him. They both find that the sea still holds a powerful pull on the soul. Which is stronger: love or the sea's magic spell?","popularity":0.1209,"poster_path":"/qy8gPr8wnZmUbcqEKTUJDotxxfT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unwelcome Mother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valda Valkyrien","original_name":"Valda Valkyrien","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/6VkhCO1Vd6frohe3e8UYm3agT1j.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ellinor","credit_id":"673a2bb0ff0e18373ceee6d3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1472249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Violet De Biccari","original_name":"Violet De Biccari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ann","credit_id":"673a2bbc6a02a24d7b218bc6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1310222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Law","original_name":"Walter Law","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":"/bHmTztQVKxtuMOii9MDHG5hv5yy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mason","credit_id":"673a2bc7d28043e976e3aea4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Evans","original_name":"Frank Evans","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Ship Captain","credit_id":"673a2bd5d28043e976e3aeb6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Webb Dillion","original_name":"John Webb Dillion","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"John Hudson","credit_id":"673a2be1ff0e18373ceee6f7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Warren Cook","original_name":"Warren Cook","popularity":0.0986,"profile_path":"/dSIjJucRiF4ZZ630CW3EARbRK4H.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Richard Russell","credit_id":"673a2bedbbb49f06a00d9dc8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3422214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Burrough","original_name":"Tom Burrough","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Old Peter","credit_id":"673a2bf9209d43fbfb3489a1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2977117,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian Devere","original_name":"Lillian Devere","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Housekeeper","credit_id":"673a2c02bbb49f06a00d9def","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1206898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Lee","original_name":"Jane Lee","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/j4i2EcXvI7kGpy8kJ1dNh9vlryi.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Hudson's Child","credit_id":"673a2c0fbbb49f06a00d9dfc","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1206899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Lee","original_name":"Katherine Lee","popularity":0.0941,"profile_path":"/6pCzmoTscHPVtQ6SNUFvTu2s9ia.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Hudson's Child","credit_id":"673a2c1b6a02a24d7b218bec","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1024981,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Vincent","original_name":"James Vincent","popularity":0.0523,"profile_path":"/bigHThNztXB7ErbOr75OpR4gx2q.jpg","credit_id":"673a2c3dbbb49f06a00d9e10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1488481,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mary Murillo","original_name":"Mary Murillo","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673a2c46bbb49f06a00d9e1e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545457,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"René Guissart","original_name":"René Guissart","popularity":0.1549,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673a2c63d28043e976e3aeee","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0007504","wikidata_id":"Q21183942","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qy8gPr8wnZmUbcqEKTUJDotxxfT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":339367,"name":"lost in the fox film vault fire"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1916-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
