Beginning in 1954, NYCB’s Artistic Director and co-founder George Balanchine presented the company in performances produced for Radio-Canada, the Montreal division of Canadian Television. These live telecasts capture legendary dancers in core works of NYCB’s repertoire. Serenade stars Jacques d’Amboise, Diana Adams, and Patricia Wilde. Balanchine himself appears on screen to discuss Orpheus, which stars Nicholas Magallanes and Francisco Moncion dancing the roles they created in the 1948 premiere, and Violette Verdy as Eurydice.","popularity":0.0794,"poster_path":"/31wEiPXvtI5NVMPlshI2rMDAYCF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Orpheus / Serenade","title":"New York City Ballet in Montreal, Vol. 1","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":138392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diana Adams","original_name":"Diana Adams","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":"/zgvUGAwl1a8FC7I2qX8DUG21xgb.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Waltz Ballerina (Serenade)","credit_id":"63ba0d5ba6e2d200db59e551","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3862723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Wilde","original_name":"Patricia Wilde","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Russian Ballerina (Serenade)","credit_id":"63ba0e13ae6f0900a0d1cea9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3862724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne Mounsey","original_name":"Yvonne Mounsey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dark Angel (Serenade)","credit_id":"63ba0e47f85958007d3532b3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1271243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Magallanes","original_name":"Nicholas Magallanes","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Orpheus (Orpheus)","credit_id":"63ba0e6cfa404600e63a6833","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2330445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Violette Verdy","original_name":"Violette Verdy","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Eurydice (Orpheus)","credit_id":"63ba0e8d875d1a0092e25888","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques d'Amboise","original_name":"Jacques d'Amboise","popularity":0.2671,"profile_path":"/sjgeqYKWLkYY2fGYzxhQrY500BV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Elegy Cavalier (Serenade)","credit_id":"63ba24bbf8595800c84a91c6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3862773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Bliss","original_name":"Herbert Bliss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Waltz Cavalier","credit_id":"63ba24d0a6e2d200920fd780","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3821056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Moncion","original_name":"Francisco Moncion","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"The Dark Angel (Orpheus)","credit_id":"63ba253f875d1a0092e2710d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3862775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Tobias","original_name":"Roy Tobias","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Apollo (Orpheus)","credit_id":"63ba2555f85958007d354c68","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248654,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"George Balanchine","original_name":"George Balanchine","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ba1a80f8595800c84a87f7","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3862774,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hugo Fiorato","original_name":"Hugo Fiorato","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ba24ee875d1a008b8d7748","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313817,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Irving","original_name":"Robert Irving","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ba2509fc31d300c59c0c78","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5HYbdtU6uf3ZGC4Tg8rwGLSxsIY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/31wEiPXvtI5NVMPlshI2rMDAYCF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":539}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Content created 1957/1960","release_date":"2014-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BALANCHINE: NEW YORK CITY BALLET IN MONTREAL, VOL. 1","key":"iN4EwgC8-Oo","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-06-30T23:12:22.000Z","id":"63ba0eeef8595800f71e0241"}]}}}
