Chaldea pinpoints space-time Singularities thought to be the cause of humanity’s extinction and executes a forbidden ceremony called Rayshifting, where mages are converted into Spiritrons and sent into the past to restore humanity.  Under the command of Romani Archaman and with the aid of numerous Servants, Ritsuka Fujimaru and Mash Kyrielight begin by restoring Singularity F: Flame Contaminated City, Fuyuki. From there, they make their way through seven Singularities, resolving each of them. And now, the path to the Final Singularity, Grand Temple of Time: Solomon, lies open, and the final battle against the King of Mages is underway.","popularity":0.6826,"poster_path":"/38PFCPjDOdnSCpT8hSgqM2B1gz7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":190039,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nappos
