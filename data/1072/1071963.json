Small flocks of sheep like the crofters of the old country wander on the hills and provide wool for spinning and weaving, while the plain-spired churches and the only Gaelic College in the world keep alive the faith brought from other highlands across the sea. Gaelic language is heard in the church, singing in community and casual exchanges between passers-by.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/yQKKPkZL1q4rcPPz93y4chETWiM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42589,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crawley Films","origin_country":""},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":190092,"logo_path":"/4o0TOP3n8cAXpW3kXBDTMSLDp3M.png","name":"Canadian Geographical Society","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":190093,"logo_path":null,"name":"Province of Nova Scotia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1946-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gaels of Cape Breton","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yQKKPkZL1q4rcPPz93y4chETWiM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1946-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
