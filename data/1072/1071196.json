The main specificity of this machine was that its movements are powered with the same motor that makes the camera film, making filming and moving indisociable. when you turn on the camera and the film started to roll, the camera itself started to rotate, in a planet that is also spining, revolving arround the sun in a whirling galaxy. The Chiasmic Entanglement between the viewer and the image turns upside down our bodies, making the phenomenological apprehension of the film at the same time physical and mental, disolving oneself in the complexity of forms of the branches, trunks leaves and vines of the forest.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spiral Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3153269,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Steegmann Mangrané","original_name":"Daniel Steegmann Mangrané","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ba1b49a6e2d200a865677d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
