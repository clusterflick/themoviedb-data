Not a story for twenty year olds, this one looks at how people find themselves living in one place, but notice they are happy in another place. A decision has to be made about staying in that unfulfilling loop or breaking out of it and embracing change. In this story, Carla shares her relationship disappointments with Leo, her guy buddy who listens patiently and supportively to her agonizing over frustrating experiences. Unbeknownst to Carla, Leo has concealed a passion for her and has decided to kidnap her away for a weekend at a quiet B and B in a last-ditch effort to convey this. With a couple of interesting twists, the weekend is about the captivating of Carla, and what her decision will be.","popularity":0.4701,"poster_path":"/aYKN6ZPJbJm9v7fHRHuemQPq4Nh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Captivating Carla","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3864360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bea Broda","original_name":"Bea Broda","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":"/gNKcPiP8T6fhjx0hyxTxRTOJhGv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Carla","credit_id":"63bbbcc5aede59007d25cbc0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2272114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kent Bradley James","original_name":"Kent Bradley James","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jesse","credit_id":"63bbbceafa404600e63b453e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1742901,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Vaccariello","original_name":"Greg Vaccariello","popularity":0.0773,"profile_path":"/axpvshnE3vvynE3oP23wS4214J9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Leo","credit_id":"63bbbd06fa40460087563231","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3864366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michele Marotta","original_name":"Michele Marotta","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Alice","credit_id":"63bbbe37fa40460087563309","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3864367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Dimora","original_name":"Al Dimora","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Bartender","credit_id":"63bbbe45ae6f093c82ed238e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3864368,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne Dimora","original_name":"Yvonne Dimora","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Hot Babe","credit_id":"63bbbe55aede5900da1f5fca","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3864369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Brooks","original_name":"Ralph Brooks","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Man at Diego's","credit_id":"63bbbe6aae6f093c82ed23ad","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3864370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Cutler","original_name":"Dave Cutler","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Jimmy","credit_id":"63bbbe7daede59009494a1ba","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3864358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Green","original_name":"Robert Green","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Man at Trick's Lounge","credit_id":"63bbbe95f85958007d360c4f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3864371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobbie Sizemore","original_name":"Bobbie Sizemore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Hostess","credit_id":"63bbbea4f8595800ae32e398","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3864358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Green","original_name":"Robert Green","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bbbcb0fc31d30092c546ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3864360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bea Broda","original_name":"Bea Broda","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":"/gNKcPiP8T6fhjx0hyxTxRTOJhGv.jpg","credit_id":"63bbbd6ea6e2d20083e1cd96","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3864358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Green","original_name":"Robert Green","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63bbbd82fc31d30092c54740","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3864360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bea Broda","original_name":"Bea Broda","popularity":0.0439,"profile_path":"/gNKcPiP8T6fhjx0hyxTxRTOJhGv.jpg","credit_id":"63bbbdc7fa404600e63b45df","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2522759,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry V.
