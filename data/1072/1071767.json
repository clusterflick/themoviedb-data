Over a century ago, hordes of cine-camera operators, both Italian and from further afield, travelled far and wide through Italy to film the landscapes, villages, cities, events, factories, customs and traditions of our country, for the benefit of a whole new category of person: the cinemagoer around the world.\r With this collection of 61 films, restored by the Cineteca di Bologna and other prestigious film archives, we hop aboard a machine travelling through time and space, stopping off at hundreds of destinations, from Sicily to Monte Cervino. Italy as weâ€™ve never seen it before, suspended between the nineteenth century and modernity, in the old and rare images that have survived. A Grand Tour, a journey of pleasure, of course, but also one that better helps us to understand the country today.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":289,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grand Tour Italiano","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
