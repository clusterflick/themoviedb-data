Iran enjoys one of the most productive film cultures of our time, yet what is less known by contemporary audiences , is the formative past of this vibrant cinema. The creativity, modern lyricism and social commitment of the filmmakers before the 1979 revolution is seldom remembered by the film critics outside the country. This film sets out to portray that the post revolution cinema that came to be recognized by the world was a product of Kanoon, an institution that influenced the artistic culture of several generations. Kanoon was a medium for filmmakers to express their socio political and cultural criticisms under the title of children's cinema. It gave rise to an aesthetic art that was itself a by product of that very historical embodiment.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":"/8PpYLFwhXLZdwr734po4k14T5Fx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2015-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kanoon","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3862700,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khatereh Khodaei","original_name":"Khatereh Khodaei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ba06638c0a4800ab004d64","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3862701,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Khatereh Khodaei","original_name":"Khatereh Khodaei","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ba0671fa4046007d4c333e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3743310","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":785,"iso_639_1":"fa","file_path":"/8PpYLFwhXLZdwr734po4k14T5Fx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fa","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"مستند کانون ساخته خاطره خدایی","key":"avB45GJZNhg","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-09-18T06:14:20.000Z","id":"63ba07728c0a4800ed80cbc0"}]}}}
