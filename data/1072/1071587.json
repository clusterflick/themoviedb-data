He has to leave Marie and his village in Corsica for the plains of the Marne where the fights rage. On the front, he is a stretcher-bearer and crosses the battlefield, at night, in search of the wounded. One day, while the trench is sorely lacking water, he is chosen to go to a well situated halfway between the French and German territories in what they called \"no-man's-land\". There, he finds himself in front of a German soldier who has also come too stock up.","popularity":0.2729,"poster_path":"/2aUxqoHOnmbBEWH32fuD7pzgiPJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11244,"logo_path":"/gCHH1xt3dKjlm9NuMPF9ekpPWD6.png","name":"France
