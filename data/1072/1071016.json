The shapes move and combine to create characters, vehicles and objects. Although there is no clear narrative as such, this cut-out animation has a fable-like quality. All the creations attempt to possess the moon, but it has a nature of its own and somehow none quite manage to get the better of it. A fabulous stimulus for creating your own cut-out animation.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/jXPjecJi8H2wASE9WvZRECNntUx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laughing Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Warau Tsuki","type":"Romaji"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3862115,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kiyoshi Nishimoto","original_name":"Kiyoshi Nishimoto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63b9814cfa404600c1278d16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2124085","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jXPjecJi8H2wASE9WvZRECNntUx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
