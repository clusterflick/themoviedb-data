Rock blunts scissors, scissors cut paper, paper enfolds rock. Each round is win, lose or –if both players choose the same ‘tool’– draw. We see not hands but a shadow-play of hands against a pale background, as the two antagonists display the tremendous skill that kids alone can muster in what seems impossibly fast motion. ‘Conceptual art,’ you say, the kind you could watch for hours, the hands as synecdoche not of the body but of two bodies in a rhythmic frenzy of elegant interaction and dissolution.","popularity":0.1184,"poster_path":"/As5g0SR4CHM1ru0vvkKaofi95Bh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children’s Game #14: Piedra, papel o tijera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Devaux","original_name":"Julien Devaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fc45cc390c500796f2682","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Devaux","original_name":"Julien Devaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fc43cc390c500796f266b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Alÿs","original_name":"Francis Alÿs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fc415ede1b000d975f103","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178640,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Félix Blume","original_name":"Félix Blume","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vd0eBlu10beahsxWTmxf102GZgf.jpg","credit_id":"640fc46c323eba00844a6f5a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/As5g0SR4CHM1ru0vvkKaofi95Bh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
