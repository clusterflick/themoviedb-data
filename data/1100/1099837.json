The film rests on dramatic contrasts – tiny bright figures against the expanse of darkness; a child who can barely see over the colossal tire he fights to push uphill. Then the adrenaline rush of rolling down inside it! Yet the song the kids invented “pushing, pushing” to solve post-industrial problems, gives faith in these young carriers of D.R. Congo’s future.","popularity":0.1159,"poster_path":"/k5A01syyzkJKuEb1ugk92RGiQft.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CD","name":"Congo"}],"release_date":"2021-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children’s Game #29: La roue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3287478,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rafael Ortega","original_name":"Rafael Ortega","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fd9a3a6c10400d8d77b97","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650025,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"César González Cortés","original_name":"César González Cortés","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fd9db323eba007cb7fe55","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Alÿs","original_name":"Francis Alÿs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fd95ae18e3f07d05500ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Devaux","original_name":"Julien Devaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fd9b0ede1b000bac02088","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178640,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Félix Blume","original_name":"Félix Blume","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vd0eBlu10beahsxWTmxf102GZgf.jpg","credit_id":"640fd9c1a6c104007905a161","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k5A01syyzkJKuEb1ugk92RGiQft.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CD","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
