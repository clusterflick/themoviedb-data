No bitterness, no unemployment and no right-wing radicals, but instead 60 people full of joie de vivre and warmth.  The people of Wrodow are proud of their castle, which was bought 6 years ago by a youth judge, his wife and the painter Sylvester Anthony from the West. It is the venue for opera balls, Venetian masked balls, modern exhibitions and concerts.","popularity":0.1173,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2000-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wonderful Wrodow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosa von Praunheim","original_name":"Rosa von Praunheim","popularity":0.2345,"profile_path":"/8KtgcbZmwtvyjATkPgGCD02GxPw.jpg","credit_id":"640dd92c323eba010b90ae1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0316905","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
