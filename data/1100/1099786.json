When one is found its hind legs are pulled off, though not its wings. Each child hurls his or her grasshopper up into the air, where it flutters against the sky above the upturned faces of the skipping, wheeling children. Unable to fly far, it will soon free-fall and be captured again. The winner is the player whose grasshopper stays the longest in the air.","popularity":0.1515,"poster_path":"/qiRjVcB0UGhMRfmWKkYPdF8sI24.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children’s Game #9: Saltamontes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3961939,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Benjamin Mast","original_name":"Benjamin Mast","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fbcf0e18e3f08403b312b","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Devaux","original_name":"Julien Devaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fbd08c390c500a4676f8b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178640,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Félix Blume","original_name":"Félix Blume","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vd0eBlu10beahsxWTmxf102GZgf.jpg","credit_id":"640fbd19e18e3f08403b3159","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Alÿs","original_name":"Francis Alÿs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fbdc5c390c500d71d4353","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qiRjVcB0UGhMRfmWKkYPdF8sI24.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
