The scratchy, chaotic aesthetic is created through Smith’s proprietary process of placing TikTok video stills onto 35 mm film, then rendering it in 4K as an artifact of the original footage. A driving, heavy metal soundtrack provides an apt audio accompaniment to the visual onslaught of nature’s rage.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/dtDB0yoYZzSXcfoEBusVBZPVFmg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Caldera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1094393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cauleen Smith","original_name":"Cauleen Smith","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":"/6K3c26NOrykUvTeeG8WGXHRJIyE.jpg","credit_id":"640e0b8ce18e3f07ac51da3a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dtDB0yoYZzSXcfoEBusVBZPVFmg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
