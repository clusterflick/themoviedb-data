In pursuit of this unique Queer history, two Rainbow filmmakers embark on a riveting social documentary that candidly explores the growth of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender identity in Christchurch in a compelling portrait of cultural metamorphosis and the right to create one’s place in the world.  Hard hitting, deeply honest, embracing and at times hysterical, we glimpse the scope of the human struggle and celebration that encapsulates how a community is defined and ultimately defines itself.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/jC3DCEUw47qqg87VANY3XxLOWag.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195717,"logo_path":null,"name":"Big Girls Blouse Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":195718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pink Health Ōtautahi","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2009-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How a Community is Defined and Ultimately Defines Itself","title":"Through Rainbow Coloured Glasses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3961196,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toni Keevil","original_name":"Toni Keevil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640f11d5b4224200b972c7ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3961197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meshell Edgecombe","original_name":"Meshell Edgecombe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640f11eaa6c104009afe2ee1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jC3DCEUw47qqg87VANY3XxLOWag.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":679}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
