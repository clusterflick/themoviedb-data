Cia marries him to soothe her heartbreak when her father marries her best friend, Lies. But when they go to Dono’s hometown for their honeymoon, they find his relatives acting mysteriously. Dono’s sister, Lastri, never speaks. His brother is insane and there is only an old woman whom he speaks to. On their wedding night, Cia realises that Dono cannot perform sexually, but Cia still loves him. One day when Cia is taking a bath in a river near the house, she is attacked and raped by a man. Dono tells her that when he was a boy, he saw his mother raped by Kromodongso. Later, the same person rapes his sister. Strangely, Kromodongso does not admit to have raped Cia, although he admits to raping Dono’s mother and sister. Finally, Dono admits that he raped Cia, his own wife. He did that, as he cannot perform in a normal situation. Dono can only do what Kromodongso did to his mother. Cia is happy because Dono is truly a man.","popularity":0.1885,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1984-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Moments You Lie on My Chest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1320239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoraya Perucha","original_name":"Zoraya Perucha","popularity":0.1109,"profile_path":"/eScDzJB1xLzGQvCouD4gTHnoH3D.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"640edad8323eba00ef6238fc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deddy Mizwar","original_name":"Deddy Mizwar","popularity":0.154,"profile_path":"/8SD3aon2Z3ozKwELxHHkjV9aYJm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"640edae72a09bc00f72d8ee0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1365819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maruli Sitompul","original_name":"Maruli Sitompul","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":"/j6ASMKJFs86r3D3vlzLYkZYHRpC.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"640edafeede1b000f8a23f96","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1685237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kies Slamet","original_name":"Kies Slamet","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"640edb0d2a09bc00f72d8eff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":563885,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sofia W.D.","original_name":"Sofia W.D.","popularity":0.1443,"profile_path":"/1qL3VfRqeURdTSpMJ9bAGaw4zaI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"640edb24323eba00ef623944","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2084127,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arswendo Atmowiloto","original_name":"Arswendo Atmowiloto","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640edba2ede1b000a2a1442a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2235992,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Satmowi Atmowiloto","original_name":"Satmowi Atmowiloto","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640edb8de18e3f07ac523380","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3951484,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Th A Budi Susilo","original_name":"Th A Budi Susilo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640edb43b4224200f7905512","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2320259,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"J Adisubrata","original_name":"J Adisubrata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640edb5eb4224200b972ac10","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3599974,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Djun Saptohadi","original_name":"Djun Saptohadi","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640edb752a09bc00e8455eb8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"id","note":"","release_date":"1984-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
