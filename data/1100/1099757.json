Since Keys lived in Cilento for his studies, Susan carries out her research in Campania where she has to interview the Italian nutritionist Vanni Proietti, who will provide her with valuable material for her article. The two meet in a restaurant where a casting of young aspiring you-tubers is taking place. Among them, there is Ciro, an overweight child, accompanied by his uncle Sas√†. And the eating habits of the two are the exact opposite of what Keys preached.","popularity":0.2866,"poster_path":"/aEFX0G7a6CBnosPf7OdZ5kDuRLg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Morol srl","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2017-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Food","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1343865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salvatore Esposito","original_name":"Salvatore Esposito","popularity":0.4099,"profile_path":"/lvTeMD1NqYmYbaH0jYek2oXaSvR.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"640fa7bba6c10400d8d7617f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1182567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justine Mattera","original_name":"Justine Mattera","popularity":0.1196,"profile_path":"/1FSY6G2XCI5Zfb41lsPKVfaokvz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"640fa864e18e3f07d054e8da","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giorgio Colangeli","original_name":"Giorgio Colangeli","popularity":0.2022,"profile_path":"/3LxOBPqDPT4k0CJ4hJGMSrYKtP1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"640fa88bede1b0007b4e511e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3961890,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annalisa Amodio","original_name":"Annalisa Amodio","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"640fa8aae18e3f08403b29e5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3961891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raffaele Fasolino","original_name":"Raffaele Fasolino","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"640fa8efaf85de00839129c4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3179017,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Corrado Serri","original_name":"Corrado Serri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fa9f1ede1b000d975e51c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3961892,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lorenzo Muto","original_name":"Lorenzo Muto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fa9ce2a09bc00f72dd3ed","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1387075,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dario Acocella","original_name":"Dario Acocella","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":"/7dkQvUNLRGL7eRCn2m0RyO8IkiP.jpg","credit_id":"640fa917ede1b000d975e4fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189164,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianluca Mech","original_name":"Gianluca Mech","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fcbd5b4224200d865b2ce","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1390114,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paolo Logli","original_name":"Paolo Logli","popularity":0.1021,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"648308e0d2b209010c184e88","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3076979,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alessandro Logli","original_name":"Alessandro Logli","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/eUPsfzXLGwxqr2NtF81MNqRs8oL.jpg","credit_id":"648308d7e375c000c526d4ae","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27126819","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aEFX0G7a6CBnosPf7OdZ5kDuRLg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":679}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
