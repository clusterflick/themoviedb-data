The child in the middle plays the lamb, the one outside is the wolf. The wolf tries to catch the lamb by breaking through the human fence, but the kids crouch quickly down, blocking him with lowered arms. If the wolf does breach the circle, the lamb can duck out of it, while the kids now try to keep the wolf imprisoned inside. At times the cheeky lamb provokes the wolf, rushing out of safety almost into his path and darting back in. The lamb may be caught, ending that round of the game, inside or outside the fold; but these kids prefer close shaves, the dramatic prolongation of suspense.","popularity":0.0959,"poster_path":"/z4ERFLGpqczyIkalx0g62qCrBDJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","name":"Afghanistan"}],"release_date":"2011-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children’s Game #11: Wolf and Lamb","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Alÿs","original_name":"Francis Alÿs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fbf982a09bc00866c42a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1652997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elena Pardo","original_name":"Elena Pardo","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":"/fsGnkqKFzkSLROeUcpN18KiXNkT.jpg","credit_id":"640fbfd7af85de00d9dbc316","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z4ERFLGpqczyIkalx0g62qCrBDJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
