No one at school knows much about this quiet and shy boy. Raymond is often used as source of amusement and entertainment by a group of bullies led by two popular boys. Raymond is made fun of and teased on the playground, in the halls, in the classroom anywhere a teacher is not around or when teachers have their backs turned. One day Raymond is accosted. As he pushes through the crowd of jeering boys, he runs into the street where he is hit by a car. Nobody meant for it to go this far...but it did. The video then focuses on the reactions of the bullies.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/sk7PbFGQ9uEgjHzQvOWOa4q04I1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Children cannot learn if they are afraid to go to school.","title":"Broken Toy","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3960368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Brown","original_name":"Thomas Brown","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640de745a6c104007904cd87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.721,"height":1110,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sk7PbFGQ9uEgjHzQvOWOa4q04I1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
