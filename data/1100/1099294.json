Most opera lovers had to be intrigued by the amazing hybridization of animation and the technologically complex use of \"The Machine\" to make these operas come alive with astonishing sets that are true to Wagner's intentions for his monumental ring cycle. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this video and wished there was another hour or two (like a Wagnerian opera!).","popularity":0.0846,"poster_path":"/fu4sweNcw6tiZBeXkmIz3hE8cYP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Wagner's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":266422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Voigt","original_name":"Deborah Voigt","popularity":0.1241,"profile_path":"/oofK3iDXS6FDclhHK8mDWwTWFC5.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"640e01581ac292007c3552bb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1248678,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"James Levine","original_name":"James Levine","popularity":0.1985,"profile_path":"/p6ujBSZMKTc2zNCytIvvg9NKL1D.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"640e0164e18e3f07e952aff5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1183533,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Carl Fillion","original_name":"Carl Fillion","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"640e01771ac292008555f5cd","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1028309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Susan Froemke","original_name":"Susan Froemke","popularity":0.1445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640e013e323eba00a2a6f22b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fu4sweNcw6tiZBeXkmIz3hE8cYP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
