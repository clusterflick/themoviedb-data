Four employees would die on the spot. Their descendants today revive the memory of this human tragedy which also struck 42 Madagascans.  Starting from a sordid social conflict, the documentary shows that the “Forgotten Saint Paul” mark the end of an era of “colonization”, a term rarely used for the French Southern Territories, but nevertheless close to reality.  This is the story of the Third World, as its discoverer, Yves de Kerguelen, named it.","popularity":0.2196,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":154855,"logo_path":null,"name":"Callysta Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":107374,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lavita Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"History Of The Southern Lands","title":"The Third World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1981330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabrice d'Almeida","original_name":"Fabrice d'Almeida","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":"/pCdxhCBYocWa8ygdk1LM2tYID4w.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"640feadc323eba00a2a7b92c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2584285,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Genoud","original_name":"Robert Genoud","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640feaa9323eba00ef62a605","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2041,"name":"island"},{"id":254,"name":"france"},{"id":158217,"name":"colonialism"},{"id":219392,"name":"indian ocean"},{"id":282633,"name":"history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2019-03-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
