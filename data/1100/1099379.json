We live in a continuous sensory bombardment of distractions that keep us in the role of passive consumers – a condition that has not exactly improved since the revolutionary 60s. What to do? And how do you film a notoriously complicated theory that attacks the very image itself? Artist Roxy Farhat and filmmaker Göran Hugo Olsson (‘Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975’) bring Guy Debord’s ideas into the 21st century. Guy Debord’s own (anti)films are given a modern counterpoint by satirical interventions in a visual work that is not afraid to criticise neither itself nor the cult around Debord and situationism.","popularity":0.1315,"poster_path":"/nE3ZC9HWjLQiOy10uSq79tYonDQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2023-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You don’t hate Mondays, you hate capitalism.","title":"The Society of the Spectacle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3960683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roxy Farhat","original_name":"Roxy Farhat","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640e2ff4a6c10400d8d6c0db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229501,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Göran Olsson","original_name":"Göran Olsson","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":"/l55m0yJyn491prBARC0vEXgxfGV.jpg","credit_id":"640e3007e18e3f07e952bbaa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.776,"height":1126,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wGlmwdRdgMygSNHRUUpp6cw6wte.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1533,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nE3ZC9HWjLQiOy10uSq79tYonDQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4ITnrszPCeJV51DGiphxrBeaoeX.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
