A little nostalgic for his native Italy, Geronimo runs a thriving cake boutique in 1950’s New York. Between an aristocratic customer and a humble delivery boy, will his daughters make the right choices in love?  Il matrimonio segreto, a dramma giocoso in two acts, is Domenico Cimarosa’s best-known opera. The first performance took place on 7 February 1792 at the Hofburgtheater in Vienna in the presence of Emperor Leopold II, who liked it so much that, after giving dinner to the whole company, he asked for a complete second performance - perhaps the longest encore in history. As with the best opera buffa of the 18th-century, it contains a plot full of impossible situations (might just one of the daughters be married already?), elaborate disguises and, of course, a happy ending.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/he5iqSaOg8wILksR0KLA9eEQWzt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il matrimonio segreto - Cimarosa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3962293,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giulia Mazzola","original_name":"Giulia Mazzola","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64105354ede1b028e84ce74a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3962294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Mandrillo","original_name":"Antonio Mandrillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6410535bede1b0287fdada7f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3962295,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veta Pilipenko","original_name":"Veta Pilipenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64105362a6c10400c0c58457","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3962296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Leone","original_name":"Francesco Leone","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6410536c323eba007cb832e3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3962297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marilena Ruta","original_name":"Marilena Ruta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64105372c390c500d71d87fb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3962298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jan Antem","original_name":"Jan Antem","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6410537ac390c500a467bad8","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3962299,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Davide Levi","original_name":"Davide Levi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64105386323eba010b91c835","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3962300,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roberto Catalano","original_name":"Roberto Catalano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64105390a6c10400d8d7b310","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/he5iqSaOg8wILksR0KLA9eEQWzt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
