With the support of Baghdad’s Ruya Foundation, Francis Alÿs had been working with the inhabitants of the border region between Iraq and Syria, embedded with the armed forces fighting the Islamist militias.  On the west bank of the Tigris, which had just been liberated from Daesh control, Alÿs documented a peculiar street game that he had heard of on a previous trip: a soccer game played without a ball, but with great skill, imagination and resistance by a group of young people, in defiance of the barbarous impositions of the Islamic State, an expression of passion and creativity that these young people were more than willing to reenact in front of the camera.","popularity":0.0674,"poster_path":"/AtDMAcdKFmKfqdb3OrYi8hyS9s9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"}],"release_date":"2017-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children’s Game #19: Haram Football","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3512034,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jorge Romo","original_name":"Jorge Romo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fcd3d2a09bc00866c4ca8","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Alÿs","original_name":"Francis Alÿs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fcd09a6c10400f761ff1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2263666,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Devaux","original_name":"Julien Devaux","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fcd172a09bc00866c4c8b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178640,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Félix Blume","original_name":"Félix Blume","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vd0eBlu10beahsxWTmxf102GZgf.jpg","credit_id":"640fcd28ede1b000f8a29a89","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AtDMAcdKFmKfqdb3OrYi8hyS9s9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
