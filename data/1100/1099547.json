Two people who depend on each other and drown in deep love. However, such a life would not last long, and ruin was creeping quietly, but surely, right next to them.","popularity":0.4973,"poster_path":"/qFOkfke3z8TPcWvIK6UtzwnxGkt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amazing D.C.","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Woman Who Violates - A Group of Fools","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":1701406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mao Hamasaki","original_name":"浜崎真緒","popularity":10.917,"profile_path":"/oQnSsleH2I5b4wOLgRkJhTGcaMv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"644f32c023a31402f57b8586","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130292,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fumio Moriya","original_name":"守屋文雄","popularity":0.2034,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"644f32f5c0a30802dd70190a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2083957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Misa Wada","original_name":"和田光沙","popularity":0.4487,"profile_path":"/vPJAeJmIU0oIWOAZRiiGEp5F0JR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"644f32dcc0a30802dd7018e3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshitaka Hosokawa","original_name":"細川佳央","popularity":0.1571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"644f32e335039802f5d4a48a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":572028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hideo Jojo","original_name":"城定秀夫","popularity":0.6245,"profile_path":"/mqeICd26IGA5KFKv9j8fdzyru2R.jpg","credit_id":"640f11c4e18e3f0816c3c97b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":572028,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hideo Jojo","original_name":"城定秀夫","popularity":0.6245,"profile_path":"/mqeICd26IGA5KFKv9j8fdzyru2R.jpg","credit_id":"644f334235039802ddd4bd4a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5snN9XSIVJq1xLCIy4VGKzDMnOp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/qFOkfke3z8TPcWvIK6UtzwnxGkt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
