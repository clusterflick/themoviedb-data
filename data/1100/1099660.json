Use of a homemade electric chair at St. Anne's and the incorporation of testimony about student-on-student abuse makes this documentary stand apart from other films about Canadian residential school experiences. This film will serve as an Indigenous historical document wholly authored by Indigenous bodies and voices, those of the Survivors themselves.","popularity":0.1965,"poster_path":"/df4sfzXqA2MAfSXDy7B6VOYJ3l9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cree","iso_639_1":"cr","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Jesus’ Name: Shattering the Silence of St. Anne's Residential School","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3961598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"​Susan G.
