Six children place five chairs in a row, facing in alternate directions. When the music starts, the players skip one behind the other around the chairs. When the music stops, everyone scrambles to occupy the nearest chair and one person is left standing. The loser carries a chair away, stomping out of shot to the left. The music starts again, and so it goes on until the winner claims the last chair. Then there is only an empty space.","popularity":0.0613,"poster_path":"/ysEpKonlJbzRgvxrjwrB7yYzqfs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children’s Game #12: Musical Chairs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1652997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elena Pardo","original_name":"Elena Pardo","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":"/fsGnkqKFzkSLROeUcpN18KiXNkT.jpg","credit_id":"640fc145b4224200f790a435","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1541922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francis Alÿs","original_name":"Francis Alÿs","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fc0fba6c1040082528fe4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1652997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elena Pardo","original_name":"Elena Pardo","popularity":0.0659,"profile_path":"/fsGnkqKFzkSLROeUcpN18KiXNkT.jpg","credit_id":"640fc0d9e18e3f07b423f35a","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2178640,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Félix Blume","original_name":"Félix Blume","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vd0eBlu10beahsxWTmxf102GZgf.jpg","credit_id":"640fc0eda6c104009afe61c3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3961948,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Beto Ruiz","original_name":"Beto Ruiz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"640fc13b323eba00ef628d2c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ysEpKonlJbzRgvxrjwrB7yYzqfs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
