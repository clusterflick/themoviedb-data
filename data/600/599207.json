Shot in the style of a thriller, this observational film combines the look and feel of a narrative feature film with a real life revelatory journalistic investigation into a campaign of killings. The film uncovers a murky world where crime, drugs and politics meet in a deathly embrace - and reveal that although the police have been publicly ordered to stop extra-judicial killings, the deaths continue.","popularity":0.1325,"poster_path":"/6CjAxc9raRWoCA5iQBR1SQf2qq0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the President's Orders","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2285012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodrigo Duterte","original_name":"Rodrigo Duterte","popularity":0.1571,"profile_path":"/l92T5KjtdFIXkGaXOqhserMXpSN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d108512c3a3682f68250fd9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1920121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Sarbil","original_name":"Olivier Sarbil","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/fKb60pTXgh2cLNd4HLlmX4gjoE9.jpg","credit_id":"5d0976ec0e0a2628abcb8d31","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2341830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Jones","original_name":"James Jones","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d09772c0e0a2630d0cb6b85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9338028","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":874,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nzGFoPZwAhd8ogB45GInruXKxaA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1554},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":874,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qmUN6PPfoy2tqtos0H3zTsZraHl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1554},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":874,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6C5zvhjvJ829rqVibk508BJ1pvr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1554}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":2217,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6CjAxc9raRWoCA5iQBR1SQf2qq0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Hot Docs International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2019-04-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CPH: DOX","release_date":"2019-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sheffield Doc/Fest","release_date":"2019-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Human Rights Festival, NYC","release_date":"2019-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
