Composed in the 1930s by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht, this is a mordant satire on capitalism and the inexorable industrialisation of a society in which the ultimate crime is not having money. In twenty scenes the authors tell the story of a city lost in the middle of a desert and run by three thugs; in Mahagonny food, sex, gambling and violence rule supreme.","popularity":0.262,"poster_path":"/4uQasG1aKVaTtGtqwJH5TlHMqA4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71879,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bel Air
