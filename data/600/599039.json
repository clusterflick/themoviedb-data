We've done a horrible job of keeping up with EVE since WrestleQueendom, despite being at their live shows - so we'll recap the main happenings: a week after WrestleQueendom in May, Kasey Owens was revealed to be the mystery assailant of Charlie Morgan from shows prior - and in June she dropped her last name and took the EVE title hostage. Kasey was given the ultimatum of returning the title tonight or she'd face the consequences - as well as lose her shot to get into this year's She-1. Anyway, this show dropped barely 72 hours after it happened, and there's more than just the live edit as we've commentary dubbed in, along with plenty of graphics. This is looking really polished. Dann Read (eyepatch and all) and initially Nina Samuels are on commentary tonight.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":18554,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"EVE Slayers In Spandex","video":true,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8975248","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
