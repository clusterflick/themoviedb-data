The wrestler of the victorious team will meet with the new champion, who will be crowned on the same show later. I guess it will be mentioned during the show, but a week ago Jessica Havok was removed from her name because she chose to record Knockouts Knockdown 2014 for TNA, which took place the same day, instead of defending her title against LuFisto during this show. The title is empty and we have a match between Athena and Lufisto.
