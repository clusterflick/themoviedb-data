Scared by the hard work ahead of him, he tries to find somebody to help him. Petre, a Gypsy young man seems to be the right person. After changing a few words with him, Vasile notices that Petre is upset because none of the villagers wants to be the Godfather for his kid. Vasile decides to baptize the child himself asking Petre in exchange to help him finish the ditch. In the evening, Lucretia learns about Vasile's decision and a new ordinary domestic fight starts between them.","popularity":0.1223,"poster_path":"/cTuSJoysuBzfaHiVoAOAwg1BCnY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2012-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ditch","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1113157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Titieni","original_name":"Adrian Titieni","popularity":0.1773,"profile_path":"/cXTDbbmrPXvxrznP2ZAGYzVv1hn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Vasile","credit_id":"5dea368727d9cc0013ea6821","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1124336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergiu Costache","original_name":"Sergiu Costache","popularity":0.1907,"profile_path":"/1xMR5zdTYtgXv8fEKj377kZLvmq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Petre","credit_id":"5dea369311386c0011598ef2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1779728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabriela Popescu","original_name":"Gabriela Popescu","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Lucreitia","credit_id":"5dea369b27d9cc0013ea6830","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666019,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adrian Silișteanu","original_name":"Adrian Silișteanu","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/nUQ5sS7sNwyfpmfWRBXhUkOkh0N.jpg","credit_id":"5ccc4f65c3a368693fd92b97","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1670526,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claudia Silisteanu","original_name":"Claudia Silisteanu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dea36ac27d9cc0013ea686c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1081061,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrian Sitaru","original_name":"Adrian Sitaru","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dea36bd3faba000191839c7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1666019,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adrian Silișteanu","original_name":"Adrian Silișteanu","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":"/nUQ5sS7sNwyfpmfWRBXhUkOkh0N.jpg","credit_id":"5dea36c83faba000191839e1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2000656,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrei Gorgan","original_name":"Andrei Gorgan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dea36d211386c0011598f60","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2651250","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cTuSJoysuBzfaHiVoAOAwg1BCnY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":254130,"name":"ditch"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ro","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
