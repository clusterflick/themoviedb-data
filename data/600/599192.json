Branches of pink cherry blossoms etched against a vivid blue sky are the starting point for this sensual visual haiku. Through a fluid application of electronic processing, Kubota layers, digitizes, slows, colorizes and ultimately abstracts the cherry blossoms, creating poetic transmutations of space and image. The mesmerizing and unexpectedly witty confluence of serene blossoms and energetic imaging effects—the transformation of the organic into the electronic—is quintessential Kubota.","popularity":0.1415,"poster_path":"/uPmzKbsfLNi3uQD5lmM9SQjQLDU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rock Video: Cherry Blossom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2301978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shigeko Kubota","original_name":"Shigeko Kubota","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cc9d008c3a36820b58a62e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uPmzKbsfLNi3uQD5lmM9SQjQLDU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8dV6X2td1yIr4bU8K8Q8fNndHxr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":244417,"name":"art installation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
