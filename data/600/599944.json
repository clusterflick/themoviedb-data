Faithful to Italy and not to the Duce, after the fall of the Fascist State in 1943 they are captured by the German army and sent to the lagers. On their return they found a completely different country, which did not recognise them as part of an unarmed resistance, relegating them to silence.","popularity":0.1006,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A History About Silence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2304576,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caterina Erica Shanta","original_name":"Caterina Erica Shanta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccdbb109251412bdf259375","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"67.
