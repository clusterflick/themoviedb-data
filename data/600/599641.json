The first is in te reo Māori, subtitled in English, while the second is in English, subtitled in te reo Māori. Both tell of trajectories of migration and settlement that predate the arrival of Europeans in Aotearoa, of crossing sea and land in search of a different future, carrying the accumulated practices of the past to new horizons.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/67W7iZT47iCyX3TKtfo9JPnIeQZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mai i te kei o te waka ki te ihu o te waka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeremy Leatinu'u","original_name":"Jeremy Leatinu'u","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccc32c60e0a262fcf011963","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/67W7iZT47iCyX3TKtfo9JPnIeQZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
