Here, the duo record a performance by a singer dealing in the profound social and cultural effects that television has had on modern human life. Images of the musician - over-saturated and recorded at a lower frame rate but duped at normal speed - are only apparent when he is singing. Otherwise, the screen is black, with only the sound of his guitar.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":114055,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZKM Karlsruhe","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Video Theory 3","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philipp von Doering","original_name":"Philipp von Doering","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Guitarist and Singer","credit_id":"5ccccd4e0e0a262fcd022cf0","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303842,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Dellbrügge","original_name":"Catherine Dellbrügge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccccd8b925141044e280b68","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralph de Moll","original_name":"Ralph de Moll","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccccdac0e0a262fb3023b7a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303844,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ralph de Moll","original_name":"Ralph de Moll","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccccda2c3a36836c1dc3376","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303842,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Dellbrügge","original_name":"Catherine Dellbrügge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccccd99c3a36836abdc41d1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303855,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matthew Geller","original_name":"Matthew Geller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ccccd5f9251410456280cef","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
