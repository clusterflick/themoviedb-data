For more than half a century the now 77-year-old Semotan has been successful at the intersection between art, fashion and commercial photography, with many of her sophisticated arrangements having become legendary. Semotan's sometimes controversial oeuvre is characterized by her strong personality and a continuous opposition to anything mainstream. Elfie Semotan, Photographer is an hommage not only to a great artist but also to the passion of photography itself.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/6DJejR0GuAVd1r9WmGZMpiUN5uf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Navigator Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2019-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elfie Semotan, Photographer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2207212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elfie Semotan","original_name":"Elfie Semotan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5cc9e3b79251415cd2ffc022","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1176763,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joerg Burger","original_name":"Joerg Burger","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/fMLrBKbMlCiowxEdGfwrwb7db2g.jpg","credit_id":"5cc9e3d19251415cd2ffc034","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15132018","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/6DJejR0GuAVd1r9WmGZMpiUN5uf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Preview","release_date":"2019-04-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
