We start the show with THREE TURNS coming out of nowhere. Heights joins Rivera's band without any explanation, Scott turns babyface in the same way, and Blake shows himself heelish to death before confirming his turn in the post-match. I do not hang at all on Su Yung's \"Undead Bride\" and the band is already becoming the new Office with ridiculous overbooking during matches. I feel like I'm in the minority, however, since Yung has been collecting champion belts everywhere since the end of 2016. Lastly, why protect Allysin Kay again and again when she only comes once every moons and has not been regular since 2012? At some point, we will have to put a definitive end to the Midwest Militia and just move on. Sassy Stephie rotten all of 2015 (and a good part of 2014) with her Office.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":25443,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WSU Unshakable","video":true,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9370010","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
