Rose on his side is on a good run and has not lost since the third Secret Show against Alpha Female. Yeah, Belle continues to not impress me and Rose seems to have trouble as soon as she does not have a good wrestler in front of her. She wins the match and that's all we'll remember. Raaah, we continue with this weird format apparently. Belle says we'll see the best of her from now on and I agree, not being there at upcoming shows is probably the best you can expect from her. Rose shows himself to be heelish and wonders why she is in the opener against a dung like Belle after defeating a joshi legend at United. She says that WSU has an interest in giving it what it deserves after all this work and that it is one of the best in the promotion. Rose seemed a thousand times more at ease in this role than in that of a brave babyface. I'm not saying that it should turn heel or whatever,","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":26557,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WSU Resurgence","video":true,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9269390","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
