She's already defended it at another event, but Saturday (May 28th) will be her first time aiming to keep the gold on home promotion turf. Rhia will put the belt on the line against veteran Jetta, who also was victorious at the last EVE event. Also confirmed are Kay Lee Ray, Pollyanna and Blue Nikita, and three more wrestlers making their EVE debuts - Erin Angel, Sammii Jayne and Martina. In addition to the title match, there will be a eight woman Number One Contender's tournament. Not all competitors have yet been revealed, so a big element of surprise hangs over proceedings. What shocks are in store? Pro Wrestling: EVE takes place at the Cre8 Lifestyle Centre in Hackney Wick, London on May 28th. More information can be found here and tickets can be purchased over at the EVE website.","popularity":0.0218,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":33244,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"EVE In London: After The Storm","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9485054","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
