Nothing is created, nothing is destroyed, everything is transformed. The ports of small towns in Italy, are different. They have changed, over the years. Deeply changed. Yet, their richness hasn't changed. They are rich in mankind, so varied and bursting, noisy and tireless. Multi ethnic: north African people, Ceylonese people, Indians, Egyptians. It's wrong to claim that something, once change occurs, should be considered â€œdead\". Traditions won't perish as long as we hear those raucous voices, that peculiar expression, the accent of those \"oldies\" we've grown up with and who are still working with the same courageous old-time determination. And in spite of everything.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PescAmare","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8094642","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
