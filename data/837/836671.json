In Mein Kampf, Hitler outlined his political ideology and goals for Germany. Today, Mein Kampf is still available in libraries, on the Internet, at universities and even at bookstores worldwide.  Yet much of the history of this 720-page, two-volume screed is now forgotten. Using historical footage, photographs and interviews with scholars, Ascent of Evil plunges deep into the infamous blueprint for evil’s dark secrets and reveals how this book came to be written and its impact on world.","popularity":0.1068,"poster_path":"/8Jo7sGYmnWuEiEKfpoDVNWH2gC7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":197477,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pallas TV Production","origin_country":""},{"id":197478,"logo_path":null,"name":"EPF Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ascent of Evil: The Story of Mein Kampf","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2869630,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédéric Monteil","original_name":"Frédéric Monteil","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60b94fdc6dea3a006f748650","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.721,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/8Jo7sGYmnWuEiEKfpoDVNWH2gC7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1082}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
