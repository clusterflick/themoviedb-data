A flood of colours emanating from video feedback, warring tribes displayed through a modified oscilloscope, and a flurry of gun violence repeated via luminance keying dominate stations one by one. Abstract imagery through analog video glitch techniques forewarn the passive television viewer that the far-right American political system to come will not be the result of a sudden shift. Instead we will see a rise of increasingly conservative policies followed by a moulding of public perception by broadcast television.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/id42tLDA0nnzkyYFxhFCg5H1Fwu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tune in for a Clearer Picture","title":"Cable Box","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Feulner","original_name":"Rob Feulner","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/mm6iKUFnQMvbyVpczhFlX2prcAI.jpg","credit_id":"60b912d7ede1b0002a21a987","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2054236,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sacha Ratcliffe","original_name":"Sacha Ratcliffe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f5fefd4c25921a80e26f9c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Feulner","original_name":"Rob Feulner","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/mm6iKUFnQMvbyVpczhFlX2prcAI.jpg","credit_id":"60f5fedde72fe80074935681","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3164122,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Maturo","original_name":"Nick Maturo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f5feebf1759c005f321e6d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1570605,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bernard Gariépy Strobl","original_name":"Bernard Gariépy Strobl","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/m4UAdmvJdZNqiCmU0o9ZFphoBla.jpg","credit_id":"60f5ff13e263bb004742d937","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3164125,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Max Séguéla","original_name":"Max Séguéla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60f5ff377b7b4d00455ad1c8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/id42tLDA0nnzkyYFxhFCg5H1Fwu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"L","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Ecrã / https://www.robfeulner.com/cable-box","release_date":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Cable Box trailer (2021)","key":"AszPBOFhT_A","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-04-23T19:39:24.000Z","id":"66394b2666565a012816b509"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Cable Box (full film)","key":"403129709","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2020-04-02T00:17:32.000Z","id":"66394afe813cb6012189b5da"}]}}}
