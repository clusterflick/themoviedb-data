In this film we try to make everyone understand the core idea of a selfreliant india, but people should also understand the essence behind the idea. The tagline of my film is u should not depend on anyone for your need, starting from a glass of water, to a dose of medicine we should not depend on any other country. This film is about those people who sometimes try to explain others, where as they never follow that in their own life. This film beautifully narrates self dependency to a child.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/yQkDvEPm9sUv2j8Qoln9qbG2INq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Marching Towards Atmanirbharta","title":"Am I Film","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3111543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Porombir Paul","original_name":"Porombir Paul","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Bubu","credit_id":"60b72e2a839d9300578bbb6d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3111547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abhijit Ashok Paul","original_name":"Abhijit Ashok Paul","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zANzuu0HUQB8yW2lqoGxRN2NwWR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sona Kakai","credit_id":"60b72e5b57d378005986a829","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3111548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajesh Karmakar","original_name":"Rajesh Karmakar","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sir","credit_id":"60b72e73f44f27005811244e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3111551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milan Paul","original_name":"Milan Paul","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Chhordi","credit_id":"60b72e9ef44f27002944b6eb","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3111547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abhijit Ashok Paul","original_name":"Abhijit Ashok Paul","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/zANzuu0HUQB8yW2lqoGxRN2NwWR.jpg","credit_id":"60b7327618b7510058056fc0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3111566,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sohini Mukherjee","original_name":"Sohini Mukherjee","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/hZ5Q1mze6VTOuTazsqfumVgaW8L.jpg","credit_id":"60b7332fabf8e2002bde07ad","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3111567,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rupam Roy","original_name":"Rupam Roy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/82BHAZ9Ur2lcrZzFMd3WxqC23Ha.jpg","credit_id":"60b7334a6dea3a002a66624c","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aKLRN7iuZOtDdbY7dQjDcMa8byC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yQkDvEPm9sUv2j8Qoln9qbG2INq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"bn","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
