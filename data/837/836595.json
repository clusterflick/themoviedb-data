The royal couple Heinrich and Kunigunde make the plan to establish a diocese, with Bamberg at its centre. During the imperial synod in Frankfurt in 1007, the bishops approve the plan. Heinrich transfers his royal court Forchheim together with 14 villages, including Wellerstadt, to the diocese.\r As “Waldrichesbach”, Wellerstadt is not only presumably earlier mentioned in documents than Baiersdorf but is in fact older than Baiersdorf. A once presumably Thuringian settlement at the river Regnitz has by now become the district of the small Franconian town of Baiersdorf: Founded at a ford, destroyed during the Thirty Year’s War, rebuild, often flooded by the Regnitz, pushed back and forth between the diocese and the margraviate. Waldrichesbach has turned into Wellerstadt, an endearing small village in Middle Franconia.","popularity":0.2181,"poster_path":"/mV1aWNPfxyUH2BKhMvMomEgSHqc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155320,"logo_path":null,"name":"azuca-TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"a film by Rüdiger Baumann and Gustavo Yánez","title":"1000 Years of Wellerstadt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3113209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rüdiger Baumann","original_name":"Rüdiger Baumann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"60b920be907f260029d894d7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3113212,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rainer F.
