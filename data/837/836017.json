All I did with the material was work with arrangements of frames along a timeline to setup what Eisenstein called “collisions” (for him a colliding of shots, for me, a colliding of frames). On rare occasions, Eisenstein substituted the word “copulation” for the word “collision” in describing the dynamics of his montage theory. In The After Life, it’s all copulation all the time. Bodies attract, bodies intersect and new creatures stream forth. In The After Life uninhibited promiscuity is what makes the world go round. It can’t be all bad.” (FW)","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/eHJFqSjbeSWBwexfZFev81nCAxL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The After Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1304442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Worden","original_name":"Fred Worden","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/ivSbWknJuBAioE3dHO5kz21hNup.jpg","credit_id":"60b6fe4beda4b7002ad7cf1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":941,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eHJFqSjbeSWBwexfZFev81nCAxL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":627},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9tWMvDqMONWwGj5QXIUdeyEtBc3.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
