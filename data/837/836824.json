Starting from the viewpoint of a bear, before freely shifting scale and perspectives, Everything invites us to inhabit the positions of other beings – whether a mushroom, an atom, a mountain, a butterfly, a rock, a bacterium, a blade of grass, or a galaxy.  Narrated by British philosopher Alan Watts (1915 - 1973), this exercise in perception celebrates the interconnectedness and subjectivity of all life. There is no narrative or story, only the universe as you see it, and the universe as it sees itself.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
