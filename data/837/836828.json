BMB (Black, Muslim and Bi) is a compilation of four poems where Dafne C. learns how to forgive, forget, and re-love themselves. Life is not easy when everything, and everybody, is telling you that who you are is wrong. BMB (Black, Muslim and Bi) explains the states Dafne C. went through before finally coming to accept who they really are.
