A sorrow shared, is a sorrow halved.” The two queer artists took a shine to the idiom as they considered ways to subvert traditional notions of authorship and the experimental canon in their practice and their teaching.  The “sorrow” of singular creative genius that is often hailed in the experimental world felt counter to the lessons they were bringing to their students and to their approach to making queer art.  For one year, Gabby and Hogan took the same strip of 35mm clear leader and passed it back and forth every month. There were no restrictions on how to interact with the strip or limitations on materials. The artists were simply responding to each other through gestures.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sorrow Halved","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3006551,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hogan Seidel","original_name":"Hogan Seidel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604a37ab6cf3d5005bf8b1bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2620696,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabby Follett Sumney","original_name":"Gabby Follett Sumney","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604a37d566a0d3005a80d1ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
