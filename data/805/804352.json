A meteorite named Akaba, which fell near Ma'an, Jordan in 1949, reveals the story. There, before opens with an anecdote inspired by the proto science fiction narrative, \"Awaj bin Anfaq\" written by the 13th century thinker Zakariya Al-Qazwini, about a being that comes to earth from a distant planet.
