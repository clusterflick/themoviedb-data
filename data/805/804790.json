The machines, with their sonority, rhythms, tunes and automated movements, become musicians and dancers in a show that drive the film to play its cinematic score. The soundtrack, composed with workshops sounds only, unfolds as a musical masterpiece performed by machines for iron and bolt dancers, all coming together in a majestic mechanic choreography. The man who conceived and created these « iron monsters » occupies a fragile place in this powerful, metallic world, which is at the same time incredibly beautiful and musical.","popularity":0.1419,"poster_path":"/8m7qpgaC7Kztb1geR8wibaocKgL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150566,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gachot Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music Boxes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":67019,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Stéphane Kuthy","original_name":"Stéphane Kuthy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604a5f54c8a5ac004576acf6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1033118,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Balthasar Jucker","original_name":"Balthasar Jucker","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604a5f3dd8e22500455863e1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":65460,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Gachot","original_name":"Georges Gachot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/9rS8UQEru5kWmqaG8UTet5LyPMC.jpg","credit_id":"604a5e005f622b002afc4549","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Music-Boxes-2051327245097294","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":2819,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8m7qpgaC7Kztb1geR8wibaocKgL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mostra de Sao Paulo","release_date":"2017-11-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
