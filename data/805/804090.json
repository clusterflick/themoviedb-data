When suspicious packages are found in a small town in northern California, Game Warden Pat Freeling, gets a tip about the peculiar activity. After further investigation he exposes a vast network of illegal plant poachers. These smugglers ravage the landscape as they rip thousands of the native succulent, Dudleya Farinosa, from their natural habitat. This small unassuming plant carries a hefty bounty on its head internationally, where a single succulent boasts a price tag in the thousands. With the help of volunteers, native plant biologists, and local government, they fight to stop this ecological destruction.","popularity":0.5226,"poster_path":"/rBGQpmarunyEKGqNH2ZImxUrV17.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196898,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sibling Rivalry Creative","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plant Heist","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3988574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Officer Patrick Freeling","original_name":"Officer Patrick Freeling","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"642761a0960cde009a96fd6d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3004138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chelsi de Cuba","original_name":"Chelsi de Cuba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642761e3c0442901e816bb3f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2881680,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gabriel de Cuba","original_name":"Gabriel de Cuba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642761c0960cde0103a44a92","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2881680,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gabriel de Cuba","original_name":"Gabriel de Cuba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64276028e2ff3200d3f25d7a","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3004138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chelsi de Cuba","original_name":"Chelsi de Cuba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6047b6b615c636004623af71","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2881680,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gabriel de Cuba","original_name":"Gabriel de Cuba","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6047b6ab9e458600243b6ff0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14039806","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"plantheistfilm","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ehUqTUBTdc5BsqLGRGAXee9Kutk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rBGQpmarunyEKGqNH2ZImxUrV17.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jtUUBe8HZ9Svx8b2kC5rnm2XB5H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6212,"name":"smuggling (contraband)"},{"id":10051,"name":"heist"},{"id":211505,"name":"wildlife conservation"},{"id":283199,"name":"poaching"},{"id":315372,"name":"succulents"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"South by Southwest Film Festival","release_date":"2021-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Plant Heist - Succulent Smuggling Documentary (SXSW Official selection)","key":"qidgwbCPhNA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2022-02-08T18:50:34.000Z","id":"642764798de0ae00978c855a"}]}}}
