Created under self-destructive circumstances and sleepless nights, the film weaves emotion through three individually crafted songs. Together, they form a fragmented escape from the grip of depression. Through the eyes of a fragile artist, the world appears cold and indifferent. Because art is not a choice — it’s an obsession, an addiction. But how do you live with a part of yourself that you are doomed to destroy?","popularity":0.37,"poster_path":"/vCqJei3BAu06e9wCOw42dtsiXRh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150555,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wisholm FILM","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2021-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's not always easy to give up","title":"The Wide Open Project","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3004037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Verwold Nielsen","original_name":"Oliver Verwold Nielsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/mQkXekYdy0lUxEyOkvmLkSry5FO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6047a6cf0102c90044f0eea3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3004037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Verwold Nielsen","original_name":"Oliver Verwold Nielsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/mQkXekYdy0lUxEyOkvmLkSry5FO.jpg","credit_id":"6047a767ea37e0005a3d3420","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3004037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oliver Verwold Nielsen","original_name":"Oliver Verwold Nielsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/mQkXekYdy0lUxEyOkvmLkSry5FO.jpg","credit_id":"6047a74ed185720043365455","department":"Sound","job":"Musician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3004038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Birk Wisholm","original_name":"Oliver Birk Wisholm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/pEanf852p710RsEr74bfX8IQQKF.jpg","credit_id":"6047a75cc8a5ac00304cc48f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3004038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Birk Wisholm","original_name":"Oliver Birk Wisholm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/pEanf852p710RsEr74bfX8IQQKF.jpg","credit_id":"6047a6e95f622b005988b62d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3004038,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oliver Birk Wisholm","original_name":"Oliver Birk Wisholm","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/pEanf852p710RsEr74bfX8IQQKF.jpg","credit_id":"6047a7739e458600243b5a27","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14024112","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ukEO6R3ltjbJBIt5WHOWWw3WMII.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":804,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r40yA9otZ8UCHNHovBcR2YXVuNg.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1430}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2729,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vCqJei3BAu06e9wCOw42dtsiXRh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1820}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":894,"name":"depression"},{"id":4232,"name":"melancholy"},{"id":9819,"name":"visual effect"},{"id":159315,"name":"mental health"},{"id":256343,"name":"visual album"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
