Arturo Albarrán and Clifton Ross, gives voice to much-needed alternative perspectives on the country’s Bolivarian Revolution. Heavily disseminated Bolivarian propaganda presents a narrative of a popular, left-wing government that has brought great benefits to the population in the face of attacks from a right-wing, “fascist” opposition. Through interviews with social movement activists, journalists, and academics, the film provides a counternarrative that helps explain the current rebellion against a corrupt, inefficient authoritarian government that has created a catastrophe in Venezuela that has brought it to the brink of civil war.","popularity":0.197,"poster_path":"/sCCk9PztQ9Pj6kxnSOdLoetdM0u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14681,"logo_path":null,"name":"PM Press","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Shadow of the Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2448782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clifton Ross","original_name":"Clifton Ross","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6049a418d8e225004557d0db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2448782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clifton Ross","original_name":"Clifton Ross","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6049a4328741c400460789c0","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3006120,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.
