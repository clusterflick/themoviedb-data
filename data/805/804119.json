Disappointed with the lie that has been her life, she decides to start over. She moves to a new neighborhood and begins to learn to value her own talents, such as the delicious dried fruit cakes that she used to give to her friends or the charities that she now sells in the neighborhood wineries.  The new space in which her life passes has new colors, and also new sounds: one day she hears a Marinera (the most popular of Peruvian folk dances) and she is drawn to the place she came from: a dance academy.
