One such sequence includes the victims of the 1904 Slocum Disaster, the reclaiming of their bodies and the funeral service at their church - which is still stands today - all of which were captured in vintage Edison ‘Newsreel“ footage,.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/uG8ntIomBCsaW6XPRbw6ka5zErV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Divine Comprehension","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3006082,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Devensky","original_name":"David Devensky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604b08dc90b87e0058ee7e5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uG8ntIomBCsaW6XPRbw6ka5zErV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
