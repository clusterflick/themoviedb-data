One pilot spends 14 years building the airplane of his dreams, only to suffer a crash landing that destroys the aircraft-- but not his determination. An aerobatic pilot flies circles around her competition in a man’s world. A pilot reveals the secret fears that nearly all pilots have of flying, and how that keeps them alive. Filled with seasoned wisdom and candid humor, The Disciples of Flight re-defines what it is to be a pilot who is truly in love with aviation. Join us as we seek to understand what it feels like to fly a small airplane, why people are so driven to aviation, and how the life long devotion some aviators feel toward flying has changed their lives forever.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Disciples of Flight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11608198","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
