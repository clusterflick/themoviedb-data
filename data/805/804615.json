More than 25 years after her death, seven recorded tapes from her last interview, which were made with Helit Yeshurun, are discovered. In these tapes, Wallach confesses to her attraction to madness, her experiments with drugs, her relationship with god and about the dangers of writing. The film weaves her testimony with interviews, with rare archival footage, with her poems and with animation that revives Wallach's thoughts, images and visions.","popularity":0.0856,"poster_path":"/wy5ATUa7V9Pdyolq25zDhZzIEMC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Seven Tapes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3006168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yona Wallach","original_name":"Yona Wallach","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6049ba3cd8e225006f3ddf11","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1577452,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Yair Qedar","original_name":"Yair Qedar","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6049ba59439be100769e4904","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3006169,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yael Badrashi","original_name":"Yael Badrashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6049ba67439be10026578410","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3782890","wikidata_id":"Q56458840","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1218,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wy5ATUa7V9Pdyolq25zDhZzIEMC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":812}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2012-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"העברים מציגים: שבעת הסלילים של יונה וולך","key":"aL5OpesMo-M","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2016-05-20T05:10:43.000Z","id":"6049bb894284ea005ae4c1bc"}]}}}
