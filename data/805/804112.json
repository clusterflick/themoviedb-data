The film follows the hardscrabble day-to-day exploits of a nameless hero as he is trying to survive amidst violent, desperate men and desolate landscapes. Later we will watch them all again building a metal construction out in the desert. So these men here will find an Asian guy, almost dead: “You have got a point!” The Promised Land? No, and it is someone else who will die in the end. Or will simply end up in hallucinations.","popularity":0.056,"poster_path":"/sNDZq1bxbm6OjFTnN5k2rJlNY2V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"East End","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3004183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Chave","original_name":"Graham Chave","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6047bdfbd185720043367131","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3004184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willy Brister","original_name":"Willy Brister","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6047be05ea37e0002ad008cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3004185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wayne May","original_name":"Wayne May","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6047be1284f249005a578ae4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Kumai","original_name":"隈井士門","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/8DExh2TlQRz6is3mCiEBRlBppwZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64a74fbc957e6d00ff1c7e70","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4150463,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dun Dudden","original_name":"Dun Dudden","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"64a74fc4f9253200ca3a3a21","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4150464,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Jackson","original_name":"Ian Jackson","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"64a74fd7f056d500e28b7db5","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3006884,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Usui Junichi","original_name":"Usui Junichi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662ac77e175051011e788dd1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1746777,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenji Onishi","original_name":"大西健児","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/kL0hv7pNJM83XYoByGsMQQdcpb.jpg","credit_id":"6047bdb990fca3006f765721","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/61cIKDOlICxRPLHJVxkr5GImAbs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sNDZq1bxbm6OjFTnN5k2rJlNY2V.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/1hYsVAxJIwBQZhCosAjiavv7uRr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
