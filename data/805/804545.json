The black and white aesthetic of shadow play and the light takes us back to the origins of cinema, until the magic of its lanterns.  The film is being made, in front of the viewer. The haunting music suspends time.  Kami Hitoé is a tensioning of the body and the imagination.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/8SyYraEnLgsMAx7WqN7RiFoo47Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lebel Ombres","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":150628,"logo_path":null,"name":"Calvacréation","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Side by side on a wire, between the two, a sheet of paper, very thin.","title":"Kami Hitoé","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3005900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yumi Fujitani","original_name":"Yumi Fujitani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"6049693254508d007759408c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3005902,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fabrice Croizé","original_name":"Fabrice Croizé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60496979c8a5ac006fff894f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3005904,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anthony Carcone","original_name":"Anthony Carcone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6049699c90fca3005a8a0348","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3005903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabrina Montiel-Soto","original_name":"Sabrina Montiel-Soto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6049698fb7a154006e8f6ac9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3005903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabrina Montiel-Soto","original_name":"Sabrina Montiel-Soto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60496989d8e2250025e01e15","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1590432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carole Arcega","original_name":"Carole Arcega","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/7LepEFrruJX9TqvamTGGr1odYmL.jpg","credit_id":"6049693e90fca3006f784d9f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1590432,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carole Arcega","original_name":"Carole Arcega","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/7LepEFrruJX9TqvamTGGr1odYmL.jpg","credit_id":"60496968ec455200457d3ca8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3005900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yumi Fujitani","original_name":"Yumi Fujitani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604969a8ea37e0004542248c","department":"Crew","job":"Choreographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3005901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabrice Croizé","original_name":"Fabrice Croizé","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604969735f622b00446996d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1FXO2dn8HyN5ogW7J5EX8Q9mVmn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8SyYraEnLgsMAx7WqN7RiFoo47Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"François-Mitterrand Library","release_date":"2007-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"KAMI HITOE","key":"9443652","site":"Vimeo","size":480,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2010-02-14T15:35:26.000Z","id":"60496acb1d78f20043e37680"}]}}}
