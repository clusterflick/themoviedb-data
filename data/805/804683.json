He is famous not only for his classic works such as Doctor Aybolit, Adventures of Captain Wrongel and Treasure Island, but also for his multifaceted vivid personality. The film tells the story of the author through his works: from the first to the last and incomplete ones. It is worth noting that close friends and co-authors of David, who have worked with him for many years, were invited to contribute to the film. The film used many materials: fragments of original cartoons, photographs, drawings, sketches, and newsreels of different years. Esthetically, the film is made in the spirit of Maestro Cherkassky himself, and is dedicated to his cherished memory.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/g7yuX1iHLMolhPKnkzLi4RqbHvq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161665,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studiia «Kinematohrafist»","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2020-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Star of David Cherkassky","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Star of David Cherkassky","type":"worldwide title"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Давид — свято довжиною в життя","type":"woking title"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Zirka Davyda Cherkaskoho","type":"original title transliteration"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Зірка Давида Черкаського","type":"original title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Andriienko","original_name":"Віктор Андрієнко","popularity":0.16,"profile_path":"/qqRjNpJgQrcf9VSj9kscCu2fYy9.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Host","credit_id":"604a08c290fca3006f78ea74","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3006375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serhiy Volkov","original_name":"Serhiy Volkov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604a08e26cf3d500706200cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3006375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serhiy Volkov","original_name":"Serhiy Volkov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604a08fe5f622b00446a323c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3006378,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Svitlana Stepanenko","original_name":"Svitlana Stepanenko","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604a09195f622b006daa1542","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3006375,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serhiy Volkov","original_name":"Serhiy Volkov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"604a08f3ea37e0006e83b3b8","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14216986","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"Davyd.svyato.film","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/g7yuX1iHLMolhPKnkzLi4RqbHvq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
