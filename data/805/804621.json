At the time, recruiters would often tell Black American teenagers that it was cheaper to purchase a car in Panama, or West Germany, and ship it than it would be to purchase one in the U.S. Comprised of two films, individually titled Kadett C Three and Rekord C Three, they each depict toy cars, filmed in black in white, moving from meditative takes to scenes of fast-paced movement, in which the cars nearly blur into abstraction. Accompanied by voiceovers in German, and Spanish, describing automobile performance, the work seeks to distill the complex registers of Everson’s experience, and the dangled promise of ownership into an abstract, fleeting form.","popularity":0.111,"poster_path":"/3Sx8aozuSs3OsTqqedYmqztHPRW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Opel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","original_name":"Kevin Jerome Everson","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/73HkNiQo15TBV7SysKt6ajFBbG6.jpg","credit_id":"6049c6668a0e9b002b97d156","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":973,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3Sx8aozuSs3OsTqqedYmqztHPRW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":649},{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/cIelS0G2r5F7oyZO7FaRrAy612u.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
