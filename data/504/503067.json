Led by a spiritual guide and a whip-bearing ringleader, a group of dancers ride woven horses in rhythmic unison until they are entered by spirits. Once possessed they engage in a range of self-mortification behaviors until safely emerging from their altered state, left with no memory of the event and no lingering ill effects.  The film combines footage of a number of Jathilan performances with interviews with dancers, spiritual leaders, anthropologists, and enthusiasts.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/mScBuqjfPYbchuBOHJ4QDkv9UGd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"java music, trance, ethnomusicology, anthropology, tradition and rituals","title":"Jathilan: Trance and Possession in Java","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1382913,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Lemelson","original_name":"Robert Lemelson","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a778f5c9251417760006a1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152108,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dag Yngvesson","original_name":"Dag Yngvesson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a778f9b9251417754006584","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498294,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Wing Ko","original_name":"Wing Ko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a778fc6c3a3682273006e89","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1972851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Malcolm Cross","original_name":"Malcolm Cross","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a779002925141775c0065ce","department":"Sound","job":"Music Score Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2304693","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":794,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mScBuqjfPYbchuBOHJ4QDkv9UGd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":553}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jathilan: Trance and Possession in Java Trailer","key":"exLey-tzYwM","published_at":"2012-10-11T00:41:12.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5a778edf925141776600639b"}]}}}
