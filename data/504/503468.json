One example of his tireless search and research are the Geschichten vom Kübelkind, which he co-directed with Ula Stöckl in 1969/70, 22 absurdly funny, subversive and anarchistic short films of different lengths, which consciously oppose all conventions, with incredible success. The films remain unrivalled in their Dadaistic inventiveness.","popularity":0.9445,"poster_path":"/2lHfUBx1rBxSKjOAvg8oPMsiiKE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fiction
