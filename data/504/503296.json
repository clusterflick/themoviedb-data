Warm, good humored, acutely sensitive and keenly intelligent, the protagonist is wheelchair bound and unable to speak. She has learned to communicate through an intriguing system that uses subtle eye movements and slight facial gestures. Supported by a loving Greek family, she spends her days at an educational program for adults with similar disabilities. The film explores her unique relationships with family and caregivers, her dreams of love and travel, the poetry of her eyes and words.","popularity":0.0804,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giota's Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1184014,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Garry Beitel","original_name":"Garry Beitel","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a78de1bc3a368224e017e53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2325705","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
