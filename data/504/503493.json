Ince, as Roller McCray, a steelworker turned ruthless tycoon whose tough business methods leads a rival (Philip Strange) to commit suicide. The widow (Aileen Pringle), believing she can ruin Ince by using his own methods, conspires with her husband's former partner (Sam De Grasse), but a strong friendship between Ince and Pringle's young son (Freddie Burke Frederick) changes things dramatically. According to future Three Stooges director Edward Bernds, who worked as a sound mixer on Wall Street, Ince's reaction to his rival's suicidal jump from a window ledge was changed from a sneering \"I didn't think he had the guts\" to the more respectful \"I didn't think he'd do it\" due to derisive laughter from the film's crew.","popularity":0.4571,"poster_path":"/3Y8cXVMSYQEcE8Ns8p5SOKGyEd0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wall Street","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Ince","original_name":"Ralph Ince","popularity":0.1863,"profile_path":"/73Dd6TNh5Ji2JQsj63JoxJ53sbo.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Roller McCray","credit_id":"5a7a0748c3a368226502b61b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1041608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aileen Pringle","original_name":"Aileen Pringle","popularity":0.1489,"profile_path":"/hTEtDoW8jRsM7ZXvD0fw2XhJTzp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ann Tabor","credit_id":"5a7a07580e0a26598202cfd5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Strange","original_name":"Philip Strange","popularity":0.0599,"profile_path":"/oFKVi4hAT6970FX0KcJUusOzFiW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Walter Tabor","credit_id":"5a7a07659251417757029ba0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29952,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam De Grasse","original_name":"Sam De Grasse","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":"/qiMJezjBhoygL6UDnGxF1wfqBm1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"John Willard","credit_id":"5a7a07840e0a26597f02d039","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freddie Burke Frederick","original_name":"Freddie Burke Frederick","popularity":0.1054,"profile_path":"/mPpnRIVMSCrue4YxOvt8z8J8QpN.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Richard Tabor","credit_id":"5fce52caa6725400407906a2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Hilliard","original_name":"Ernest Hilliard","popularity":0.1356,"profile_path":"/yH2Kpkp5ycD1LBzRiy1iBBVjiS2.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Savage","credit_id":"5fce52d67314a1003ecded65","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Finlayson","original_name":"James Finlayson","popularity":0.3658,"profile_path":"/mKzmqNW32JgFYICiQfEFK5m8b8s.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Andy (as Jimmy Finalyson)","credit_id":"5fce52e6e32943003c412056","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1096127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George MacFarlane","original_name":"George MacFarlane","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":"/wrLh0wFKVMAyfPoVt4fSg3AoQM2.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Ed Foster","credit_id":"5fce52f4a67254003f78e311","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Camille Rovelle","original_name":"Camille Rovelle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Miss Woods","credit_id":"5fce5301c0348b003e11a81e","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2885398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grace Wallace","original_name":"Grace Wallace","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Bonnie Tucker","credit_id":"5fce530ea5743d00400a0a30","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2885400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh McCormack","original_name":"Hugh McCormack","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Jim Tucker","credit_id":"5fce531a95c0af003fa7c960","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1045095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marshall Ruth","original_name":"Marshall Ruth","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/33ZAn0NsvwSu5V9kabcfIYF2Xmz.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Billy","credit_id":"5fce5329629b2c003ef90122","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Hall","original_name":"Ben Hall","popularity":0.1288,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Cliff","credit_id":"5fce533e6c0e4f0041bccdae","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1313002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Colvin","original_name":"William Colvin","popularity":0.114,"profile_path":"/9wqQw7DRxSRrjrKpCVX2aYvytAo.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Hoffmann (as Billy Colvin)","credit_id":"5fce534f6c0e4f003fbd08a4","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2885407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick H.
