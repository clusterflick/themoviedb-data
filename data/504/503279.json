We see aboriginal groups who incorporate traditional teachings and cultural values, raise suicide awareness through a cross-country walk, create youth programs and training the trainer workshops.  Produced by three-time winners of the American Indian Film Festival, \"A Life Worth Living\" is a powerful film that raises awareness about suicide, is hopeful, presents solutions without preaching, and generally brings this sensitive topic out into the open where it can be looked at with a clear vision.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Life Worth Living","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
