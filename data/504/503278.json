Rather than mount a traditional tour to promote a book's publication, Atwood conceived and executed something far more ambitious and revelatory--a theatrical version of her novel. Along the way she reinvented what a book tour could (and maybe should) be. But Atwood wasn't selling books as much as advocating an idea: how humanity must respond to the consequences of an environmentally compromised planet before her work of speculative fiction transforms into prophesy.","popularity":0.5103,"poster_path":"/ybhBQ3UhlD9Vh1ABvRWWhwWiiLW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109947,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sphinx Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Wake of the Flood","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","title":"En la estela de la inundaci√≥n","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":92072,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Margaret Atwood","original_name":"Margaret Atwood","popularity":0.2589,"profile_path":"/qxIYNr61CnIJBsFiu5xf3iT3bOe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Margaret Atwood","credit_id":"5a78d5219251417760018e23","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Mann","original_name":"Ron Mann","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/8kESJnrzBjqFxk7ZXM3RUvomIRC.jpg","credit_id":"5a78d50092514177570188a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":552056,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Solomon Vesta","original_name":"Solomon Vesta","popularity":0.0955,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a78d5109251417766016f8a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":552060,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robert Kennedy","original_name":"Robert Kennedy","popularity":0.1544,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c772dd49251416f381943e3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2089928,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mike Rosnick","original_name":"Mike Rosnick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c7735099251416f3e195128","department":"Sound","job":"Music Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1154210,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John M.
