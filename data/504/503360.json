It is a user driven narrative that tells a single story through the prism of two connected spaces. The film is an experiment in space and narrative using the latest in web technology.When the film was released, it was billed as the world's first interactive 3D film for the web, going on to win numerous web awards.  The story is told in a stripped down polygonal style that reflects the emotional, spiritual states of the characters. High density, smooth polygon vertices indicate oneness with the world while distorted, non-uniform shapes show unease within the characters.  The film's protagonist is Masato, a simple fisherman, spending his days fishing the waters near his village eking out a quiet, structured life. The Carp and the Seagull focuses on his encounter with the Yuki-onna ghost.","popularity":0.3778,"poster_path":"/3Uypc2vRBq1FFbECsooxH56NP0G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100644,"logo_path":null,"name":"Creators Project","origin_country":""},{"id":100643,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nexus Interactive Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Carp and the Seagull","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3579871,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Gabriel Loques","original_name":"Gabriel Loques","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629f83a3a8b2ca006608cc89","department":"Art","job":"Storyboard Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3579868,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Antoine Bourruel","original_name":"Antoine Bourruel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629f83767b7b4d00693717e0","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3579872,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Luke Ritchie","original_name":"Luke Ritchie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629f83bf53866e0051957aab","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3579870,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Michele Svaeren","original_name":"Michele Svaeren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629f838d53866e009c098826","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973600,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tim Dillon","original_name":"Tim Dillon","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a794403925141775701e106","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973597,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Plaid","original_name":"Plaid","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7942fec3a368225101d35e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1971293,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evan Boehm","original_name":"Evan Boehm","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7942ee0e0a2659880201af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Uypc2vRBq1FFbECsooxH56NP0G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":222385,"name":"interactive"},{"id":241823,"name":"web"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Carp and the Seagull (Screen Record)","key":"190987870","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2016-11-10T10:19:40.000Z","id":"629f832b53866e00519577f3"}]}}}
