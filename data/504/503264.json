Most people think that multiculturalism is a well entrenched principle in this country. Yet, at the first sign of disquiet in any part of the world, Canada's Multiculturalism policy is called into question. This hot-button issue is confronted head-on in this riveting documentary. The film records the history of various immigrant groups who are not officially recognized in history books. Can the word 'diversity' replace 'multiculturalism'? Is it just a word or a principle which determines how Canadians relate to one another?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The M Word","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428508,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lalita Krishna","original_name":"Lalita Krishna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a78cb330e0a26599401976f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2553160","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
