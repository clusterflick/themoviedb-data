They thus find themselves discussing poetry, modern times that have annulled the word, the nostalgia of “living in verse” and ask themselves if what happened in 1979 at Castelporziano will ever happen again, when authors from all over the world gathered in a great Woodstock of Poetry. Following the two poets on buses and subways, glimpses of walks and trips by car, all form an unusual description of Rome, a journey following the melancholy of the past and the uncertainty of the present, a sort of poetic tale.","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":"/m0Yg9qkqx0UxQVRGngoC0NzoW55.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poeti","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1692677,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Toni D'Angelo","original_name":"Toni D'Angelo","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a777bf99251417760005aae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1498862","wikidata_id":"Q19946714","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m0Yg9qkqx0UxQVRGngoC0NzoW55.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
