Aisha is from Pakistan and believes it’s a personal choice—she has decided to wear one. Ahlan, who has Moroccan parents, thinks it’s restrictive and does not. In the intimacy of their bedrooms, the friends do each other’s makeup, look up quotes in the Koran and work on their project. They communicate in their common language of Spanish as they discuss beliefs, values, family and cosmetics. Some Might Say does a beautiful job of substantiating the girls’ conclusion: it’s about the individual, and everyone makes their own choices.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some Might Say","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
