From Wales to Wyoming, Hong Kong to Croydon, the programme finds out how the moon shapes life on Earth, as well as exploring its mysterious dark side and discovering how the moon's journey around Earth delivers one of nature's most awe-inspiring events - a total solar eclipse. And at the end of a remarkable year of lunar activity, we find out why so many supermoons have been lighting up the night sky.","popularity":0.3519,"poster_path":"/ciJCxwdgNQDbSjwTNEo52OCz6V6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wonders of the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxine Peake","original_name":"Maxine Peake","popularity":0.766,"profile_path":"/6H2yLBIQDWgDmBkS5exDHGlZgqt.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5a842ced0e0a2653db00ae10","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1450674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Van Der Pool","original_name":"James Van Der Pool","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a842d679251410a1f00a1e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7956100","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":975,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ciJCxwdgNQDbSjwTNEo52OCz6V6.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":650},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9pNW8F0LcrGeRFDUpxcUFQp5IZj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Wonders of the Moon: Trailer - BBC One","key":"rKbyBnsp34Y","published_at":"2018-01-23T12:02:53.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"5a842e490e0a26545300ac83"}]}}}
