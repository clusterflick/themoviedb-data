After opening with disquieting archival footage of the demolition of Africville, the film shifts to an austere observational portrait. A palatable sense of the duration of midnight work slowly shifts into subtle gestures that hint towards choreographed events. Eventually, a breech occurs as the protagonist fuses with an emergent dreamscape, where ruined landscapes and a resurrection of an extinct community intertwine. Using the protagonist's disembodied point-of-view, the audience floats above a reconstructed Africville, one forever present, nesting in a bed of saltwater fog.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/bYtK2igBPs9OKORawdguVNOfQ2h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Salt Water Elegy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2689430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacinte Armstrong","original_name":"Jacinte Armstrong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef29f546beaea00365212f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cory Bowles","original_name":"Cory Bowles","popularity":0.168,"profile_path":"/lY5hSQK41aMNyivZVcKiSd87zYo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5ef29f66967cc7003545a237","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2672555,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Solomon Nagler","original_name":"Solomon Nagler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ef29f4c2b210800338fe5a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2208364","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":934,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bYtK2igBPs9OKORawdguVNOfQ2h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":623}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Black Salt Water Elegy (Full Film)","key":"75991383","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2013-10-02T19:03:55.000Z","id":"5ef2a5be2b210800349016f6"}]}}}
