Made on a Paillard Bolex by a group calling itself the ‘Joris Ivens collective’, it was one of the first Indian documentaries to face censorship under the Emergency. Much of the footage reflects Ghose’s preoccupation, later developed in his features, with people surviving on the margins of society.","popularity":0.0654,"poster_path":"/uKbCU6C3tVWS4p1lZhA5tVCHitF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hungry Autumn","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Goutam Ghose","original_name":"Goutam Ghose","popularity":0.1789,"profile_path":"/fhWVf0QMFnuInxCD0VPl2HibTny.jpg","credit_id":"5a7855d60e0a26598e012438","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uKbCU6C3tVWS4p1lZhA5tVCHitF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
