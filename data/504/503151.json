Were it possible to freeze into a solid the sum of all the images, the screen would be seen as a limitless freezer of frames. Even more so, when the screen is a screen of a screenâ€”a condition approaching the simultaneity of electronics. The usual battery of devices: Super-8, 16mm and slide projectors. A constructed series of film loops with scenes of [everyday] life, slowing down and accelerating the events on a solitary screen, so that life as it has been staged gathers itself up in a perpetual serial [process of] self-editing. On the tv screen a face is pierced through by the small filmic screen.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/j0ASMpIIiU3uSZfmEfLipsrchfe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Screen, Just the Screen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paolo Gioli","original_name":"Paolo Gioli","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/mA2Q0SwP0Wk56hRNNCQDeKNSFdE.jpg","credit_id":"5a78448a0e0a26598b01176c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q122692098","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j0ASMpIIiU3uSZfmEfLipsrchfe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
