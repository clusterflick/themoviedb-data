Being queer, the “sweet sixteen” character has only two girlfriends to invite to her party: one is the daughter of Jehovah’s Witnesses, the other a precocious slut. The party is depicted primarily in long shots in a 1960s home-movie style. The mother is a hippie (played by a drag queen) who believes in free love, communal living and crazy parties. She has her boyfriend serve cake to the girls and brings in a male dancer and a female sex worker to entertain them.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wJoOjC7mN0eBJgMh6kHqWRG8r2j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Birthday Party","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1974343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jill Reiter","original_name":"Jill Reiter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a7b78959251414b15002383","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":949,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wJoOjC7mN0eBJgMh6kHqWRG8r2j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":712}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
