When he was a kid.’ · ‘A monster?’ · ‘Yeah, a monster. It moves between this world and the next.’  Ao lives with his mother and little sister Kii on Sado Island in Japan. He misses his father, who recently disappeared without a trace – although not much is spoken about it. While their mother tries to deal with the loss in her own way, Ao and Kii run across the island and scream at the ocean. In the mysterious Sayoko, who inconspicuously swipes books from the school library, Ao finds a confidant. Few words are needed between the two reticent, dreamy children: together, they at once feel less alone. Against the striking backdrop of an industrialised coastal town, Tetsuya Tomina's poetic film tells a tale of dreams, loss and monsters.","popularity":0.5617,"poster_path":"/yzOJ7YYkVS2aEu8LQEv0wlXDSZp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2018-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Wind Blows","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"블루 윈드 블로우스","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ブルー・ウインド・ブローズ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2078006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hizuki Tanaka","original_name":"Hizuki Tanaka","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Ao","credit_id":"5b3cd60092514102d300918e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":123740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yayako Uchida","original_name":"内田也哉子","popularity":0.1819,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Midori","credit_id":"5b3cd5ea92514102b0009a78","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2078007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tsubaki Tanaka","original_name":"Tsubaki Tanaka","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Kii","credit_id":"5b3cd6160e0a2623f800a10e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masato Hagiwara","original_name":"萩原聖人","popularity":0.5039,"profile_path":"/iS8eHxcb6R2eL84XcBGJagQCNRj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Asano","credit_id":"5b3cd62d0e0a262417009393","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaiji Moriyama","original_name":"森山開次","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Kimura","credit_id":"5b3cd800c3a368596400a6c3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2138801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ninon","original_name":"新音","popularity":0.2165,"profile_path":"/65SrZw7BeQQjpToNOkLyVouJnq9.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5bb14e850e0a263398007a09","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1252998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuuya Uchida","original_name":"内田夕夜","popularity":0.482,"profile_path":"/4xLLQGEDWtmLWUapo0UnfvCdsXp.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Michio Mukoda","credit_id":"5e265864ed2ac2001038b6c2","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tetsuya Tomina","original_name":"Tetsuya Tomina","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a79ee729251417757027c2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tetsuya Tomina","original_name":"Tetsuya Tomina","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3cd8c9c3a368594500950e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1720227,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hitoshi Tsurumaki","original_name":"鶴巻仁","popularity":0.0959,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3cd5a5c3a368594800929f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2078009,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Susumu Miyazu","original_name":"Susumu Miyazu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3cd8e50e0a26241d009b64","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1973739,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tetsuya Tomina","original_name":"Tetsuya Tomina","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5b3cd8d592514102da0099ae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7953568","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yzOJ7YYkVS2aEu8LQEv0wlXDSZp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jogja-NETPAC Asian Film Festival","release_date":"2019-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
