Dagmar Schellenberger compellingly conveys Blanche's journey from distress to acceptance… Anja Silja's portrayal of the old Prioress is outstanding, with its disturbing transformation from serene wisdom to terrified, blasphemous, near-madness as death approaches. ...Riccardo Muti and the La Scala orchestra in magnificent form, captured in magnificent sound. Ultimately, it is the final scene, with its multiple executions, that makes or breaks a production of Dialogues. Carsen's allegorical solution is both elegant and deeply moving.” BBC Music Magazine, September 2007","popularity":0.155,"poster_path":"/j0O4kgNiRLGHy32QXHpwkklxhVv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2004-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":149,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dialogues des Carmelites","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1974699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Robertson","original_name":"Christopher Robertson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Marquis de la Force","credit_id":"5a7ca213c3a3680f86017931","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1115340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dagmar Schellenberger","original_name":"Dagmar Schellenberger","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/91C3ZJ17Uzfs85fAc1yMe20wxaY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Blanche de la Force","credit_id":"5a7ca21ac3a3680f7f015ac6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1974700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Gietz","original_name":"Gordon Gietz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Chevalier de la Force","credit_id":"5a7ca235c3a3680f9c015bb4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1385107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anja Silja","original_name":"Anja Silja","popularity":0.0657,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Madame de Croissy","credit_id":"5a7ca2509251414b1f014fa1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1974701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gwynne Geyer","original_name":"Gwynne Geyer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Madame Lidoine","credit_id":"5a7ca27bc3a3680fad0138ef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1683251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Dever","original_name":"Barbara Dever","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Mere Marie de l' incarnation","credit_id":"5a7ca29d9251414b1c014eab","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1654530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Aikin","original_name":"Laura Aikin","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/62JXMsWISMD9YYbEglEn3lPGhDU.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Soeur Constance","credit_id":"5a7ca2bbc3a3680f9401536c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1568221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annamaria Popescu","original_name":"Annamaria Popescu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mere Jeanne","credit_id":"5a7ca2dcc3a3680f940153a3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1565306,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Allegretta","original_name":"Sara Allegretta","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Soeur Mathilde","credit_id":"5a7ca2f09251414b22015791","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1512462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Carsen","original_name":"Robert Carsen","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/ffsRQfAAVpOPuzHChuZjEbBcefJ.jpg","credit_id":"5a7ca3349251414b18015e2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":149342,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Riccardo Muti","original_name":"Riccardo Muti","popularity":0.1337,"profile_path":"/2vUosOkdjyE4IsmXXOYYifMQZdE.jpg","credit_id":"5a7ca34ac3a3680f86017b5c","department":"Sound","job":"Music Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4zdKVwseLZd0SAzjXEkg0hHWSWM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fPXhmXNIFvADDJBnVWOJaQii8p1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":788,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j0O4kgNiRLGHy32QXHpwkklxhVv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1520,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jJbH79sG5RVVwW3kqFEf19LwVU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1013}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Live performance in La Scala","release_date":"2004-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
