Just under 3000 metres in altitude, excavators dig into the ground using dynamite to build a reservoir for the preparation of artificial snow. Concrete blocks of apartments are springing up everywhere, while elsewhere in the mountains, young people have long since moved away and old people talk about how their hometown no longer has a future. Too many regions in the Alps have become dependent on hopelessly commercialized skiing. In PEAK, Hannes Lang observes the invasion and hostile takeover of the Alps by ski tourism and introduces us to the people affected: winners and losers, enthusiasts, sceptics and lost souls.","popularity":0.1661,"poster_path":"/e4RI6HAjh0WADnWIVZV9HZSVd1d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140562,"logo_path":null,"name":"unafilm","origin_country":""},{"id":69646,"logo_path":"/abY1pN2KktLLp0R0XVm7sRdicWj.png","name":"Movimento Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2011-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peak - Über allen Gipfeln","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannes Lang","original_name":"Hannes Lang","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d77c3a36847f8262737","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannes Lang","original_name":"Hannes Lang","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e6a48fd2f3b1700194047ee","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1091955,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mareike Wegener","original_name":"Mareike Wegener","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e6a490755c9260015663e8a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2054801","wikidata_id":"Q15867527","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/n1YXvpWoOKXQEdHp77WMT5Jr8B8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":2580,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/e4RI6HAjh0WADnWIVZV9HZSVd1d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1802}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
