The Namibian police rule out an accident and the victim's wife and business partner Maja Reichardt is suspected to be involved in the death of her husband. She has only two hours to convince the German embassy staff of her innocence. If she fails she will be transferred to the local judiciary facing months of pretrial detention. Unfortunately diplomatic officer Kirsten Buresch who has to take the final decision feels that Maja is suffering from paranoia and therefore might have had a reason to kill her husband.","popularity":0.174,"poster_path":"/bE3TCW28y1S59IfRp9CAfCkDCDB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Verdacht","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1859,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christiane Paul","original_name":"Christiane Paul","popularity":0.3019,"profile_path":"/h1Cr9GA5C29FhDzbRZ6qrLTydjB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Maja Reichardt","credit_id":"52fe4d6cc3a36847f8260227","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans-Jochen Wagner","original_name":"Hans-Jochen Wagner","popularity":0.2991,"profile_path":"/8Rb0EeRXhqzpY5E6XyC5fcHQyQn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hanno Reichardt","credit_id":"52fe4d6cc3a36847f826022b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34644,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ina Weisse","original_name":"Ina Weisse","popularity":0.2684,"profile_path":"/nfBCzdd6nukTClhyLAMZYl6xD2w.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kirsten Buresch","credit_id":"52fe4d6cc3a36847f826022f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Besson","original_name":"Pierre Besson","popularity":0.2231,"profile_path":"/v2YP5vb6LAn72udlN4pP6x6bs0.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Achim Borchert","credit_id":"53fddc13c3a3684c77001021","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37538,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matti Geschonneck","original_name":"Matti Geschonneck","popularity":0.1158,"profile_path":"/v1D0gNnMXJYOU3NLrMxqc4BqBvT.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d6cc3a36847f8260235","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7149,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bernd Lange","original_name":"Bernd Lange","popularity":0.1986,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d6cc3a36847f826023b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1806876","wikidata_id":"Q1197801","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/bE3TCW28y1S59IfRp9CAfCkDCDB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
