In Heaven? Or in Hell? On Earth, the Angel and the Devil come across with the story of a father, Parvo, who blames his daughter's death on Onzeneiro. While Parvo looks to get his revenge on Onzeneiro, this one tries to get rid of the murder charges by paying of the judge. They both gather with their accomplices at the same place, a brothel, without knowing about each other's presence. Here alliances are formed and broken with the help of peculiar friendships, represented by the characters of \"Auto da Barca do Inferno\".","popularity":0.1201,"poster_path":"/AcMP9usBxEGQEpZDKOQ2hfN4jNM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2009-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Quando o Anjo e o Diabo Colaboram","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1159172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Celas","original_name":"Sandra Celas","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/vybxPJYxitm5hQcznAbslSI877t.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Anjo","credit_id":"52fe4d79c3a36847f8262efb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1159173,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernando Ferrão","original_name":"Fernando Ferrão","popularity":0.0828,"profile_path":"/uS61UxHVSWjQWtj69OBAs6QNv6d.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Judeu","credit_id":"52fe4d79c3a36847f8262eff","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":621011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Gago","original_name":"André Gago","popularity":0.1642,"profile_path":"/dvRWQ8QaCSLTa7OT7G4LdVgZnFY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Procurador","credit_id":"52fe4d79c3a36847f8262f03","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1159174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luís Magalhães","original_name":"Luís Magalhães","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Enforcado","credit_id":"52fe4d79c3a36847f8262f07","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":139032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Padrão","original_name":"Ana Padrão","popularity":0.2776,"profile_path":"/95pA5Iy9FlVSQNFaGrh74l7Tf8q.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Alcoviteira","credit_id":"52fe4d79c3a36847f8262f0b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":213291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Filipe Vargas","original_name":"Filipe Vargas","popularity":0.1348,"profile_path":"/abKebqQaHjsOv7JPavRDUUyNmXr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Cavaleiro","credit_id":"52fe4d79c3a36847f8262f13","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduardo Viana","original_name":"Eduardo Viana","popularity":0.0599,"profile_path":"/coDsBffbI1KwdXi4i8DSXFH42GB.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Onzeneiro","credit_id":"52fe4d79c3a36847f8262f17","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142768,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"João Villas-Boas","original_name":"João Villas-Boas","popularity":0.1461,"profile_path":"/zXiuO72IdrUZ1zTAszyzunD0mUq.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Parvo","credit_id":"52fe4d79c3a36847f8262f1b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2360214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rui Santos","original_name":"Rui Santos","popularity":0.0654,"profile_path":"/gvprHwyTOdqIrieaydTDhyekM4z.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Diabo","credit_id":"5ec742e8e635710022ceb63a","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1159175,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paula Soares","original_name":"Paula Soares","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d79c3a36847f8262f21","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1159175,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paula Soares","original_name":"Paula Soares","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d79c3a36847f8262f27","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1159176,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cátia Rodrigues","original_name":"Cátia Rodrigues","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d79c3a36847f8262f2d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1159177,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sara Oliveira","original_name":"Sara Oliveira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d79c3a36847f8262f33","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1159178,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Inês Sirgado","original_name":"Inês Sirgado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d79c3a36847f8262f39","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AcMP9usBxEGQEpZDKOQ2hfN4jNM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":679}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
