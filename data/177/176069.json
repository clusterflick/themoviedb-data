Set in the pre-email era of the 1980s, young Ellie, newly arrived to the US from Israel, anxiously waits for letters from her best friend back home. Suffering from homesickness, language difficulties and rejection at school, life brightens when she meets Thuy, a Vietnamese refugee her age. As the two bond and become inseparable, they eventually hurt each other, and Ellie must find a way to restore their trust. Based on director Ela Thier's personal immigration experience, Foreign Letters is a film about poverty, prejudice, shame, and the healing power of friendship.","popularity":0.1208,"poster_path":"/yCQ5DC6fwTlwzhEmrU6MNTZ5mu5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13547,"logo_path":"/w7UA7vebRzkLiAo09yk1n0A40SH.png","name":"NBTV Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13548,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thier Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A story of friendships without borders","title":"Foreign Letters","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158424,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noa Rotstein","original_name":"Noa Rotstein","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ellie","credit_id":"52fe4d69c3a36847f825f97d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dalena Le","original_name":"Dalena Le","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Thuy","credit_id":"52fe4d69c3a36847f825f975","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":585990,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ela Thier","original_name":"Ela Thier","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Ellie's mother","credit_id":"52fe4d69c3a36847f825f985","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Udi Razzin","original_name":"Udi Razzin","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Ellie's Dad","credit_id":"5f9982f29a9f9a00357de02e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1158425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daphna Thier","original_name":"Daphna Thier","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/aVoXfMytDDHyvU4gMBccMmBCX4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Dalia","credit_id":"52fe4d69c3a36847f825f981","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Camien","original_name":"Laura Camien","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Mrs. Carol","credit_id":"52fe4d69c3a36847f825f96d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2833763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uri Thier","original_name":"Uri Thier","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Ellie's Grandfather","credit_id":"5f9983325a07f5003a32a8c1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158421,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Virginia Hastings","original_name":"Virginia Hastings","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"ESL Teacher","credit_id":"5f99835ea1c59d0037a48966","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":585990,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ela Thier","original_name":"Ela Thier","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d69c3a36847f825f98f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":585990,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ela Thier","original_name":"Ela Thier","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d69c3a36847f825f995","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1492841","wikidata_id":"Q17004468","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":988,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uLhWaA9oiDghCvMxNdPW6d0KmUL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1757}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yCQ5DC6fwTlwzhEmrU6MNTZ5mu5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Foreign Letters - OFFICIAL Trailer","key":"m2H0cgrpyrU","published_at":"2012-08-17T23:19:47.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"533ec705c3a368544800a334"}]}}}
