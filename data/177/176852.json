But the real breakthrough is slow in coming.  Jeanette especially desperately needs a big success, since her friend, the journalist Stephan, is about to lose his job.  When the two have their chance to take a ride in a posh car during a shooting, Jeanette slams on the throttle and the two friends take off.  Their aimless journey takes them to a fashionable winter sports’ hotel, where Jeanette reserves a name under “The Countess of Monte Christo”.  Everything’s going dandy; no one suspects a thing.  That is, until two impostors, Rumowski and “The Baron” take residence in the same hotel.","popularity":0.3664,"poster_path":"/mx4TgRPbG69U4Gy2TE0vDPcf489.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12372,"logo_path":"/lcQScIQXHQXuLMLFQt0loJl5gWJ.png","name":"UFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1932-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
