The characters around the bar Strudsen (the ostrich) are doing what ostriches do, hiding themselves from the threats of life and keeping their dreams to themselves. Scriptwriter Benny Andersen being a poet is rendering a loving portrait of a number of persons, who fail to try to make their dreams come true, possibly not being sufficiently dissatisfied with their life after all. The manager would like a bar of his own but dare not admit to it, the butcher would like to be an opera singer, the window cleaner (sorry, window polisher) is secretly in love with the bar lady, but dare not show it and the pianist willingly listens to all the different dreams being presented to him. This film was the best accomplished movie from Henning Carlsen since his debut with 'Sult'.","popularity":0.4676,"poster_path":"/3fbDgyOFQxPC0aIakXPX8ayhsHK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108164,"logo_path":null,"name":"Henning Carlsen Film","origin_country":""},{"id":235,"logo_path":"/obOynoztBEhDNfHsDXBqOuQLAZk.png","name":"Nordisk Film Denmark","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1972-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh, to Be on the Bandwagon!","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Balladen om den glada krogen","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Man Sku Vaere Noget Ved Musikken","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","title":"Man skulle være noe med musikken","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl Stegger","original_name":"Karl Stegger","popularity":0.1806,"profile_path":"/yIBcWpxsPoX9xugAA4hCmXn92Cq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Søren","credit_id":"52fe4d74c3a36847f8261df1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":579142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Birgitte Price","original_name":"Birgitte Price","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":"/5oqwae2a7McY97dAKwuISCvACys.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Sven","credit_id":"52fe4d74c3a36847f8261df9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Brandenburg","original_name":"Otto Brandenburg","popularity":0.2279,"profile_path":"/f6BPJPWIDV5oau4NPRc9Co7BgOg.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lasse","credit_id":"52fe4d74c3a36847f8261e01","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":209396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesper Langberg","original_name":"Jesper Langberg","popularity":0.2216,"profile_path":"/qFljRHKIcQeikKliaZWxmI7ly1K.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Svend","credit_id":"59864e179251413d2b0078d5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":246194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingolf David","original_name":"Ingolf David","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/kjurYelDoXFozgVoOmJFeKLAc49.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Ib","credit_id":"59864e28c3a3683251007504","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lone Lindorff","original_name":"Lone Lindorff","popularity":0.1415,"profile_path":"/5xQiw4JvujTZCD2y2jcz87h2dL7.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff1a34a1fb94f0041f5a51f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gyrd Løfquist","original_name":"Gyrd Løfqvist","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/jSCJRtmzlGe6ztTAxYDhe69yVFo.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff1a357ca7ec60040b053ce","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1169334,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lene Maimu","original_name":"Lene Maimu","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":"/5SppJO4AlErKC5JROpqNe7INzvq.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff1a361df2945003e2b63cf","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1045280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lene Vasegaard","original_name":"Lene Vasegaard","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":"/7fLZZWGAHq4AhGFx8D6DDGT0pwK.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff1a36cd2f5b5003e2ce251","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":936786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Margrethe Stein","original_name":"Ellen Margrethe Stein","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":"/ltHkuRCDBAxdP36CBlt9IFbML2O.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff1a378156cc7003def83e2","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1045281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Birgit Conradi","original_name":"Birgit Conradi","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5E4CnyvaTzClPlA95wk6W9l6U0o.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"","credit_id":"5ff1a3849affc0003ef52566","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans W.
