A young Japanese boy in the devastated city of Nagasaki, two months after the atomic bomb, carries on his back the lifeless body of his younger brother. An American military photographer, Joe O'Donnell, took a picture of the boy standing stoically near a cremation pit. No one knows the subject's name, but the photo has become an iconic image of the human tragedy of nuclear war. This documentary follows the continuing efforts to deepen understanding of the photograph, while exploring the fate of thousands of atomic-bomb orphans and their struggles to survive the aftermath of World War II.","popularity":0.1224,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":194092,"logo_path":"/dnoNljXZQkHQubzaqME1mFRRBgJ.png","name":"NHK WORLD-JAPAN","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2020-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Searching for the Standing Boy of Nagasaki","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Standing Boy of Nagasaki","type":"Shortened title in some cable listings"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":233,"name":"japan"},{"id":1815,"name":"atomic bomb"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":9736,"name":"little boy"},{"id":13094,"name":"photograph"},{"id":173989,"name":"old photograph"},{"id":194405,"name":"nuclear warfare"},{"id":207883,"name":"1940s"},{"id":208304,"name":"cremation"},{"id":215235,"name":"dead brother"},{"id":244247,"name":"nagasaki"},{"id":267475,"name":"war orphan"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"NHK World premiere","release_date":"2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
