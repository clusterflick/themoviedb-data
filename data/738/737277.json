Using the audio-visual approaches of essay film, first-person cinema vérité, staged actions, and decades of home movies, Madsen navigates a town steeped in opioid addiction, economic depression, and religious fervor, while using the act of filmmaking to rebuild familial bonds and reimagine justice. Posing empathy as a tool for creating a more just world, North By Current does not seek to investigate a crime, but creates a relentless portrait of an enduring pastoral family, poised to reframe and reimagine narratives about incarceration, addiction, trans embodiment, and ruralness.","popularity":0.471,"poster_path":"/bpzKID7OoN7Yc3X3UelkPtrVGiO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71551,"logo_path":"/hT2G2iuXXqY458TYen2T2qmjlS8.png","name":"Field of Vision","origin_country":"US"},{"id":113790,"logo_path":"/g7FpsadP1UG9MotNi54RvE5hiGY.png","name":"JustFilms / Ford Foundation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":110842,"logo_path":"/dzFVNsYm8hihgjv9tZrQRPIn9Mf.png","name":"Tribeca Film Institute","origin_country":"US"},{"id":93092,"logo_path":"/unMAQEA4tPsOndGkPSsoVq9HKTu.png","name":"Sundance Institute","origin_country":"US"},{"id":20590,"logo_path":"/pco0XApCHktibWvUG2IpGj4DBV9.png","name":"American Documentary","origin_country":"US"},{"id":140069,"logo_path":"/blYX6Tr7cIvdpYdbzEb7P6OHPOA.png","name":"Open Society Foundations","origin_country":"US"},{"id":152857,"logo_path":null,"name":"Catapult Film Fund","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"North by Current","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1421428,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelo Madsen Minax","original_name":"Angelo Madsen Minax","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/tFAiRLVpd1QczWn2UMXcJPpzYUW.jpg","credit_id":"5f4822a53c3ab000356aac5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2344350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Baker","original_name":"Julien Baker","popularity":0.1228,"profile_path":"/rZmBSBd2IHfhXPySeei23qiLVF5.jpg","credit_id":"5f482367ea394900363d1e93","department":"Sound","job":"Music Arranger"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10196480","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5hpFUH4eZMcOex7YVU51COr8tDL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3VFo8fLiuMSqAIgmT94R2vOlqda.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/FSvFGfYDKm2I35X1xfshBSPbaa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bpzKID7OoN7Yc3X3UelkPtrVGiO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1175},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ymEiCuHVo28KGT3UEWsqQg38xZG.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1803,"name":"drug addiction"},{"id":6782,"name":"addiction"},{"id":11004,"name":"rural area"},{"id":229800,"name":"incarceration"},{"id":255834,"name":"rural life"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Melbourne International Film Festival","release_date":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"18","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Prime Video","release_date":"2022-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sicilia Queer","release_date":"2021-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"North By Current | Official Trailer | Berlinale 2021","key":"hZHbDRBj6BE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-02-26T16:58:01.000Z","id":"618b055f5346610044706a6a"}]}}}
