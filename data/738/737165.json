As each woman reflects on the biases and sexism that she faced at the beginning of her career, the stories seem to echo one another. Directed by Academy® Award-winner Rayka Zehtabchi, we witness glimpses of their dark pasts intertwined with the brightest moments of their careers. Each woman carved out a place for herself in the industry — not just as a woman, but as a butcher, chef and restaurateur.","popularity":0.0855,"poster_path":"/4eXCiXdHNLMloWu4N9WVvIQyncW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Butcher, The Chef, and The Restaurateur","title":"A Woman's Place","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3131472,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Natasha Wellesley","original_name":"Natasha Wellesley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623f3125c50ad2005ccb8725","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2438760,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nick Boak","original_name":"Nick Boak","popularity":0.0777,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623f3135eb64f1005c0ee8c5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2244026,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giosuè Greco","original_name":"Giosuè Greco","popularity":0.0555,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623f314245765d0047d0703c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1918673,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Daniel Bruson","original_name":"Daniel Bruson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623f314b417aaf00871e77c2","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2042771,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sam Davis","original_name":"Sam Davis","popularity":0.0937,"profile_path":"/2UEAwTIb0AMYvpFoEuI0FXTMpdL.jpg","credit_id":"623f3167c616ac0047791418","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2042770,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rayka Zehtabchi","original_name":"Rayka Zehtabchi","popularity":0.2073,"profile_path":"/igMEKnKIEd0K2yKo2u9kELq8I9r.jpg","credit_id":"5f47ca678cfcc70034474656","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12987716","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":988,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4eXCiXdHNLMloWu4N9WVvIQyncW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":658}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
