During the seventies ELP were the biggest band in the world playing to colossal crowds and mounting ever more spectacular and flamboyant stage shows. When the band split in 1978 the legacy disappeared almost overnight. Featuring rare archive footage, every ELP studio album is reviewed and critically assessed by a leading team of critics, working musicians and musicologists to explore the secrets behind the phenomenal rise to success and the equally spectacular fall from grace of this legendary band.","popularity":0.0718,"poster_path":"/verDvMxekpyNKdIserMa4aldCSr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":186475,"logo_path":null,"name":"Classic Rock Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside Emerson, Lake & Palmer 1970-1995","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Emerson, Lake & Palmer Inside","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548768,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Keith Emerson","original_name":"Keith Emerson","popularity":0.3919,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64bd47340ed2ab00c5e39a74","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":548769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Lake","original_name":"Greg Lake","popularity":0.1359,"profile_path":"/jcLKYPrXsfRtPRvPPEkrV0y3hU2.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64bd4745b865eb00ada0b4ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146235,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Palmer","original_name":"Carl Palmer","popularity":0.092,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64bd4759ad50f000e4c764aa","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229579,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bob Carruthers","original_name":"Bob Carruthers","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/vWqpErkseOgbYYiKoc0VvmEvHDX.jpg","credit_id":"64c8fe9f89f74900c981d9a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229579,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bob Carruthers","original_name":"Bob Carruthers","popularity":0.1612,"profile_path":"/vWqpErkseOgbYYiKoc0VvmEvHDX.jpg","credit_id":"64c8feaff794ad011cb09b04","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438960,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kirk Britten","original_name":"Kirk Britten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64c8fec408cf8700e277adc6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/verDvMxekpyNKdIserMa4aldCSr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
