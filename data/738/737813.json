Janet, who is the author of children's adventure stories, longs for the company of children, and one day is surprised to see a little girl playing in her garden. The child is hungry and inadequately clothed, and Janet takes her into the house, determined to keep her. The next day the police enquire throughout the neighbourhood and call at Janet's house. She conceals the fact that she is hiding the child. Later, the local parson calls and tells Janet that Mrs. Star, a widow and the mother of the missing Sally, is not only heart-nroken but a very sick woman.","popularity":0.8037,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":43707,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monarch Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1954-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Child","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":132099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Portland Mason","original_name":"Portland Mason","popularity":0.2271,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Sally","credit_id":"5f4abcea74507d0032abb336","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Mason","original_name":"Pamela Mason","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":"/swqkw5EJH5XXEYdodllCXxMaWmQ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Janet","credit_id":"5f4abcf553f8330035bd2ed4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30501,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean McClory","original_name":"Sean McClory","popularity":0.5386,"profile_path":"/3DtG026ynOwsH9nhqwqskCrM2Bg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Reverend Smith","credit_id":"5f4abd0c1684f700366dfe19","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1306409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Osborne","original_name":"Judy Osborne","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Mrs. Starr","credit_id":"5f4abd2064de350036a90939","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1226783,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Roy Kellino","original_name":"Roy Kellino","popularity":0.1116,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4abd4e0929f6003456464f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2759760,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Inigo Jones","original_name":"Inigo Jones","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4abd6064de350036a909a0","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Mason","original_name":"James Mason","popularity":1.0341,"profile_path":"/ivmJl4jLgYoxI93EPgBehund505.jpg","credit_id":"5f4abd3a12aabc0034a3015d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0046852","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1954-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
