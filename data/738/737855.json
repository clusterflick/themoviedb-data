Set in a theatre over the course of an evening, Julia finds herself as a last-minute replacement for another actress at the dress rehearsal of a stage play version of The Turn of the Screw, set in 1890.  Arriving at the theatre late that night, Julia is immediately thrown on stage and into her role, playing to an empty auditorium. As she interacts with the other characters and the story becomes increasingly terrifying, Julia begins to believe that not only is the fictitious house hauntedâ€¦ but also the theatre itself!","popularity":0.2606,"poster_path":"/jsNYGhnwFajcMjDUYQ4NhY8QnOZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5142,"logo_path":null,"name":"Galvinized
