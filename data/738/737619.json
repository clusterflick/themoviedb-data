Artist and professor Willie Baronet has purchased more than 1,300 homeless signs over the past 24 years, and he uses this collection to create installations to raise awareness about homelessness. During the month of July, 2014, Willie and three filmmakers drove across the country, interviewing more than 100 people on the streets and purchasing over 280 signs. Signs of Humanity is a film about that trip.","popularity":0.0478,"poster_path":"/rPXordUy8wbS9B1nJvCuoITleQf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Signs of Humanity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2758750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willie Baronet","original_name":"Willie Baronet","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f49aeb204b5960037b4d484","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2580856,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eamon Downey","original_name":"Eamon Downey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f49af26ce6c4c00349f762b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2758751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Chumley","original_name":"Tim Chumley","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f49aefefe5c91003629f620","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2758750,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willie Baronet","original_name":"Willie Baronet","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f49aeccd399e60033c8a1bc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2758751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Chumley","original_name":"Tim Chumley","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f49aeee23be460033fca785","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2758751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Chumley","original_name":"Tim Chumley","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f49aedd37b3a90035dfbfa7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2758752,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Judy Burch Gass","original_name":"Judy Burch Gass","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f49af13d399e60035c8ec65","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5609524","wikidata_id":"Q26913379","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rPXordUy8wbS9B1nJvCuoITleQf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":508}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"Dallas International Film Festival","release_date":"2016-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
