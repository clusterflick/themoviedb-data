The mystic-folkie ethos that has long been her caricature are well showcased via the cult fave Rumours outtake/B-side \"Silver Spring,\" the muscular Sheryl Crow collaboration \"Sorcerer,\" and a live version of the moody \"Rhiannon\" that casts it in even longer shadows. Yet Stevie Nicks has always displayed a willingness to push herself beyond her hippie muse, as witnessed by the dense aura of Deep Dish's remix of Mac's \"Dreams\" and such disparate, pop-savvy solo highlights as \"I Can't Wait,\" \"Stand Back,\" and shrewd, successful duets with Tom Petty (\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\") and Don Henley (\"Leather and Lace\").","popularity":0.8358,"poster_path":"/AlYYTttKjPBuJzy0uhCNDzXGuc8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crystal Visions: The Very Best of Stevie Nicks","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stevie Nicks","original_name":"Stevie Nicks","popularity":0.3097,"profile_path":"/n8gLNEXq7GNO4gH4MDsvYOlwuLE.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6230250ccc96830046cffa22","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Petty","original_name":"Tom Petty","popularity":0.4062,"profile_path":"/iYZ34EdhyaVbGyBagXyQ2v1YLrG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62302513cba36f00458befb1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheryl Crow","original_name":"Sheryl Crow","popularity":0.437,"profile_path":"/qS0VRNBZYqIxP56y4JbKzi4r2vm.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6230251cd48cee0045e1a837","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":340,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jimmy Iovine","original_name":"Jimmy Iovine","popularity":0.1956,"profile_path":"/23Hdo1bK5LsGwfAB3NMjwsiqXe5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"623025240328b9001998344d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Campbell","original_name":"Mike Campbell","popularity":0.1602,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62302531c3aa3f004575a3c5","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AlYYTttKjPBuJzy0uhCNDzXGuc8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/25gVsX2l6A4d5iYohDtoBwPIrY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
