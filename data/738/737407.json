In her mountain hut in Ciaminades, in Val Badia, Roberta Dapunt talks to us about her writing. She lets us glimpse the sheets of poetry hanging on the wall, waiting for additions and deletions, subject to continuous rewriting. And when Roberta reads her poetry we cling to the verse as if to a mountain rock face.","popularity":0.0858,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scrivo ad alta voce","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2757887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberta Dapunt","original_name":"Roberta Dapunt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f48c3c2efca000035c396b1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2485153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pier Paolo Giarolo","original_name":"Pier Paolo Giarolo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f48c3d3bd101e003755d408","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2757888,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Dalla Palma","original_name":"Antonio Dalla Palma","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f48c3eea2e6020035f60e92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2757889,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marcello Fera","original_name":"Marcello Fera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f48c40245819900313aef42","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2485153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pier Paolo Giarolo","original_name":"Pier Paolo Giarolo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f48c416813cb60034902e1b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2485153,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pier Paolo Giarolo","original_name":"Pier Paolo Giarolo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f48c4271bf2660037d59dcb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":496,"name":"poetry"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"it\", \"native_name\"=>\"Italian\"}","note":"Trento Film Festival World Premiere","release_date":"2020-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
