During that period I still had the great privilege to be shooting Kodachrome. My method for editing was to first select the footage I wanted to use from the original camera rolls and then make an internegative and work print of that selected material to work with in the editing. (In an earlier period, I did not have to first make an internegative, but could more simply make a work print directly off the camera original, but Kodak cancelled the reversal work print film stock.)","popularity":0.0614,"poster_path":"/oiTLMCPRVXLM8mnceLkZZ73YEfK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kodachrome Dailies from the Time of Song and Solitude (Reel 2)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1071582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathaniel Dorsky","original_name":"Nathaniel Dorsky","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/dhJc7fXL8eQovtm6wMQb9cQZY7j.jpg","credit_id":"5f474fa38cfcc70036472b9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oiTLMCPRVXLM8mnceLkZZ73YEfK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
