On the seat beside him is a framed photograph of an unknown woman. Behind him is a 2CV into which is squeezed Five Bald Men. Why are they chasing him? And how can he shake them off? As he travels North through France, he encounters razeteurs, women with stories to tell, bullfights, plenty of delicious food, a damp man, mechanics, nuns, a convention of Chrystallographers and much more, coming face to face with the vivid eccentricities of an old country.","popularity":1.4026,"poster_path":"/hYLhSAbVW1Wa9mRX05DGCL5X20w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Open Palm
