Since childhood, his daughter Alessia, the director, often saw him looking out the window, wondering what was able to attract his attention in such an intense way. Several years later, during a return trip to Naples, her father's hometown, Alessia finds herself observing her father again. Also this time Giuseppe is always in profile and, while the landscape flows framed in the window of a train, his gaze tries to capture every moment, to stop those moments and save them from the fast passage of time.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/xxj6rGCWsIqH8bBvWHpEOPSuVTW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Napoli di mio padre","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1435167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Bellè","original_name":"Valentina Bellè","popularity":0.4641,"profile_path":"/sikw1WcRmqZ5neD179kahrGxxtv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Narratrice","credit_id":"5f4adf48b2681f0031d9d0b7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3030009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuseppe Bottone","original_name":"Giuseppe Bottone","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"himself","credit_id":"60623fbf53866e006a902451","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2759853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessia Bottone","original_name":"Alessia Bottone","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4adf0e64de350035a934fe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2759854,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Martina Dalla Mura","original_name":"Martina Dalla Mura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4adef353f8330033bd5cda","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2759853,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessia Bottone","original_name":"Alessia Bottone","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4adedab2681f0033da0c16","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1459,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xxj6rGCWsIqH8bBvWHpEOPSuVTW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1024}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
