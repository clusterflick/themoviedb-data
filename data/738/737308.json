The film, titled \"New France,\" was left unfinished, first due to lack of funds and then because its author had to go into exile. If the story is familiar to many today, this is because in the '80s Carlos Sorín made' The King's movie ', inspired by that frustrated shoot, in which he had worked as a cinematographer. In 2004, Fresán contacted Turturro to help him rescue the preserved film. Fresán died in that same year, but Turturro decided to retake the trace of that truncated film, exhuming unpublished materials, returning to their original settings and gathering testimonies, to illuminate the two stories - one within the other - that make up this true story, more strange and fascinating than any fiction.","popularity":0.0973,"poster_path":"/bLAVLRWFXtsCn6gcZHP5kjt17Rb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Underdeveloped Overproduction","title":"Un rey para la Patagonia","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Dedovich","original_name":"Miguel Dedovich","popularity":0.1009,"profile_path":"/iTWHO1Ss22y9vD1IFlqbkCEqMDX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60195d8e0f1e580040e7bcc4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2358813,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tomás Eloy Martínez","original_name":"Tomás Eloy Martínez","popularity":0.087,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60195d94d96c3c003f14011e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87510,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Sorin","original_name":"Carlos Sorín","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":"/uweyjMdOLSN6nDAOPF5NipZ6rPc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60195da1d96c3c003f140141","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467051,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adriano Salgado","original_name":"Adriano Salgado","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"656aa0470859b400ad385517","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2364442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Turturro","original_name":"Lucas Turturro","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/q3iC76LuQ8npFwq1m1afoNP840x.jpg","credit_id":"5f4941216cf3d500352c00b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2364442,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lucas Turturro","original_name":"Lucas Turturro","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/q3iC76LuQ8npFwq1m1afoNP840x.jpg","credit_id":"60195db40f1e580041e7efe2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2962151,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Clara Bianchi","original_name":"Clara Bianchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60195de2976a23003faab051","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2249405,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mercedes Tennina","original_name":"Mercedes Tennina","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60195dcebb1057003f97d2ab","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2318180,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sebastián Mega Díaz","original_name":"Sebastián Mega Díaz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60195dc4fb3f61003ec87777","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2962152,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andrea Bruno","original_name":"Andrea Bruno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60195ded1b70ae003d63642d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bLAVLRWFXtsCn6gcZHP5kjt17Rb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Spanish\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"es\", \"native_name\"=>\"Spanish; Castilian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
