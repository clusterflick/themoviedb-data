The revolt would end twenty months later with the death of the last insurgents, shot down by the expeditionary force. France, accustomed to memory lapses, knew nothing of this insurrection and its trail of torture and abuses. In Madagascar, well after independence, the events of 1947 were never discussed. For more than a generation, parents refused to speak of them to their children. It wasn't until the 1980s that the silence was broken.","popularity":0.0965,"poster_path":"/dLDHvnDCPPQbuxuUL6Y8zudYyur.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96497,"logo_path":null,"name":"Betacam SP","origin_country":""},{"id":11332,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept-Arte","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":86197,"logo_path":"/gUTZ1JDzJOytALYfXtPJKI1MqGp.png","name":"Point du Jour","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This film aims to bear witness to a forgotten massacre, during a war of independence sadly similar to the wars in Indochina and Algeria.","title":"Madagascar: The Red Island Uprising","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3908287,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Corinne Godeau","original_name":"Corinne Godeau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e7cce3f1f5376875ddb5fa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1813830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danièle Rousselier","original_name":"Danièle Rousselier","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/aoZeE19ukZa3xMet5Gqex88T1iC.jpg","credit_id":"67e7ccf16b367d469567b793","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3908287,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Corinne Godeau","original_name":"Corinne Godeau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e7cd0b6b367d469567b799","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1813830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danièle Rousselier","original_name":"Danièle Rousselier","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/aoZeE19ukZa3xMet5Gqex88T1iC.jpg","credit_id":"67e7cd1a87145de32d637eca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5335157,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Laetitia Oriol","original_name":"Laetitia Oriol","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e7cf666214525cd5636dc8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1907763,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marc Duployer","original_name":"Marc Duployer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e7cf9e87145de32d637f1d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934721,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Olivier Raffet","original_name":"Olivier Raffet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e7d02b0e8ee6781567b7f0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1813830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danièle Rousselier","original_name":"Danièle Rousselier","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/aoZeE19ukZa3xMet5Gqex88T1iC.jpg","credit_id":"67e7d070f1f5376875ddb7f3","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":827,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dLDHvnDCPPQbuxuUL6Y8zudYyur.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":551}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2041,"name":"island"},{"id":3645,"name":"madagascar"},{"id":10937,"name":"memory"},{"id":187196,"name":"french colonialism"},{"id":215493,"name":"armed conflict"},{"id":230637,"name":"colonial war"},{"id":232569,"name":"political history"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
