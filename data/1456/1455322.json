Aelfie Oudgiri presents \"2nd Annual 2007 Soup Off: the Documentary,\" a fun-loving profile of a tongue-in-cheek event built around an ensemble of soup makers/eaters/judges. Slowly but surely the competitors arrive with their soups to compete for the prize of Best Soup and a range of lesser awards. The host of the event tries to wrangle everyone to begin the soup sampling and voting but obstacles and politics soon begin to surface, and a reminder of shocking allegations from last year's party. As the votes are tallied, competitors are left in a restless state of suspense. A combination of old iMovie text graphics, instrumental music presets, and shaky cam footage covers the event.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2nd Annual 2007 Soup Off: the Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"2nd Annual 2007 Soup Off: the Documentary","key":"NNhWQs1bAUE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-12-11T12:50:05.000Z","id":"67e615f5a6dd9b08080061e7"}]}}}
