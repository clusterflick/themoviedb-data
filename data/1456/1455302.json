Funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, it follows life in Terrace Bay, Ontario—saved by an Indian multinational; Kemijärvi, Finland—where the mill closure devastated the town; and Fray Bentos, Uruguay—where vast eucalyptus plantations feed a massive modern mill. Told in English, French, Finnish, and Spanish, the film reveals how globalization and industry link distant lives and reshape local economies, especially amid Canada’s ongoing mill closures.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/9YfE24lC1FoHYtSp7ZbmEcdTVvr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pulp Friction","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5332701,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kelly Saxberg","original_name":"Kelly Saxberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e606b95e8e5c9bacba64e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2175915,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Harpelle","original_name":"Ron Harpelle","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e606e3f8cba94bbcba43a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9YfE24lC1FoHYtSp7ZbmEcdTVvr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
