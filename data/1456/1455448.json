Involves a family feud intertwined with the smuggling of precious minerals out of the country. From the director:  This is a film whose themes are love, obstacles, hostility, alienation, and the vulgarity of her original character in a confrontation with a different story with an unimaginable portrayal. The “religion” of this human being is based on Kishmaksh, which is full of feelings that are contradictory to each other, and which disappear due to the presence of social and personal obstacles. This is a movie with the eloquence of Darakhshan and a plate with such an impact. It has a deep depth of love, the ugliness and the importance of a different design that I studied in Zindjay with a transfer. It can't be.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/hjzG4rxSiyMg1660x4JjXs12ymp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","name":"Afghanistan"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Religion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","title":"Dain","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1800454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salim Shaheen","original_name":"Salim Shaheen","popularity":0.5625,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67e67e4bf8cba94bbcba5446","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2051571,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muḥammad Akram Khurramı̄","original_name":"Muḥammad Akram Khurramı̄","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"67eaeaf5d52ea23087b6f824","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2051570,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arif Biria","original_name":"Arif Biria","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"67eaeafc71e8dc1129b6f38c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Favād Gulbarg","original_name":"Favād Gulbarg","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"67eaeb13b82f7f7dd3244f23","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1800454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salim Shaheen","original_name":"Salim Shaheen","popularity":0.5625,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e69f775f3e0ac188005daf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2051570,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arif Biria","original_name":"Arif Biria","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67eaead371e8dc1129b6f37b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pHYCRxn3A8OP5e7oBFfviuMmStb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hjzG4rxSiyMg1660x4JjXs12ymp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"فیلم افغانی ( دین ) Afghani movie ( DAIN ) by Salim Shahin","key":"0JnJkYuG65U","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2025-01-09T16:30:06.000Z","id":"67eaeb754958d1f681244e62"}]}}}
