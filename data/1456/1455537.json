Then she searches among the memories, letters, friends, piano, mountain, snow where she was born, the house where her adoptive grandmother lived (and died): Yenia Dumnova. It is a retrospective search, a historical and affective reconstruction made of fragments, memory, documents, fiction.  As she unravels Yenia’s secret story, Laura will recover her own: her relationship with exile, time, family, art, adulthood and death. In this emotional journey, sometimes fictionalized, sometimes narrated by Laura Paredes, the author meets the stories of those who met Yania and remember her with the same wonder and affection as when they frequented her in that convulsive twentieth century.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/frK3PKxgleZ1eSwrZIaJVWYv7c1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un mundo recobrado","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3520355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Laura Bondarevsky","original_name":"Laura Bondarevsky","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e6a9dd5e8e5c9bacba8195","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.724,"height":1023,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/frK3PKxgleZ1eSwrZIaJVWYv7c1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":741}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"43rd International Film Festival of Uruguay","release_date":"2025-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
