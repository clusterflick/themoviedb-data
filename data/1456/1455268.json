Steffie would love to get to the city but is held back by loyalty to her boyfriend Mike and best friend Allie. But when Sebastian Johnson and Kev Plummer, two ageing judges from a struggling reality TV show, arrive in town to run a music competition, Steffie has to make tough decisions. As the week unfolds, Sebastian - Maria's old flame - is confronted with the consequences of his past, and he and Steffie must both work out what is truly important in life. Featuring a superb soundtrack, The Competition is a warm-hearted story of what it really takes to follow your dreams.","popularity":0.1222,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73410,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silversun Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2014-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Competition","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3399993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leah Baulch","original_name":"Leah Baulch","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Steffie","credit_id":"67e5e5e9027e737406001a3a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1520668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dallas Bland","original_name":"Dallas Bland","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/vlPaufLILJ00gdTMqc0KADtiLFj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Clive Woodbridge","credit_id":"67e5e5f9a6dd9b0808005a62","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1520667,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Simon Weaving","original_name":"Simon Weaving","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e5e5dcb8fc39899610c2cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3607360","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
