Kildare and his intern, Dr. Grayson, have a patient needing brain surgery after a head injury but his wife doesn't want to consent. Meanwhile, a young nurse trainee gets emotionally involved, making her wonder if she will be effective as a nurse. When the patient finally consents to surgery, the anesthesiologist informs the doctors of complications, leading Kildare to a diagnosis of beryllium poisoning. Meanwhile, Kildare's intern is wanting to leave Blair and start what appears to be a lucrative practice. Kildare, in an effort to keep the intern at Blair, intervenes to get another departing intern the job. The surgery is a success, with both the intern and the nurse having learned something about themselves from the experience.","popularity":1.1938,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dr. Kildare (Unaired Pilot)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lew Ayres","original_name":"Lew Ayres","popularity":0.4086,"profile_path":"/nNinKMWvSxrhiNMnMkbpUd4HEZO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr. Kildare","credit_id":"67e6182b3e65c8ea88ba30cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1304422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Cronin","original_name":"Joseph Cronin","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dr. Grayson","credit_id":"67e6183ca6dd9b0808006257","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Tedrow","original_name":"Irene Tedrow","popularity":0.7425,"profile_path":"/5cA7e5tOsSxlEzuBKeAiVDeORYL.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Fern Davis","credit_id":"67e6184a3e65c8ea88ba30d3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":102841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maggie Pierce","original_name":"Maggie Pierce","popularity":0.1558,"profile_path":"/tOWekDYMVuVMqer2WQVIjb3URK0.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Linda Blaine","credit_id":"67e618583e65c8ea88ba30dc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Forest","original_name":"Michael Forest","popularity":1.0314,"profile_path":"/zG1BVNsy3htNKAtZvihWD3btEWN.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mr. Delaney","credit_id":"67e6186c33a74341e310d125","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eileen Ryan","original_name":"Eileen Ryan","popularity":0.3001,"profile_path":"/fLyoFNUCteI0VgLEH2V44HX0PeF.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Mrs. Delaney","credit_id":"67e6189c5e8e5c9bacba66f8","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15766,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Newland","original_name":"John Newland","popularity":0.1433,"profile_path":"/14R1MvDdlHlgG4sPaDVJmYzAhOG.jpg","credit_id":"67e6180e5e8e5c9bacba66c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70980,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Pirosh","original_name":"Robert Pirosh","popularity":0.2204,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e6181de8a1910e6510da87","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96246,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Collier Young","original_name":"Collier Young","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e618aa5f3e0ac1880047b1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1761,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alexander Courage","original_name":"Alexander Courage","popularity":0.2176,"profile_path":"/nVTrM70knWjQcOvATsu2Uric9sl.jpg","credit_id":"67e618bb5e8e5c9bacba66fc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3110542,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dale Deverman","original_name":"Dale Deverman","popularity":0.0573,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e618c73e65c8ea88ba311a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174596,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Henry Berman","original_name":"Henry Berman","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e618d3e8a1910e6510dab3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10604,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"George W.
