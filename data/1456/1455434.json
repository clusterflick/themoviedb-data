But Almudena is no longer here.  The aim of this film is to keep her memory alive: to celebrate her life and work without forgetting the painful void left by her passing. Luis García Montero, her husband, steps into that void and, in doing so, completes the intimate portrait of a writer who, like few others, has been able to tell the story of our lives.","popularity":0.0647,"poster_path":"/5GHFiljC5CR9zurX3WE4qrm4Fbm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7680,"logo_path":"/aZ5xfV3J3kSShvHxo06ypgE2QBD.png","name":"Tornasol Media","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2025-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Almudena","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":149306,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Almudena Grandes","original_name":"Almudena Grandes","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/kZFhs60ijyMyNWDzweiNPjt5aPe.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"67e67bc95e8e5c9bacba7628","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3011056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis García Montero","original_name":"Luis García Montero","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/5jWvSAl32g56yt0C7K9uYGNOAWz.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"67e67c11030c246b1e109340","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050783,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Azucena Rodríguez","original_name":"Azucena Rodríguez","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/ed6f61M3qLMCvwOYZ0SmhfUkY8f.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"67e67c74f8cba94bbcba53ad","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050783,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Azucena Rodríguez","original_name":"Azucena Rodríguez","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/ed6f61M3qLMCvwOYZ0SmhfUkY8f.jpg","credit_id":"67e67945b8fc39899610cd1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71926,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mariela Besuievsky","original_name":"Mariela Besuievsky","popularity":0.0909,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e67975030c246b1e10920f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Barrero","original_name":"Juan Barrero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e679d1f8cba94bbcba533e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1050783,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Azucena Rodríguez","original_name":"Azucena Rodríguez","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":"/ed6f61M3qLMCvwOYZ0SmhfUkY8f.jpg","credit_id":"67e67b105e8e5c9bacba75f4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2385010,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"David Mayo","original_name":"David Mayo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e67b435e8e5c9bacba7607","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1284828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Barrero","original_name":"Juan Barrero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e67b5d5e8e5c9bacba760b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3702823,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Leonor Segovia","original_name":"Leonor Segovia","popularity":0.0609,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e67b73027e737406004155","department":"Editing","job":"Additional Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230573,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Carlos Cañas Carreira","original_name":"Carlos Cañas Carreira","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/6bZ6ABB6p6tvJUyu5yQcfHGu6dz.jpg","credit_id":"67e67b8a5e8e5c9bacba7617","department":"Editing","job":"Additional Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5333207,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rosa Torres Pardo","original_name":"Rosa Torres Pardo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e67ba75e8e5c9bacba7620","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35930168","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/itH563cRG2yxY06TPfwV5nXpQ2J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/5GHFiljC5CR9zurX3WE4qrm4Fbm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":839}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Festival de Málaga","release_date":"2025-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
