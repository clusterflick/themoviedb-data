Video is based on a song I heard on my dream. When waking up I could not recall it anymore. Several months later it suddenly came to me again. I found a skull from the forest, perhaps a fox, mice had eaten some of it. I turned it around and saw something creepy, like face of a devil, and as walking back to a house I start humming the song from my dream; 'Don't go home with Satan, he will eat your children'. Skull became a character and I build the story around it.\"","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/nioJJRksGocFit6cFMytF4fsYpp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Go Home with Satan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5332143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saana Inari","original_name":"Saana Inari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e5bce3f8cba94bbcba3b0d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5332143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saana Inari","original_name":"Saana Inari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e5bd9533a74341e310c05e","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5332143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saana Inari","original_name":"Saana Inari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e5bda4a6dd9b08080051b5","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5332143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Saana Inari","original_name":"Saana Inari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e5bdc333a74341e310c066","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nioJJRksGocFit6cFMytF4fsYpp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
