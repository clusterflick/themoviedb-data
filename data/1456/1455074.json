Based on an Alice Munro short story, Thanks for the Ride is about values and morals, expectations and broken dreams, class differences and peer pressure. It is also about the overwhelming intensity of adolescent emotions and that momentous event--the first sexual encounter. An excellent film for use in family life, values education, Canadian literature, and creative writing courses.","popularity":0.2557,"poster_path":"/e1sfaBO60LFGlKEGtPXIsRfhyzf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thanks for the Ride","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":563092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lesleh Donaldson","original_name":"Lesleh Donaldson","popularity":0.1541,"profile_path":"/bPCKOjo6cavFi3y0cz5qN0iglOz.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"67e57a76f846794e9910c2cd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1233416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melissa Bell","original_name":"Melissa Bell","popularity":0.0995,"profile_path":"/b3l6qlhOBtzYhTr8KrlohasG0xE.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"67e57a84f846794e9910c2d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123320,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Krantz","original_name":"Peter Krantz","popularity":0.0742,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"67e57a8e33a74341e310b1b4","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131240,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Marotte","original_name":"Carl Marotte","popularity":0.3381,"profile_path":"/jsoiEwcqEZWIlU8GDuiQkTLK2pQ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"67e57a98421eb8c331ba59ea","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Kent Harrison","original_name":"John Kent Harrison","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e579fa5f0bfa0b66ba4c07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Kent Harrison","original_name":"John Kent Harrison","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e57a02f846794e9910c2c2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2797279,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Kramer","original_name":"John Kramer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e57a132074b0ee56004de8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1034809,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Spotton","original_name":"John Spotton","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e57a2333a74341e310b190","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36165,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rene Ohashi","original_name":"Rene Ohashi","popularity":0.1057,"profile_path":"/biSYJN9XKkeElQU9HgZ3zRXugzU.jpg","credit_id":"67e57a35421eb8c331ba59ca","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1714505,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bryan Day","original_name":"Bryan Day","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e57a4d2580eef1e8005aef","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64766,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roger Mattiussi","original_name":"Roger Mattiussi","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e57a562074b0ee56004def","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29294,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lawrence Shragge","original_name":"Lawrence Shragge","popularity":0.1441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e57a64421eb8c331ba59de","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19947,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alice Munro","original_name":"Alice Munro","popularity":0.0564,"profile_path":"/vd7kiXNAWOYVObbl5FWjmfXl1d8.jpg","credit_id":"67e57aee5e8e5c9bacba53dd","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3591028","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/e1sfaBO60LFGlKEGtPXIsRfhyzf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1983-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
