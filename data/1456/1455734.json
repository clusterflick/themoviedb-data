Instead, she drowns herself in her work, shutting out the world.  When her older brother secretly gets accepted into college without telling her, Jo is forced to rethink her priorities and reevaluate what truly matters in her life.  On a whim, Jo decides to hike the California coast as a summer pilgrimage.  To her surprise, her clueless and well-meaning father agrees to join her, turning her personal journey into the most dysfunctional father-daughter road trip imaginable.  Together, they navigate the wild beauty of the California coastline and confront the emotional challenges theyâ€™ve both been avoiding.  Along the way, Jo and her dad discover the power of love, healing, and learning to let go. Jo is a quirky, heartfelt indie family film about rediscovering connection and finding oneself through the journey of grief and growth.","popularity":0.6308,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pilgrim","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1497861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Purdy","original_name":"Doug Purdy","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Tom","credit_id":"67e7200d6deb8da720dd8ccc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5334307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scout Purdy","original_name":"Scout Purdy","popularity":0.1564,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Joe","credit_id":"67e72031b5655aac42635e44","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":113818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenica Bergere","original_name":"Jenica Bergere","popularity":0.3868,"profile_path":"/kyyH5jMD38hZySs6WfVv8jrpurW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Alexis","credit_id":"67e721536deb8da720dd8d7b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2634300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxwell Purdy","original_name":"Maxwell Purdy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ellis","credit_id":"67e721740e8ee6781567a0ee","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Bollman","original_name":"Ryan Bollman","popularity":0.2769,"profile_path":"/jShOCZc85aSt1yPI3QPKioS1TM5.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Derek","credit_id":"67e7218ff1f5376875dd8d7b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1497861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Purdy","original_name":"Doug Purdy","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e721b26deb8da720dd8db7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1497861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Purdy","original_name":"Doug Purdy","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e721c76deb8da720dd8dba","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5334307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scout Purdy","original_name":"Scout Purdy","popularity":0.1564,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e721dcb5655aac42635f5c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5334307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scout Purdy","original_name":"Scout Purdy","popularity":0.1564,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e721ebb5655aac42635f60","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23784324","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
