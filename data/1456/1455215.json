More than a means of survival, Tom’s daily routine represents his deep connection to the community around him. When his essential cart was stolen in 2024, the town responded with unexpected generosity, coming together to support one of their own. Directed by Jake Jakubowski, this film captures the power of perseverance, the beauty of small-town solidarity, and the profound impact of everyday kindness.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/7nbEzk01Q3JnemfFrjy8SAUjVmV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171778,"logo_path":"/cokOtOB626rXnJ69EjSgBKXydOG.png","name":"DMJ Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"A Story of Resilience and Community","title":"Tom the Bottleman","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3469495,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jake Jakubowski","original_name":"Jake Jakubowski","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":"/5R6cJCzJwKcVi8Qe2SWO42glEzZ.jpg","credit_id":"67e5c84ea6dd9b080800549d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36282427","wikidata_id":"Q133504687","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7nbEzk01Q3JnemfFrjy8SAUjVmV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6747,"name":"recycling"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Tom the Bottleman | Teaser","key":"m02WKCr91fU","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2025-02-26T11:51:19.000Z","id":"67e5c8e25f3e0ac188003f46"}]}}}
