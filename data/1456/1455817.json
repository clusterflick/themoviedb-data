The film tells of two young people whose career ambitions seem constantly to be thwarted. Their scramble to make a living leads both of them through a succession of odd jobs and, by a strange twist of fate, to a remote lumbering camp. In following their picaresque adventures, the film explores the attitudes needed for surviving in an uncertain world and promotes reflection on how to bridge the gap between ideals and reality.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/3tvU3EqIvXyVGb59mwYvf745TEI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diploma Dilemma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1068381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernard Carez","original_name":"Bernard Carez","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67e741436b367d469567a250","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1282420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Geertsen","original_name":"George Geertsen","popularity":0.0797,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e7414d8f303d2f95dd9139","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1282420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Geertsen","original_name":"George Geertsen","popularity":0.0797,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e74152bd1f96f9ef636125","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1331997,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Douglas Macdonald","original_name":"Douglas Macdonald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e74160bd1f96f9ef63613b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1397105,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Pettigrew","original_name":"William Pettigrew","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e7416a6b367d469567a262","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5334513,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Name","original_name":"Nick Name","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e741808f303d2f95dd9150","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0236156","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.763,"height":845,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3tvU3EqIvXyVGb59mwYvf745TEI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":645}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
