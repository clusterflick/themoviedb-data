At Okehazama, Oda Nobunaga of Owari, rumored to be a fool, spectacularly defeated Imagawa Yoshimoto of Mikawa as he was leading a much larger host than Nobunaga's toward the capital city, Miyako. Nobunaga has decided to take Yoshimoto's place and lead his own forces to Miyako, so he is compelled to ally with the Azai clan in order to suppress Mino, a province lying between Owari and Miyako, by having his younger sister Oichi wed Nagamasa, the Azai clan's sucessor. However, Mino is also the birthplace of Nobunaga's wife, Kichou. Her former retainers and people are in Mino, and Kichou is vehemently opposed to the province's destruction, even if it is now in the hands of an enemy who overthrew her father, Saitou Dousan. But Nobunaga, who has embarked upon his path to conquest, holds to his course.","popularity":0.1171,"poster_path":"/4uzj0BX3zmS7RfEhEKshQwutHbB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NOBUNAGA -The Will to Power-","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3073407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masaki Ryū","original_name":"龍真咲","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/gPKvORRXU3SaK8Gh3KqAkIN14mb.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Oda Nobunaga","credit_id":"67e63546421eb8c331ba7aeb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3378405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manaki Reika","original_name":"愛希れいか","popularity":0.0735,"profile_path":"/rjLzFjHcgg6sPJyQtyAc6FTNObY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kichou","credit_id":"67e63552421eb8c331ba7af1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3829772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryo Tamaki","original_name":"珠城りょう","popularity":0.1094,"profile_path":"/ycolSKVtWf6Exin1GVC6SHSP9HY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Giovanni Roltes","credit_id":"67e6355e030c246b1e108743","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3571555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miya Rurika","original_name":"美弥るりか","popularity":0.1301,"profile_path":"/8hxImwPsgyCI3s6wVUSMIzJcOD1.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hashiba Hideyoshi","credit_id":"67e6357a030c246b1e108755","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3447298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nagina Ruumi","original_name":"凪七瑠海","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/neLeysq0ZRuxdtZZViGJtE9msWJ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Akechi Mitsuhide","credit_id":"67e63588030c246b1e10875c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3931364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uzuki Hayate","original_name":"Uzuki Hayate","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fzgJbdwWA6iHRArRVgYXnw3cHDi.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Azai Nagamasa","credit_id":"67e6359d027e737406002d3d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3347784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jun Asami","original_name":"朝美絢","popularity":0.2433,"profile_path":"/u7ip8C8Z2vnneG0WwyTw7Zue8xG.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tsumaki / Mori Ranmaru","credit_id":"67e635c7030c246b1e108775","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3387848,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Umino Mitsuki","original_name":"海乃美月","popularity":0.0678,"profile_path":"/waZWEqfd6SW8Vdk5mcmOEJpcVqh.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"O-Ichi","credit_id":"67e635d2027e737406002d41","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3387864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chisei Akatsuki","original_name":"暁千星","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/ytXuuQ2QA7HQjkL8oLBvVh4nhde.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sawaki Yoshiyuki","credit_id":"67e635dc5f3e0ac188004ad7","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3812667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oono Takuji","original_name":"大野拓史","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/g3daQNx9UjABbt0DN00drEpDKkv.jpg","credit_id":"67e63687030c246b1e1087b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7swaLLnVWjiJc0KFloZOQyz6dBc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4uzj0BX3zmS7RfEhEKshQwutHbB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276810,"name":"takarazuka"},{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
