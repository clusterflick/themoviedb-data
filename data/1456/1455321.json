The film follows Amos' journey to understand his single, alcoholic father. He travels to a liquor store armed with his father's ID to buy alcohol, but no matter his determination to present himself as his father, everything keeps going wrong. Eventually, on his way home, he passes by a Sunday mass service and attends service to get drunk on the Communion wine. After tasting alcohol, meeting unlikely friends, and going on the journey of a lifetime, Amos has to decide whether or not he can find contempt in the incomprehension of his father's illness.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/aPfxUSA0OPhu2fQtIuC4mTsey8C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":190305,"logo_path":null,"name":"ur girlfriends favorite films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Thrilling Adventure of Amos Waters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5332742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Burris","original_name":"Eric Burris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Amos Waters","credit_id":"67e6136633a74341e310cf9e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4031994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gavin Thomas Daly","original_name":"Gavin Thomas Daly","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/iaLM6JQLOvGn4mZdfx5RwIWQKSx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"John the Altar Boy","credit_id":"67e613723e65c8ea88ba2ef9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5332743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sayla Thompson","original_name":"Sayla Thompson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Bianca","credit_id":"67e613865f3e0ac188004749","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4658123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damon Waters","original_name":"Damon Waters","popularity":0.0971,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dad","credit_id":"67e6138d3e65c8ea88ba2efe","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2674343,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ella Janes","original_name":"Ella Janes","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e613a0e8a1910e6510d9eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2515206,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paris Burris","original_name":"Paris Burris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/1WablJKGMqo7BFSiIkbyxFL3VD2.jpg","credit_id":"67e613a93e65c8ea88ba2f07","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5332744,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dillon Milner","original_name":"Dillon Milner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e613b63e65c8ea88ba2f11","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b93PuYF6WKxvI6za2yT7JYcFvRu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aPfxUSA0OPhu2fQtIuC4mTsey8C.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
