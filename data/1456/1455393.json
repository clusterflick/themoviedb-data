The story is collectively told. Three things magnetize its parts: the Great Rift Valley, where continental plates spread apart, birthing new earth; the 3.2 million year old female hominid Dink'inesh aka 'Lucy,' who was found there; and Azmari tradition, a form of social singing used to critique power and narrate current events. Azmari women still perform today, but who are their descendants? A search for their conceptual inheritors populates and drives the film.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":45492,"logo_path":"/d2W0LDHhQxPXTzfhJqRw3dWvdCv.png","name":"Pythagoras Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"ET","name":"Ethiopia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Amharic","iso_639_1":"am","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Oromo","iso_639_1":"om","name":""}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Hello Ladies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":120970,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deborah Stratman","original_name":"Deborah Stratman","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/5HV0VtAEaC6h8hyNNk8SFGgH1Ze.jpg","credit_id":"67e646e8027e73740600319c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":120970,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Deborah Stratman","original_name":"Deborah Stratman","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/5HV0VtAEaC6h8hyNNk8SFGgH1Ze.jpg","credit_id":"67e646ef5e8e5c9bacba6c82","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
