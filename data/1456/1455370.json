Cho Moon-sang served as a prison guard, while Noh Su-bok endured suffering as a \"comfort woman.\" Heo Yeong, a propaganda officer for the Japanese army, produced films that distorted the realities of POW camps. After the war ended in 1945, Cho was sentenced to death as a war criminal. Unable to return to Korea due to his collaboration, Heo aided Korean prison guards in their escape. Noh, rather than returning home, chose to remain in Thailand and rebuild her life.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Return of Forgotten Words","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2719833,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeong Su-eun","original_name":"Jeong Su-eun","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/2uQZftuwAGRuMZGwBp4QwFt0OoX.jpg","credit_id":"67e63a193e65c8ea88ba368c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5332936,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kim Sung-kyung","original_name":"Kim Sung-kyung","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e63a2e5e8e5c9bacba6b25","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
