Zarif sings a sad Tatar song, which he sang with his beloved Kashifa in peacetime. The Finnish sniper Ziyatdin turned out to be a Tatar, to whom his mother sang this song as a child. This is how the Soviet soldier Zarif and the Finnish sniper Ziyatdin met and became friends. Who are they - enemies or brothers? These are eternal questions to which there is only one answer: the most important thing in your life is love. Everything in your life has meaning only when there is Love in it.","popularity":0.0418,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2024-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Немая кукушка","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Nemaya kukushka","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5333041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zulfat Khakim","original_name":"Зульфат Хаким","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"67e659db33a74341e310dd17","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5333042,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eldar Gataullin","original_name":"Эльдар Гатауллин","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67e659ed421eb8c331ba8116","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5333043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saida Mukhametzyanova","original_name":"Саида Мухаметзянова","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67e659fca6dd9b0808006b24","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5333044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ilsaf Nazipov","original_name":"Ильсаф Назипов","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"67e65a0ff846794e9910e56d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1282723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rauf Kubaev","original_name":"Рауф Кубаев","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e65a3af8cba94bbcba4c95","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Altyn Minbar Kazan International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
