One day marks the end to their days of peace and quiet. The King is transformed into a tyrant through a magical spell by the Queen's sister. The King loses interest in his once-tranquil existence and falls under the woman's spell, becoming addicted to extravagance and gambling. The King banishes the Queen and summons her sister to take her place. The King and the Queen's sister eventually give birth to a prince. A short time later, the King passes away. Eager that her own son becomes the new King, the woman uses her magic to turn the first-born Prince into a wild beast. The spell will be broken on the day he encounters a woman who is not bothered by outside appearances and is capable of seeing through to the truth.","popularity":0.1394,"poster_path":"/p3lwupa4EKS9B6HsBXszwnd8X9S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prince of the Land of Roses","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3533559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiriya Hiromu","original_name":"霧矢大夢","popularity":0.147,"profile_path":"/htHzExODogYCWKrcgsr6Y45xVAj.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Beast","credit_id":"67e6496633a74341e310d95a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3819572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aono Yuki","original_name":"Aono Yuki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/6eofivlDprkw4HM84zXMdMAsavc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Belle","credit_id":"67e649705f3e0ac188004dc3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3073407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masaki Ryū","original_name":"龍真咲","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/gPKvORRXU3SaK8Gh3KqAkIN14mb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The King","credit_id":"67e64979b8fc39899610c8c8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2706179,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rio Asumi","original_name":"明日海りお","popularity":0.2692,"profile_path":"/8Vj0dTfg9wuDnbz1JAD8EC9A73T.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Retainer","credit_id":"67e64984030c246b1e108aeb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3829772,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryo Tamaki","original_name":"珠城りょう","popularity":0.1094,"profile_path":"/ycolSKVtWf6Exin1GVC6SHSP9HY.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hummingbird","credit_id":"67e64995027e73740600325b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3935793,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kimura Shinji","original_name":"Kimura Shinji","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e649ae33a74341e310d982","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lfM5mkekxomM9J8Lm7xqYuFUBlY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p3lwupa4EKS9B6HsBXszwnd8X9S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276810,"name":"takarazuka"},{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2011-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
