Hirano used Masahiro Sugiyama, the star of his film “The Thunderfish,” to shoot the film, and Hideto Ishii shows his commitment to light. Nanao also brought a saxophonist, Toru Nishiuchi, and had him blow his saxophone in the street, much to the dismay of the audience. The participants on the rooftop at this time can be seen in “Aitai”. As a result, two films were made in one day.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"GAMUZE 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2388910,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mikio Yamazaki","original_name":"山崎幹夫","popularity":0.1033,"profile_path":"/djBtyiHT9PMItgTkTVcjglqlIe7.jpg","credit_id":"67e672623e65c8ea88ba3ab5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"Nekoya...Yamazaki Mikio's collection (Tokyo, Image Forum)","release_date":"1988-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
