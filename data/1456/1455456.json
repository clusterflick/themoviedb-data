More than three years ago, he was struck by a car in the city centre; he died of the injuries. Now he wanders the streets, unseen by the living, waiting to find out if he'll be sent up or down. He fills his days walking, going to movies, and thinking. He regrets that he didn't dispose of his stash of pornography - he meant to. His grieving widow found it. Every two weeks, he goes to grief therapy. He waits.","popularity":0.079,"poster_path":"/k4hRCMi3KKDckGwJCxxTG9X3Qob.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":257722,"logo_path":null,"name":"Incidental Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laid Off","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1716476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Paul Hurley","original_name":"John Paul Hurley","popularity":0.0993,"profile_path":"/2ErbBaKup4Ikn8fqbI5WTLjIHog.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Martin","credit_id":"67e685135e8e5c9bacba7988","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2403603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Ritchie","original_name":"Steve Ritchie","popularity":0.2156,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Mike","credit_id":"67e685395f3e0ac188005775","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4656129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vicky Allan","original_name":"Vicky Allan","popularity":0.0638,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Michelle","credit_id":"67e6854f030c246b1e10970b","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":2187110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Ross","original_name":"John Ross","popularity":1.38,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Brendan","credit_id":"67e6857114bba6ae31002aa2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Waitt","original_name":"Chris Waitt","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":"/7Zd0qJv4Zy4BH1a47MRQW2lk9wW.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Counsellor","credit_id":"67e68586030c246b1e109713","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5333234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Knight","original_name":"Claire Knight","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Wife","credit_id":"67e685b2030c246b1e109737","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5333282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Moran","original_name":"Jack Moran","popularity":0.2257,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"John","credit_id":"67e68f95421eb8c331ba8752","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2992771,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Jaeson Finn","original_name":"Jaeson Finn","popularity":0.239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Jay","credit_id":"67e68fc8027e737406004a0c","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1140786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zam Salim","original_name":"Zam Salim","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e6846433a74341e310ebe8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1140786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zam Salim","original_name":"Zam Salim","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e68474027e737406004433","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1140786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zam Salim","original_name":"Zam Salim","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e6849533a74341e310ebf4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1140786,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zam Salim","original_name":"Zam Salim","popularity":0.0722,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e684ae14bba6ae31002a4c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4986328,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ray Tallan","original_name":"Ray Tallan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e684c4030c246b1e1096d1","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0816087","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k4hRCMi3KKDckGwJCxxTG9X3Qob.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-04-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Laid Off (FULL FILM)","key":"3UlAeQ_ko34","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2011-10-14T03:37:03.000Z","id":"67e6842b027e73740600442a"}]}}}
