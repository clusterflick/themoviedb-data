Yet few tourists visit the southernmost of Japan's main islands. This documentary contrasts modern Japanese cities with traditional customs in the countryside.  The rail journey begins in Fukuoka - a city with a metro population of 2.5 million - and ends at the southern tip of the island, in the city of Ibusuki. As the train rolls along, it travels through time - and reveals the amazing diversity and contrasts of the most southerly of Japan's four main islands. The trip provides spectacular landscape views, as well as deep insight into a foreign culture, and its ancient traditions and modern lifestyles.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/4nPCV98zbIerzq3LWeAvF7dA4nV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Train Ride Into Japan's Past","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2874855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harald Kirchner","original_name":"Harald Kirchner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67e78af60e8ee6781567acb7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1348,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4nPCV98zbIerzq3LWeAvF7dA4nV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":898}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
