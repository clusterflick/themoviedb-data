In a solo tour de force, Melora Hardin (NBC's The Office) powerfully and painfully embodies the end product of Hollywood's use-them-up and spit-them-out machinery. Drunk and alone, Golden Vanity is Ms. Montgomery-Mayflower's last chance to preserve her horrifying, hilarious and unreliable truth - one last shot to relive the glory days, before it's too late.","popularity":0.6643,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":76433,"logo_path":null,"name":"Occasional
