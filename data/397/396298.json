Conner combined street views of San Francisco shot in the late 1950s with scenes of rural Oaxaca captured during his “mushroom-hunting” excursions between 1961 and 1962, when Bruce and his wife, Jean, were living in Mexico City. On at least one of these trips, the Conners were joined by Timothy Leary, the ex-Harvard professor and soon-to-be leading proponent of psychedelic drugs.  In 1996, Conner revised the film once again: he used an optical printer to expand its length from three to fourteen-and-a-half-minutes, and added a new soundtrack, Terry Riley's \"Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band,\" to create a more meditative, but no less hypnotizing, iteration of the mushroom hunt.","popularity":0.07,"poster_path":"/rnnioyK0GRSYgvyns5mVCpDMQpK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking for Mushrooms","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bruce Conner","original_name":"Bruce Conner","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":"/mw0E9AMe6vmSQfAfTQx53KgfIGU.jpg","credit_id":"572c8413c3a3680140001f2b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1499735,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Terry Riley","original_name":"Terry Riley","popularity":0.09,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6803aa024315ae6d9aad0692","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0309809","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5wMmjlTSQPcaiXwVHcj8bCJGp0H.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rnnioyK0GRSYgvyns5mVCpDMQpK.jpg","vote_average":1.222,"vote_count":3,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
