Because of an immigration impediment, Adul consigns Mariel to the care of her cousin Jaime (Eddie Gutierrez) and nursemaid Dolor (Janice De Belen), the midwife at Mariel's birth. But Jaime's wife Laila (Charo Santos) doesn't want to keep the baby because the sight of an infant reminds her of her own stillborn child, and Dolor's boyfriend Ramir is jealous of the love and attention Dolor gives the baby. Just when Laila has accepted Mariel, Adul returns to claim her adopted now-grown daughter, but Dolor inadvertently learns of Adul's wicked plan to sell Mariel for a large amount.","popularity":0.705,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":63793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vision Films [ph]","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1991-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Film that will capture your heart","title":"When Will You Be Mine","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1082061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janice de Belen","original_name":"Janice de Belen","popularity":0.5084,"profile_path":"/1FSDnC4RviNJkNVCoe3oABKm9A0.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Dolor","credit_id":"572a30fec3a36827a4000217","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabby Concepcion","original_name":"Gabby Concepcion","popularity":0.7265,"profile_path":"/ooHkctI3mnoJUnIyOwO4FzBdbPQ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ramil","credit_id":"572a311792514109f4000237","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1019359,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charo Santos-Concio","original_name":"Charo Santos-Concio","popularity":0.1995,"profile_path":"/dLuewCQj4GqnzHg4uCxmW2ypXt6.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Leila","credit_id":"572a312ec3a368279900025d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":823910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Gutierrez","original_name":"Eddie Gutierrez","popularity":0.2517,"profile_path":"/3AeYphipqXN8bHs7RJfbv3mxn4H.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jaime","credit_id":"572a31589251410f650001d9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1004548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivian Velez","original_name":"Vivian Velez","popularity":0.3419,"profile_path":"/gZc5ercCJlI6ec2CN7chzhsbirc.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Adul","credit_id":"572a3178c3a36827ae00023c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":934088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julio Díaz","original_name":"Julio Diaz","popularity":0.2642,"profile_path":"/4ZsTf2VoV1R9NpN5zjMQMhWIHiO.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Ben","credit_id":"572a318d92514109fe000257","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":239059,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gina Alajar","original_name":"Gina Alajar","popularity":0.2797,"profile_path":"/ckDzJeJAhZ2IIm37B9tzmTyS1DA.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Shirley","credit_id":"572a31a492514109eb00024f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1014965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmina Villarroel","original_name":"Carmina Villarroel","popularity":0.3304,"profile_path":"/oMlogNix6P6tNEuHEAbh6tiGbHA.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Tess","credit_id":"572a31bc92514109e900025c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":278926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cherry Pie Picache","original_name":"Cherry Pie Picache","popularity":0.2661,"profile_path":"/rKMoeZIUsSrVEbA4oMeq8zZ00RN.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Lyn","credit_id":"572a31e092514109fe00025d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1230971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lady Lee","original_name":"Lady Lee","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Mariel","credit_id":"572a3203c3a3682795000228","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1206499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cris Daluz","original_name":"Cris Daluz","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Zaldy","credit_id":"6800f809ef5ae687cbd9e248","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1043127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vangie Labalan","original_name":"Vangie Labalan","popularity":0.275,"profile_path":"/tJQj1tdd3FsqY5G6B3xMXq1HC2k.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Doreng","credit_id":"6800f816ef5ae687cbd9e250","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Sagmit","original_name":"Ben Sagmit","popularity":0.0584,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Bito (Houseboy)","credit_id":"6800f830aacf7cfb269a2fb2","order":12}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chito S.
