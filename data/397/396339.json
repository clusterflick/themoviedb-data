Carver, arch enemy of Evans and a rival for the love of Carol Sheldon, fails in an attempt to spoil the audition.

Carver blames Evans for all of the Sheldon's troubles and, what with one thing or another, it looks like Evans and his cowhands will miss the big broadcast.","popularity":0.5743,"poster_path":"/v5pcWKwEOZXfrig4Abs4r8PYIQ6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73803,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reliable Pictures Corporation (I)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bronzed sons of the west in a series of pulse-quickening adventures!","title":"Santa Fe Rides","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Custer","original_name":"Bob Custer","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/7eJDFfFBYki6nDErCtekBPYHNgL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Santa Fe Evans","credit_id":"572d0def92514165ee000c5c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":88731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleanor Stewart","original_name":"Eleanor Stewart","popularity":0.1257,"profile_path":"/7T9bOBQI8UAVd8kqaxe9XhrXE4b.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Carol Sheldon","credit_id":"572d0dfac3a3680fe5000bb3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Cassidy","original_name":"Ed Cassidy","popularity":0.1492,"profile_path":"/lxg59gPbrG2C2DZ666WotYk4akm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mr. Allen","credit_id":"572d0e0692514165ee000c63","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Sharpe","original_name":"David Sharpe","popularity":0.2479,"profile_path":"/n8AaxxHG0ocOBV3uPm0zuuHoz0x.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Buddy Sheldon","credit_id":"572d0e10c3a3680f3f0002fc","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Williams","original_name":"Roger Williams","popularity":0.0899,"profile_path":"/wkjFYG4XVg3C2gCdR6ddijFbRDv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Carver","credit_id":"61b4f237bfeb8b0042404cfd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Slim Whitaker","original_name":"Slim Whitaker","popularity":0.1287,"profile_path":"/jrDw1jXr26U7XC4lTSbwUHCohf6.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Henchman Al Jensen","credit_id":"61b4f24658efd3004178d767","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124634,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lafe McKee","original_name":"Lafe McKee","popularity":0.1904,"profile_path":"/iDR6BFkx3vJY9dN3LA3bNTAK24J.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"'Dad' Sheldon","credit_id":"61b4f253894ed6004059dd4c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Elliott","original_name":"John Elliott","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":"/jm8Y332hX8swK7FpB0PcAIWQyrB.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Carlton","credit_id":"61b4f2612d8ef3001cc0bb97","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry 'Snub' Pollard","original_name":"Harry 'Snub' Pollard","popularity":0.3279,"profile_path":"/srCQa37TG3RHKx5PuthzjsTpe6n.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Stubby","credit_id":"61b4f2704cd912009835c842","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nelson McDowell","original_name":"Nelson McDowell","popularity":0.0992,"profile_path":"/c9WodDYcxUL0P5X1zq1DVgJXogG.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Andy","credit_id":"61b4f2832d8ef30042bc3199","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1141612,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tom Gibson","original_name":"Tom Gibson","popularity":0.102,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"572d0dd992514165f5000b0c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard B.
