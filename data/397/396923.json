Bird blazed a trail from the radical hotbed of the Royal Court Theatre in the 70s, via the groundbreaking early days of EastEnders and Casualty in the 80s, all the way to Hollywood in the 90s and back again. She always had something urgent to say, but her career was a long struggle to get her voice heard. Featuring many of her close collaborators, including Robert Carlyle, Irvine Welsh, Kate Hardie and Mark Cousins, this documentary is the first to examine Bird’s legacy, and to place her where she belongs – among the most important British film, TV and theatre directors of her era.","popularity":1.6183,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antonia Bird: From EastEnders to Hollywood","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonia Bird","original_name":"Antonia Bird","popularity":0.107,"profile_path":"/kDAJuRpVmVK4hCpmrXLfzufIFId.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"616c97361365450064dcd3eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Hardie","original_name":"Kate Hardie","popularity":0.3869,"profile_path":"/8I1b516zBQ4ALa9LNGR8lAJm2OD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5731f507925141197c001575","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18023,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Carlyle","original_name":"Robert Carlyle","popularity":1.6465,"profile_path":"/yOdTewlmmvxqDaKbWJ7eAk0ULCf.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5731f4f4c3a368346b00175d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Cousins","original_name":"Mark Cousins","popularity":0.1609,"profile_path":"/f5B9kcpJXLETRYwRZJmvKmiWfLu.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5731f50ec3a36803b900030c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8998,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Irvine Welsh","original_name":"Irvine Welsh","popularity":0.2396,"profile_path":"/qdKADentsEzCtGYyc7NoEmGyN12.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5731f500925141439f0001e7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Mackintosh","original_name":"Steven Mackintosh","popularity":0.7375,"profile_path":"/vDA4mmVe0XMnqd6qMyGWI8bUEeC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5731f5159251413fb8003635","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Dobson","original_name":"Anita Dobson","popularity":0.5269,"profile_path":"/nhx0mjdEIFVzMkgm7VmsTvtme3U.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"616c97808f26bc004628af07","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51675,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Finola Dwyer","original_name":"Finola Dwyer","popularity":0.159,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"616c9788a097dc00920498f4","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34885,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pippa Harris","original_name":"Pippa Harris","popularity":0.1325,"profile_path":"/wiRDzUHEvPOGJiEIWysqbfuo02E.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"616c9791136545002cc51408","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10231,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Florian Hoffmeister","original_name":"Florian Hoffmeister","popularity":0.1333,"profile_path":"/dcU260q4gxPG3JWu5AfpxsNwXIR.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"616c9795894ed60042f3a664","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":466,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David M.
