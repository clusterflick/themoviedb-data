Featuring interviews with MCs, label operators, producers and bookers, the film focuses on a range of genre-defying international artists such as Ceschi, Noah23, Babel Fishh, Th’ Mole, Gonjasufi, Robot Koch, Comfort Fit, Fulgeance, Oskar Ohlson, and more, many of whom collaborate within networks across the US, Canada, the UK, Germany, Switzerland and Austria.  Working with a very limited budget, the film attempts to provide an insight into the alternative hip hop scene, exploring the creative spirit and DIY punk attitude of the movement.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lFwVQrWv4wibsDrmnxFIkhoEWMY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The otherground connection","title":"Left Fields","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1616932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noah23","original_name":"Noah23","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"572f7d3792514102ac0001f5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1616933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ceschi Ramos","original_name":"Ceschi Ramos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"572f7d429251415cc10024af","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1616934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gonjasufi","original_name":"Gonjasufi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"572f7d51c3a3684db4000253","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1616935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Th' Mole","original_name":"Th' Mole","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"572f7d6092514102720001f0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1616936,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robot Koch","original_name":"Robot Koch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"572f7d7c92514108a900014e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1616937,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fulgeance","original_name":"Fulgeance","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"572f7d8ac3a3687cc90012b5","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1616938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kay the Aquanaut","original_name":"Kay the Aquanaut","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"572f7e489251410272000228","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1616939,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Onry Ozzborn","original_name":"Onry Ozzborn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"572f7e66c3a3682f5b000cb7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1616940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Zavala","original_name":"Alex Zavala","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"572f7e73c3a3684db40002a1","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1616941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James P Honey","original_name":"JamesPHoney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"572f7e83c3a368496e001769","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1616942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oskar Ohlson","original_name":"Oskar Ohlson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"572f7e93c3a3684db40002b1","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1616930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jörg Stefke","original_name":"Jörg Stefke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"572f7d1c92514118d3001d20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1616931,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland Svoboda","original_name":"Roland Svoboda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"572f7d29c3a3687cc90012a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2338059","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lFwVQrWv4wibsDrmnxFIkhoEWMY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":871,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/25wHOzAHfee3jILtm7i3OWx8bf0.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":580}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Schikaneder, Margaretenstraße 24, Vienna","release_date":"2011-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"\"LEFT FIELDS\" - Documentary (2011)","key":"yAHNs8O9yPQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-12-13T21:40:07.000Z","id":"66d34babde7b8414a9ae0b91"}]}}}
