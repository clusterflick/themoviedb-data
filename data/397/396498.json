The movie also lingers on the contamination caused by the corrupting Western society. Nice exotic and harmless 60s mondo movie with some great visuals. Urban clumsiness is also widely documented: slums with pimps, whores, poverty.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1961-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malesia Magica","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1613213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lionetto Fabbri","original_name":"Lionetto Fabbri","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"572e7899c3a3681bee0000f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0291323","wikidata_id":"Q21186415","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1961-05-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
