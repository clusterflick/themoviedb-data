At the end of the film, the athletes expressed their hopes of being \"a step away\" from the 1980 Olympics Games; however, these hopes were shattered by the political crisis and the eventual USA-led boycott to the Olympic Games held in Moscow in 1980.","popularity":0.3584,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sandino
