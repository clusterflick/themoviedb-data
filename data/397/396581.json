It's at this time that he adopts a mantra of viewing an incident before writing a newspaper editorial on it. Several years later he once again visits Korea as a war correspondent during the Korean War and takes home with him several more memories that have a great effect upon him as well. Years later he becomes a respected writer and while giving a speech on the Juche system has his perspective challenged by a young man in the auditorium. Having never seen North Korea he realizes that in order to meet his own high standard of journalism he must travel there and see for himself whether his opinion is valid or not.","popularity":0.121,"poster_path":"/6QnFxWVeiYVzeDT1i2Q6MCeHGzn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Country I Saw","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KP","title":"The Country I Saw - Part 1","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KP","title":"내가 본 나라 1","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pak Ki Ju","original_name":"Pak Ki Ju","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Takahashi Minoru","credit_id":"5730c64cc3a36819af00007b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Ryang Rim","original_name":"Kim Ryang Rim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Ryu Chon Song","credit_id":"5730c663c3a36819af000084","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Chong-hwa","original_name":"Kim Chong-hwa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"57a7c6a9925141544d000b09","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1663070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yi Yŏng-ho","original_name":"Yi Yŏng-ho","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"57a7c6b4925141544d000b10","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1076615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Choi Eun-hee","original_name":"최은희","popularity":0.2345,"profile_path":"/8IfgRUrrrebt7EqUKiBsU6TvaQA.jpg","credit_id":"60c4c55118864b00588576c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shin Sang-ok","original_name":"신상옥","popularity":0.2136,"profile_path":"/z4u9xaPaSHPyoneOL1kXaxyfu1R.jpg","credit_id":"60c4c565a284eb0040688d85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4946510","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6QnFxWVeiYVzeDT1i2Q6MCeHGzn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":529}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
