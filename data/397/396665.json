Long before that Doctor Bartolo took responsibility for Omar, an 18-year-old Tunisian who stranded on Lampedusa's coast. Dr Bartolo offers Omar a family, a home and a job as an interpreter in the local detention centre. Around the same time also Adam, a 16-year-old from Ghana, is taken in by a hotelkeeper, who gives him a job as the hotel's valet. Both boys have been lucky. Or haven't they? Because a future is more than a roof above your head. And good intentions don't suffice for true integration. We should at least listen to the boys themselves. Lampedusa: promised land or prison in the Mediterranean Sea? These 2 unique adoption stories reveal the search for freedom and happiness of both the Lampedusiani and the newcomers, and are a metaphor for the task that awaits the European continent.","popularity":0.1724,"poster_path":"/yNFGX23TjiiytIUPJrg7ptSJlve.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2016-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Akan","iso_639_1":"ak","name":""},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Man Is an Island","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1617282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim De Keersmaecker","original_name":"Tim De Keersmaecker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5730718592514122770017ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617283,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anna Luyten","original_name":"Anna Luyten","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57307190c3a3682f5b00365f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1617282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim De Keersmaecker","original_name":"Tim De Keersmaecker","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573071c09251413bd9004392","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617285,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Emmy Oost","original_name":"Emmy Oost","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573071dc92514102720031fb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1617284,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Samuel Feller","original_name":"Samuel Feller","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573071cfc3a3685879000454","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1427506,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Renaat Lambeets","original_name":"Renaat Lambeets","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660fd7905f4b73017dd59bcb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1788542,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pedro van der Eecken","original_name":"Pedro van der Eecken","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660fd7a93f8ede017ce39a63","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1614930,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Laurens De Geyter","original_name":"Laurens De Geyter","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660fd78774d6c0017cd98ec0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1534671,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Koen Timmerman","original_name":"Koen Timmerman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660fd79fd48cee019fbdc519","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1231485,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Rik Zang","original_name":"Rik Zang","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"671521d699f22f326aad9174","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5133950","wikidata_id":"Q26833832","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":850,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yNFGX23TjiiytIUPJrg7ptSJlve.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":607},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mFhEVydfwBhiUCSASgbyWqD9bK8.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
