Jabe measures 6ft 2inches (188cm), works as a dominatrix and lives on the margins, defying society's expectations of the 'normal' 'feminine' body and sexuality. Jabe Babe also has a life threatening genetic condition called Marfan Syndrome, a connective tissue disorder which affects one in three thousand people. This hybrid documentary film, merging fiction and non-fiction forms, inhabits the heightened technicolour world of the tall woman, the outsider, to boldly provoke questions on society's desire for sexual, visual, and genetic conformity.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jabe Babe: A Heightened Life","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1616799,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janet Merewether","original_name":"Janet Merewether","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"572f176bc3a3682f5b000091","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0482362","wikidata_id":"Q6110082","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
