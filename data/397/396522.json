He knows what it's like. He's been there before... In Australia's Northern Territory three-quarters of the people behind bars are Indigenous men. Lonely Boy Richard is an intimate account of one man's journey to jail. In Richard's home of Yirrkala, like elsewhere, alcohol abuse and violence are threatening family and community life.
