The fresh bloom of friendship that the new neighbor offers impacts the relative calm of their world. Yet, the Japanese woman - with an expiring visa - has her own demons to face. The story explores synchronicity and the fragile ties that bind us to certain people and certain junctures of our lives.","popularity":0.0931,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Willie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1615196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Black","original_name":"Charles Black","popularity":0.1745,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Arthur","credit_id":"5729fa43c3a3680307001c4f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deborah Duke","original_name":"Deborah Duke","popularity":0.0685,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Willie-Mae","credit_id":"5729fe7a9251415d67002903","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1615192,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elmer Bowman","original_name":"Elmer Bowman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5729f72e9251412a95001bea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1615192,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elmer Bowman","original_name":"Elmer Bowman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5729f739c3a3682aa60013e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1570483","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
