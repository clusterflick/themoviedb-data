In REVOLUTION, Margaret tackles the axis of evil, her travels through Thailand's red light district, the explosion of child birth, bartering sex for household chores, revolutionizing one's self-esteem, the joy of bodily functions, her loser ex-boyfriend, and of course, her now world-famous mother. Known as much for her social activism as she is for her raunchy humor, Margaret is a one-of-a-kind phenomenon who once again brings her distinctive and empowering personal voice to her devoted and adoring fans.","popularity":0.391,"poster_path":"/b13GW7OwOFSICi4hbBTG0xpfQlo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Margaret Cho: CHO Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"CHO Revolution","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Margaret Cho: Revolution","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Cho","original_name":"Margaret Cho","popularity":0.6904,"profile_path":"/lsHpa4aRrBMn7LtFX8AdPTFBMGY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe456cc3a368484e05a11d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":566154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Daniels","original_name":"Bruce Daniels","popularity":0.052,"profile_path":"/zEefpZ8kfjXEm9ybZ5VENwsznvS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe456cc3a368484e05a12d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":99242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorene Machado","original_name":"Lorene Machado","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe456cc3a368484e05a123","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Cho","original_name":"Margaret Cho","popularity":0.6904,"profile_path":"/lsHpa4aRrBMn7LtFX8AdPTFBMGY.jpg","credit_id":"52fe456cc3a368484e05a129","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0404844","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pIt6FWBglWBGrJn7y23gDSCHHip.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b13GW7OwOFSICi4hbBTG0xpfQlo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
