Psychics Alexander Stewart and Bernadette Fieldstone are contacted to try to uncover the secrets hidden within her home. What they experience is more than a mere haunting. They come to understand that reality is far more horrifying than fiction. What makes this ghost story unique is that it is based on a true story. In 2001 the two psychics investigated an old western New Jersey farmhouse. So powerful were the images they captured on film, a British television production company met with Angela Webb to do a television special at her house! The story IS factual; the conclusion is shocking.","popularity":0.2323,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ghosts of Angela Webb","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deana Enoches","original_name":"Deana Enoches","popularity":0.1827,"profile_path":"/m166r34rynFsBCYdMXYJybTadJ0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Angela Webb","credit_id":"52fe4567c3a368484e0586c7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Debbie D","original_name":"Debbie D","popularity":0.5512,"profile_path":"/69or5k3y3RUvtCCWbWts5mqgdF8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ghost","credit_id":"52fe4567c3a368484e0586cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael R.
