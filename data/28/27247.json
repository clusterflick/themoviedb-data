One of the finest songwriters of the 20th century is well showcased on this DVD. The Red Piano's set list features some of Sir Elton John's best-known crowd pleasers and he delivers each performance with gusto. One can't help but get enraptured by his enthusiasm, and I found myself tapping my toes to a few tunes that I wouldn't even count among my favorites, ie: Benny and the Jets. There's something about seeing the songss performed live that makes them that much more engaging. Vocally, Elton is in excellent form, and though he modifies a few melodies (he doesn't hit the high notes like he used to - he leaves that to his back-up vocalists), his voice sounds rich and full.","popularity":0.4532,"poster_path":"/96sbYZ1bG5LAcgEB5kH49Eo7u6i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elton John: The Red Piano","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elton John","original_name":"Elton John","popularity":0.9181,"profile_path":"/9G3k29OWPyZtScEDZEAsFJpqiM7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4537c3a368484e04e86f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Mahon","original_name":"John Mahon","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Percussion, Vocals","credit_id":"61381f0a0b731600430a6796","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0494223","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":787,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hZ0ZGfxAAPOqGGRAJ4SMHt2yAQf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/96sbYZ1bG5LAcgEB5kH49Eo7u6i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bdao9uGvTQcbM0GPWOt6tIRvYGS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Elton John - trailer concert The Red Piano","key":"VeAiY7MwHvk","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2009-09-26T14:33:55.000Z","id":"62c0e2f539b6c3005b3e0535"}]}}}
