The group that stages battles performs it at a completely fictional location. However, this hobby is not to the liking of France's wife Marija (Silva Čušin) and his daughter Mateja (Anja Drnovšek).

France is also confronted by the Slovenian police led by the commander Brane (Dario Varga) as Brane forbids France to stage any more battles ...
