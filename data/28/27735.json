It takes an extended visit from Ibou's sister Khadi for Ben to realize that cynicism may be all a matter of perspective.","popularity":2.5511,"poster_path":"/30uwX2GkaHdB6sPcG0b2RUWb2KF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3916,"logo_path":"/noNtRpiSEx5XUfhWbhr74MiXXn9.png","name":"Cold Iron Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14406,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ambush Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":6715,"logo_path":"/kNyEYxlgAS5scvgGrUZ9yeLdD6y.png","name":"K5 International","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":7374,"logo_path":null,"name":"Back Lot Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Happiness is a state of mind","title":"Wonderful World","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":47,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Wonderful World","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"精彩世界","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4756,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Broderick","original_name":"Matthew Broderick","popularity":1.6362,"profile_path":"/8jO89WNvQRTFUrgXuIGOiTRwbYg.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ben Singer","credit_id":"52fe4563c3a368484e05772d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sanaa Lathan","original_name":"Sanaa Lathan","popularity":2.4841,"profile_path":"/wGMgl4eV0hcWpW0mpYmlzgCI7QX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Khadi","credit_id":"52fe4563c3a368484e057731","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Kenneth Williams","original_name":"Michael Kenneth Williams","popularity":0.8025,"profile_path":"/kQCO55YZsQGuE4b8ukRsCMqrREh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ibu","credit_id":"52fe4563c3a368484e057735","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Baker Hall","original_name":"Philip Baker Hall","popularity":0.6472,"profile_path":"/ef7M9soBIv6iGnGEiCdsQ6ppjFl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"The Man","credit_id":"5ee3b20d197de40022919034","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":204815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesse Tyler Ferguson","original_name":"Jesse Tyler Ferguson","popularity":0.6178,"profile_path":"/zeWJZZrCtzUZqyOxOQB4xzuSup1.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Cyril","credit_id":"5ee3bf0a59008600204f65df","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jodelle Ferland","original_name":"Jodelle Ferland","popularity":0.984,"profile_path":"/5N83sI2aDqnvcxIXsoXk0kBUwDz.jpg","cast_id":26,"character":"Sandra","credit_id":"5ee3bf1d4e6742001e53783e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ally Walker","original_name":"Ally Walker","popularity":0.9709,"profile_path":"/kuR6HUF1D0Xk5o5nShgWDBMV2gx.jpg","cast_id":27,"character":"Eliza","credit_id":"5ee3bf25197de4001f90cac9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":139248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mia Ford","original_name":"Mia Ford","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":"/dQbtBms1EH6isnmLu5myTK6ztaa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Maxine -
