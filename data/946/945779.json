Born near the Calanques, he could have been a sailor, like him linked to storms and the stars. We follow him with Edwin Mattews (USA) in their ascent of the Barre des Ecrins, then in La Meije. Accompanied by Jean Juge (Switzerland), in the Mont Blanc Massif, for a crossing of the Aiguilles de Chamonix. With his Italian friend Lino Donvito, he climbs the Torre de Vijolet in the Dolomites. Then with Massulu Suzuki (Japan) in the Mont Blanc massif (Rochefort ridges, Dent du Géant via the south face). Christian Ringeval (France) accompanies him for an ascent of Vignemale. And finally return to the Mont Blanc massif, to the Grand Capucin (Bonatti route) with Konrad Krirch.","popularity":0.4108,"poster_path":"/dqMQy6PpnmEJIhmYK4SQcgGmrG8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Horizons Gagnés","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1921578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaston Rébuffat","original_name":"Gaston Rébuffat","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/szk0m7tvLXDMcXrwI4fEFrfFYX0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6221e29feea34d0043057fd9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Konrad Kirch","original_name":"Konrad Kirch","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64bdaaa458efd300ace2354b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lino Donvito","original_name":"Lino Donvito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64bdaad1b865eb00ada0d218","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin Matthews","original_name":"Edwin Matthews","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64bdaaf70ed2ab00ff871c6a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Ringeval","original_name":"Christian Ringeval","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64bdab01c390c5013c533cac","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4176846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Massulu Suzuki","original_name":"Massulu Suzuki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64bdab0c85c0a200e78601b3","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1921578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaston Rébuffat","original_name":"Gaston Rébuffat","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/szk0m7tvLXDMcXrwI4fEFrfFYX0.jpg","credit_id":"6221dfcb41aac4001b3b3f91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1921578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gaston Rébuffat","original_name":"Gaston Rébuffat","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/szk0m7tvLXDMcXrwI4fEFrfFYX0.jpg","credit_id":"64bda8c5e9da69014fec20be","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yPFmagYqhdq5LXmGlGQLvCGUERH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dqMQy6PpnmEJIhmYK4SQcgGmrG8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xKQn65b1Nb5YUOZDzccZkdYSQtU.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lOHTF6ME7Jiane96EtBCaXI9YP0.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":155622,"name":"pyrenees mountain ridge"},{"id":159212,"name":"mountain climbing"},{"id":160175,"name":"alps mountains"},{"id":160177,"name":"mountaineering"},{"id":215368,"name":"chamonix"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":299660,"name":"adventure pionner"},{"id":320873,"name":"gaston rebuffat"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
