In those mountains, and in the cold winter under feet of snow, the snow masses that accumulate on the tree fall and roll down the mountain. When they reach the bottom, the masses divide into three balls and form a snowman. The snowman befriends the girl in the house at the foot of the mountain. They enjoy the cold, starry night before nature does its last.","popularity":0.0379,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3284936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Issam Taachit","original_name":"Issam Taachit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62208c8c41aac40044e893a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"digital streaming end","release_date":"2022-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"digital streaming start","release_date":"2022-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
