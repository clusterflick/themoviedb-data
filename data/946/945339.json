He was old and peevish, and so racked and crippled by illness that he could not walk a step. The woman declared that something must be done and on numerous occasions pleaded with her husband to send the old man to the poor house. The farmer long, resisted, but at last he yielded and the woman drove away triumphantly, to make her arrangements at the alms house. The old man knew what was contemplated. Helpless and friendless he sat in his chair, and prayed for death. Who could blame him? The wife, as has been stated, was on her way to the alms house.","popularity":0.0752,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"While Baby Slept","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riley Chamberlin","original_name":"Riley Chamberlin","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/rP8UIEIXirhNcKWRK1gZ6rFRq0V.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Grandfather","credit_id":"621ff2058a88b20045851366","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Russell","original_name":"William Russell","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/aX8jIPumedzNkhgtrCo02XmQtiu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Husband","credit_id":"621ff21441aac4001b347cc4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1157005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite Snow","original_name":"Marguerite Snow","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/tm1mSAwwNnFh7pjPUaz1Hfg2lEc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Wife","credit_id":"621ff222058224006c4755dd","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174217,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lloyd Lonergan","original_name":"Lloyd Lonergan","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/yUXJjlZsPNSpFPtbrEWVKw9vloX.jpg","credit_id":"621ff1f041aac4006c6d7477","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1174217,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lloyd Lonergan","original_name":"Lloyd Lonergan","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/yUXJjlZsPNSpFPtbrEWVKw9vloX.jpg","credit_id":"621ff1f442bf01006f95b4e2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0496889","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
