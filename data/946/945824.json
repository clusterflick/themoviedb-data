Forced out of their home and ancestral village, buffeted by winds of hate, running for their lives, scattered like human debris in relief camps. Never able to return. How do they rebuild new homes and new lives, with hearts unable to leave the old one behind? This film is about survivors of Muzaffarnagar, a town in north India, where targetted violence in 2013 forced over 60,000 people to flee their homes in fear. Many could never return. An estimated 60 people were killed, and 40 more died later in the relief camps - mostly children who perished from cold and sickness in a bitter winter. The Colour of My Home is about rebuilding broken lives. It is about the scars that hate and violence leave on the human soul. It is about memory and loss. It is also about the spirit to survive.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/j5GCM3SRs4YuWWsCt6Eygb1udVI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Colour of My Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"The colour of my house","type":"english"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"ye mera ghar","type":"hindi"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3452141,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Farah Naqvi","original_name":"Farah Naqvi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622219e399259c0043542360","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3452142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sanjay Barnela","original_name":"Sanjay Barnela","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622219f4902012006d4c72a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8364244","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5KrL5fdzhdmc0E0V29vaJmyJ78k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1423}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j5GCM3SRs4YuWWsCt6Eygb1udVI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":533}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Colour of My Home","key":"FJ0zWug3_O0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-17T15:28:12.000Z","id":"62221651c2823a00421785fe"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Colour of My Home: Trailer","key":"O7tgqhQnu64","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2017-07-11T09:38:41.000Z","id":"622216b641aac4001b3bb901"}]}}}
