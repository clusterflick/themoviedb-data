A university student with the unusual name of Takanashi (小鳥遊). He has always been a soft-spoken person, but when he is strongly criticised by others, he has a strange disease that causes him to suddenly fall asleep. Today, he works part-time as a road construction worker, causing trouble, but he falls in love at first sight with a rollerblader who passes by. He is happy to see her again by chance, but in a strange turn of events, he is misunderstood and falls asleep. When he wakes up, he sets off to express his feelings. At the same time, she also starts running to find him...  A sensitive and timid young man steps out into the outside world for the first time. Regardless of the outcome, the preciousness of the act itself is lightly conveyed in a spare, lean film.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/maP4xGaWmlgDgH1aLeoRb2RPGk3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"世界が静寂だったらいい","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3450091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miura Ko","original_name":"Miura Ko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"621fc5269f1be7006b8540a8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3450092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yamamoto Hajime","original_name":"Yamamoto Hajime","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"621fc52c6c449c001d3304c8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3450093,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masuda Kiyotake","original_name":"Masuda Kiyotake","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"621fc5326f43ec00446b99af","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3450094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazanashi Yukari","original_name":"Kazanashi Yukari","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"621fc5386c449c00450cbe6a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3450095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kawashima Naoki","original_name":"Kawashima Naoki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"621fc53f7719d7006da316e6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3450101,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sachi Ikegawa","original_name":"Sachi Ikegawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621fc58441aac4006c6ccdca","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3450102,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Takahiro Ishizuka","original_name":"Takahiro Ishizuka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621fc58c6f43ec00446b9b24","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3160875,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Masato Tamura","original_name":"Masato Tamura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621fc577e194b0001b73f40a","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3450090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshishi Ogasawara","original_name":"Yoshishi Ogasawara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621fc50be194b00044453ec6","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3450098,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Katsuaki Takahashi","original_name":"Katsuaki Takahashi","popularity":0.0675,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621fc557f706de006d685a4d","department":"Art","job":"Assistant Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3450103,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kaoru Sato","original_name":"Kaoru Sato","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621fc5a16b5fc2001b6f6883","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3450091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miura Ko","original_name":"Miura Ko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621fc59638e5100020a08bdd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3450090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yoshishi Ogasawara","original_name":"Yoshishi Ogasawara","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621fc5036f43ec006d51ba11","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/maP4xGaWmlgDgH1aLeoRb2RPGk3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
