Unbeknownst to them and with the shopâ€™s manicurist in tow they run into their customer again who is a crooked gambler winning his money by questionable methods. As he rakes in the pots, an assistant pours the money down a chute which leads to a vault. Billy and Andy, in their explorations, find this vault and think they have discovered a mine. Taking some of the money, they go to the gambler's room and sit in the game. Thus, the money continues to circulate - from the mine to Billy - from Billy to the gambler - and down the chute again.","popularity":0.6025,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":22520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mack Sennett Comedies","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trimmed in Gold","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100763,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Bevan","original_name":"Billy Bevan","popularity":0.2282,"profile_path":"/5yAbj9GLj7RfcMEFo3A20eOAIGU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Otto Stropp","credit_id":"62215687dd83fa004a6a1a90","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Clyde","original_name":"Andy Clyde","popularity":0.2349,"profile_path":"/a2HSCnMfIpLnLCNr6r4gWM8zR6K.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hector Moss","credit_id":"62215694001bbd006cb31cf4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1092778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeline Hurlock","original_name":"Madeline Hurlock","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":"/x9K1qEmd90gcJuyoMIJyqoZrkBg.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Nina Hart","credit_id":"622156a2e16e5a006ed8020d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kewpie Morgan","original_name":"Kewpie Morgan","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":"/vev7Ak06wmKc4kx4Jpsjy5xVRUJ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Cactus Cal","credit_id":"622156b0f706de0043d1f337","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30530,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irving Bacon","original_name":"Irving Bacon","popularity":0.3488,"profile_path":"/oFczw1DlGJ2p1wr4osdC2flX9qN.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Barber","credit_id":"622156da41aac40044eb1767","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tiny Ward","original_name":"Tiny Ward","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/p5zXLSti6DoMfhoMyKLDJjZ3Js9.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Cal's Henchman","credit_id":"622156bddd83fa004a6a1bd2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1144349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Moore","original_name":"Roger Moore","popularity":0.2084,"profile_path":"/DUAWbhloHHlPLLVSLEN79Na8E2.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Sheriff","credit_id":"622156ea902012006d4a2b9c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1380110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion McDonald","original_name":"Marion McDonald","popularity":0.0594,"profile_path":"/4tw1eqflXeSvfh6V9vvcWgVKdjF.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Minor Role (uncredited)","credit_id":"622156ff84591c004483b219","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":199922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Donnelly","original_name":"James Donnelly","popularity":0.0663,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Barber Shop Boss","credit_id":"622156ccc2ff3d006f970de0","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Del Lord","original_name":"Del Lord","popularity":0.2773,"profile_path":"/zGGlVrOKtnNXn9yxKMYkGY1yBMg.jpg","credit_id":"622156629f1be7006b8ae16c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1150485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jefferson Moffitt","original_name":"Jefferson Moffitt","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6221566c6f43ec0044713c8a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":148526,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vernon Smith","original_name":"Vernon Smith","popularity":0.0949,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6221567838e5100020a5fbbc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89518,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mack Sennett","original_name":"Mack Sennett","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/24XTSL0AbuT6gzjqAFhpc4fkEts.jpg","credit_id":"66db242cf2fe3add69963386","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0016454","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1926-02-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
