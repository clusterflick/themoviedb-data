A man with a Super 8 camera films his route, the villagers and himself. Portraits, self-portrait. As the images unfold a young villager, Josse, is intrigued by the camera’s presence. For the cameraman the lens is an eye with which one films reality, for the villager the camera represents CINEMA, the magic of fiction. Josse accosts the cameraman and leads him across the fields where his girlfriend joins them. The outing becomes their production, with themselves in front of the camera. Games. Gradually diverted by Josse’s enthousiasme the film slides into moments of fiction, until its inevitable breakdown.","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":"/4nKvh0IA1jTx5Hk5gn9btzj4wzb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1065356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Pauwels","original_name":"Eric Pauwels","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":"/eYHwWVHhgOyYfFKVlZOHqfNK9Tp.jpg","credit_id":"62218395dd83fa00219344eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4nKvh0IA1jTx5Hk5gn9btzj4wzb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":764}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1986-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
