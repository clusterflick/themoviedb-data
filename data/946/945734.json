Parents share emotional stories of their children's struggles with reading, writing, and spelling and the impact the word dyslexia had on their lives. Adult dyslexics speak candidly of the struggles and successes they had in school. And experts define what dyslexia is and illustrate how effective tutoring, classroom accommodations, and recognizing and fostering the natural strengths of a child with dyslexia can take them from feeling stupid and experiencing failure on a daily basis to believing in themselves and knowing that they can be successful.","popularity":1.3153,"poster_path":"/j3abKGR0MTkCbIWqCgHkQq9coKh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171067,"logo_path":null,"name":"Learning Foundations","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Embracing Dyslexia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3454321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cornell Amerson","original_name":"Cornell Amerson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"62242060278d8a004356bd91","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3454329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liz Barnes","original_name":"Liz Barnes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"self","credit_id":"62242276c3bffe00445f3a4b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3454336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maryanne Wolf","original_name":"Maryanne Wolf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"self","credit_id":"6224237b363909001bc660ba","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3454318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Macias","original_name":"Luis Macias","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62241fab72d8550066c98699","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3454319,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Barton","original_name":"Susan Barton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62241fef7d55040045dd7828","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3454328,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Ferguson","original_name":"Michael Ferguson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6224224f25b9550064c61e5b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3454318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luis Macias","original_name":"Luis Macias","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62242335278d8a006db6520f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3454338,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cynthia Dapello","original_name":"Cynthia Dapello","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622423a5d1ca2a00443514fa","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3454343,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Daniel Stevens","original_name":"Daniel Stevens","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62242488278d8a006db65970","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3120236","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":""},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1481,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j3abKGR0MTkCbIWqCgHkQq9coKh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7919,"name":"dyslexia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Embracing Dyslexia trailer","key":"Vy5WxLf-r6g","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-09-03T21:09:20.000Z","id":"6224271d72d855001b68dfb6"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Embracing Dyslexia","key":"cBIK0XVPbXo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2013-09-02T05:01:12.000Z","id":"62242102e6d3cc001b90bc77"}]}}}
