It’s about how writers age, their jealousies, resentments, and regrets, why they can’t revisit their old glories, and how their writing can overwhelm their life. Shakespeare has sacrificed much of his family life for his theatrical success and now—haunted with guilt about missing his young son’s death to the plague—he is forced to reflect on the price at which glory comes.","popularity":0.4837,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":171006,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silver Spring Road Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rough Magic: Exit Shakespeare","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Amendola","original_name":"Tony Amendola","popularity":0.8826,"profile_path":"/eGgQGEwO2vCqhFcmDfyyjctmWcl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"William Shakespeare","credit_id":"622248587719d70044fe2e88","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115447,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Wolk","original_name":"Andy Wolk","popularity":0.3003,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6222488374d6c00044103f6f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3042208,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Handy","original_name":"Matt Handy","popularity":0.0701,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622248a5eea34d0068095a68","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115447,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Wolk","original_name":"Andy Wolk","popularity":0.3003,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6222486a8741c4001b2e8c62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3452443,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elliot Krieger","original_name":"Elliot Krieger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622248935a07f50044e421c6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
