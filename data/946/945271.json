A boy who feels uncomfortable in his surroundings because of his 1/4 black blood and cannot help thinking about his identity. A girl who has not yet had her first menstruation at the age of 20 and is frustrated by the insensitivity of the world. The boy turns the camera on the young man to find out 'what it means to be Japanese' and asks him 'what he is thinking about now'. The girl clashes with the actors as she tries to make a film with a woman she admires as the protagonist. In the process of fighting both inside and outside herself, the two meet by chance with a camera in hand.  The film depicts the two people, each with their own 'blood-sun problem', reaching an answer through pain, comfort and other previously unknown methods, without haste and with gentleness.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/95LNkKWWmL7IynzT2BJugsuRBx6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hinomaru Graffiti","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451267,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kusabun Kozue","original_name":"Kusabun Kozue","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62210ea1dd83fa004a690728","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451266,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dazzle (Sekine Yugo)","original_name":"Dazzle (Sekine Yugo)","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62210ea7902012006d49238a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MGABrothers","original_name":"MGABrothers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62210eaef706de0043d0eb0a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"MGBSBrothers","original_name":"MGBSBrothers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62210eb46f43ec006d569675","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Makoto Matsumoto","original_name":"Makoto Matsumoto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210e65c2ff3d001bed7fec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451266,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dazzle (Sekine Yugo)","original_name":"Dazzle (Sekine Yugo)","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210e957719d7001d77cfbe","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Makoto Matsumoto","original_name":"Makoto Matsumoto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210e6aeea34d0068056df4","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Makoto Matsumoto","original_name":"Makoto Matsumoto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210e6ff706de001b46334b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451264,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Makoto Matsumoto","original_name":"Makoto Matsumoto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210e799f1be7006b89d7eb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/95LNkKWWmL7IynzT2BJugsuRBx6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
