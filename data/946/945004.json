They wanted to get back to New York, but even though they sold all their wardrobe they could only arrange sufficient funds to pay for one ticket. The woman, however, had an inspiration: the railroad company carried baggage free. The thespians had no baggage, therefore she decided to ship her husband in a Saratoga trunk in the baggage car ahead. He consented to the plan. The plan was marvelously successful, and the husband was trundled aboard the train, without arousing any suspicion. His wife found new troubles, however, for the heartless conductor refused to let her take her little pet dog into the passenger car.","popularity":0.1099,"poster_path":"/7I4Ee1dRuLtlr9jZNYjXfDNidV0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dog in the Baggage Car","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Cruze","original_name":"James Cruze","popularity":0.2053,"profile_path":"/rTDilm5WrU4I8n4abBUucJGoAkY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Actor","credit_id":"621eb57b8a88b2004580cb7e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1157005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite Snow","original_name":"Marguerite Snow","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/tm1mSAwwNnFh7pjPUaz1Hfg2lEc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Actor's Wife","credit_id":"621eb58df12cf4006c312987","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0495994","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7I4Ee1dRuLtlr9jZNYjXfDNidV0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
