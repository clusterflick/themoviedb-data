She had read many books and from them had gained the idea that she would be far happier as a simple peasant than as the daughter of a king. Even when it came to her marriage, she sadly reflected, there was no romance, for her father had arbitrarily contracted an alliance for her with a neighboring prince. The princess was taking her drive one day and was sadder than ever. She saw a wedding procession issue from a neighboring cottage, and pityingly watched the mother of the bride, as she turned into her lonely house. In a field the princess noticed a young farmer, and she thought that the romance which had been denied her might come into her life. By the time she had returned to the castle she was pitying herself exceedingly, and had decided to be a caged bird no longer.","popularity":0.1522,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Caged Bird","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1157005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite Snow","original_name":"Marguerite Snow","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/tm1mSAwwNnFh7pjPUaz1Hfg2lEc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Princess","credit_id":"621ff126001bbd00435b2a4f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120818,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Garwood","original_name":"William Garwood","popularity":0.1989,"profile_path":"/sFq3FeCnxyEbbNkfnueRbZLDyD8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Prince","credit_id":"621ff13377b1fb0045c76433","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Cruze","original_name":"James Cruze","popularity":0.2053,"profile_path":"/rTDilm5WrU4I8n4abBUucJGoAkY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The King","credit_id":"621ff1419f1be7001b17fe34","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1168631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Russell","original_name":"William Russell","popularity":0.125,"profile_path":"/aX8jIPumedzNkhgtrCo02XmQtiu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Farmer","credit_id":"621ff152e194b0004445f1de","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3450251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma C.
