Musty seems to be the sole employee about the place, and whatever is called for by any of the patrons, he has to supply it. He is placed in charge of the cane rack, and of course, cheats so that the customers get no canes. One irascible old fellow complains to the manager, who upbraids Musty for his dishonesty.
