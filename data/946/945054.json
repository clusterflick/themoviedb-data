The Wrecking Crew were a group of in-demand Los Angeles studio musicians who played on hundreds of iconic hits, including the Beach Boys' \"Help Me, Rhonda\" and The Mamas and The Papas' \"California Dreamin'.\" Many different musicians played as part of the loosely organized Wrecking Crew, but there were three mainstays: drummer Hal Blaine, guitarist Tommy Tedesco, and guitarist and bassist Carol Kaye. Kaye was one of the few females working session musicians of the era. According to Vulture, both The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson and super producer Quincy Jones have referred to her as the greatest bassist in the world.Â ","popularity":0.0443,"poster_path":"/6SvFODH05ZAoorjLzuahGi8Nk7U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170880,"logo_path":null,"name":"Snapshots Music and Arts Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carol Kaye: Pioneer and Session Legend","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1490040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carol Kaye","original_name":"Carol Kaye","popularity":0.1511,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"621ed80e77b1fb001e16f455","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3449243,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bruce Huntington","original_name":"Bruce Huntington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621ed83c058224004293f71e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3449243,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bruce Huntington","original_name":"Bruce Huntington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621ed84b8c7b0f004360e53a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3449243,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bruce Huntington","original_name":"Bruce Huntington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621ed82f7719d7006da053a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2890068","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6SvFODH05ZAoorjLzuahGi8Nk7U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
