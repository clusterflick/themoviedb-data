The film focuses mainly on people who identify as trans and culminates with understanding and discussing the community's take on the recently passed Transgender Persons Bill.  Do you really think you shouldn't speak or laugh loudly? Don't you want to just express your heart out no matter what? Do you really do everything a boy is supposed to do? Do you not break rules everyday being a girl? Isn't gender subjective? Wouldn't world be a better place if we do not confine people into boxes? Isn't it the most natural thing to do? Lets ask questions together and hear the answers from those who are really out there and living the most 'natural' lives.","popularity":0.0517,"poster_path":"/ddhuZqPLI8YnflPe2AWPTZopyuk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171007,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gaash Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boxed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3452444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sameeksha Zia","original_name":"Sameeksha Zia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62224896c2823a0042181f10","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3452445,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sumit Raina","original_name":"Sumit Raina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622248ae5a07f50072f5d5bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ddhuZqPLI8YnflPe2AWPTZopyuk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BOXED | DOCUMENTARY | TRAILER","key":"1PRh002x4Jw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-02-07T06:52:25.000Z","id":"622249cd41aac40044ede6c3"}]}}}
