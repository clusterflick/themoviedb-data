Uemura spends August of his senior year at university looking for a job with bleak prospects. At his lodgings, Tajima, a classmate from junior high school, comes to ask to stay with him for a while. In fact, Tajima has a history of assaults in his hometown and has come to Tokyo to do dangerous work. By chance, Uemura learns of Tajima's criminal record and is also concerned about the late-night phone calls he receives. However, there is nothing he can do, and Tajima himself has no way to turn back, and their summer ends with their mutual caring for each other.  The story is told in a restrained manner, but the same locations and props, such as the basement of the building, the pottery club room and the curry and rice, are used to show the changes in the situation, and the film's storytelling sense shines through.","popularity":0.0402,"poster_path":"/adZIbdLP0wmg7aAPs5eGlKDlfkh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170964,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eisokai","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"夏が終る","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daishi Kobayashi","original_name":"Daishi Kobayashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210cbf41aac4006c71391a","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451243,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Tatsujin Naga","original_name":"Tatsujin Naga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210d0699259c006a7f0094","department":"Art","job":"Location Scout"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daishi Kobayashi","original_name":"Daishi Kobayashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210cb638e5100020a4f921","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451242,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Shinichiro Goto","original_name":"Shinichiro Goto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210cfde16e5a006ed6e9a1","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451240,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daishi Kobayashi","original_name":"Daishi Kobayashi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210cc3e16e5a006ed6e8e7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/adZIbdLP0wmg7aAPs5eGlKDlfkh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
