One day during summer holiday, best friends Nemoto and Maruyama are walking along a mountain path when suddenly a gunshot rings out and Nemoto falls. Maruyama barely manages to hide behind a roadside block, but Nemoto is seriously injured and unable to move. At first Maruyama tries to help, but the persistent and invisible killer frightens him and he is unable to do anything about it. Root begins to blame him, and says that the killer is after you and that he is involved. Time ticks by as the truth remains elusive...  The film depicts the human psyche, where friendship and conscience disappear and only egoism emerges as a result of the absurd horror, set only on an ordinary country road. A film that tackles drama head-on, in a world where many films are bland.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/nPfgvo9wyVGzgXHllghEWzR3Qc6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manatsu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kojo Hayashi","original_name":"Kojo Hayashi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62210eebeea34d004302c357","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yukio Nishiyama","original_name":"Yukio Nishiyama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62210ef141aac40044ea17e5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toshizo Nemoto","original_name":"Toshizo Nemoto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62210ef8902012006d49246e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yoshiaki Ozawa","original_name":"Yoshiaki Ozawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62210f0842bf01001d05a105","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yukio Nishiyama","original_name":"Yukio Nishiyama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210ece6f43ec006d56970c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yukio Nishiyama","original_name":"Yukio Nishiyama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210f1b99259c004350f6f8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yukio Nishiyama","original_name":"Yukio Nishiyama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210ec79f1be7006b89d8ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toshizo Nemoto","original_name":"Toshizo Nemoto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210f37e16e5a006ed6f1e7","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yukio Nishiyama","original_name":"Yukio Nishiyama","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210ee141aac40044ea17be","department":"Crew","job":"Special Effects"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toshizo Nemoto","original_name":"Toshizo Nemoto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210f1242bf01001d05a11a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451285,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daisuke Kawai","original_name":"Daisuke Kawai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210f2de16e5a006ed6f1a8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451283,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kensaku Nishimura","original_name":"Kensaku Nishimura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210f2538e5100073719d25","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nPfgvo9wyVGzgXHllghEWzR3Qc6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
