The protagonist, Wakaizumi, makes films with his university friends, but despite being a director, he has no credibility at all due to his selfish and unprincipled nature. He has no finished films. All they have are rumours that he is a strong fighter and that he has eaten cockroaches. Wakaizumi says he wants reality in his films, but he does not know what reality is. Days seem to be unchanging. But as much as something about him hurts people, something about him attracts them, and the filmmaking continues.  The well-crafted double structure in terms of composition, direction and camerawork goes beyond the framework of a self-proclaimed 'personal history film' and gives us the best of both worlds: fiction and non-fiction.","popularity":0.2094,"poster_path":"/vEr7toojG9WeeiTaHYeQI6Bb7cJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Waseda University Film
