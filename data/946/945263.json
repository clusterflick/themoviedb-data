Shuhei and Midori, two poor siblings without parents, manage to live together in a small apartment but have long been urged by their aunt in Tokyo to move in with them. The younger sister is reluctant, the older brother gives up. A small incident occurs between them that makes them aware of the opposite sex, and their respective summers pass. And the day they leave for Tokyo is the day of a summer festival in the country town where the siblings were born and raised.  The film's direction has the ability to plant the emotions and background of each of them firmly on the screen with everyday movements and straightforward dialogue. The level of acting by the actors is high. It was a summer when we felt cool with barley tea and watermelon instead of air-conditioning. The same nostalgia and vitality are present throughout the film.","popularity":0.0505,"poster_path":"/f54AFTSkBzLeYZUarmPXErMcBwU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"田舎町的朝","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451203,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keiko Mayome","original_name":"Keiko Mayome","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62210a1a9f1be7006b89c860","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360813,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Takano Shinichi","original_name":"Takano Shinichi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"62210a2084591c001bc561ba","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451197,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tomohiro Oto","original_name":"Tomohiro Oto","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"62210a2c84591c0044829df1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Masako Muranaka","original_name":"Masako Muranaka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"62210a31001bbd001bcf1615","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451950,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mitsuru Tanaka","original_name":"Mitsuru Tanaka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"62210a3742bf01006f9974d4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2414505,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Naoyuki Kobayashi","original_name":"Naoyuki Kobayashi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622109b037b3a90043f03e44","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2414505,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Naoyuki Kobayashi","original_name":"Naoyuki Kobayashi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622109bbe16e5a001bded8f2","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451197,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tomohiro Oto","original_name":"Tomohiro Oto","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622109cd6f43ec00447020f4","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3360817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suzuki Tomonori","original_name":"Suzuki Tomonori","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622109d96f43ec006d568532","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451200,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Hironori Masuno","original_name":"Hironori Masuno","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622109ec001bbd006cb20488","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2706317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natsuki Kamata","original_name":"Natsuki Kamata","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622109f9eea34d004302b2be","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Artist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451201,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yosuke Nakamoto","original_name":"Yosuke Nakamoto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210a0242bf0100456da0c6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451202,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mika Hayade","original_name":"Mika Hayade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210a0edd83fa00731e4cde","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f54AFTSkBzLeYZUarmPXErMcBwU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
