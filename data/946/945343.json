The girl was employed by a firm who had offices in one of the tallest of New York's skyscrapers, and her sweetheart saw her there. She took him to her favorite observatory, the roof of the building, where he obtained a magnificent and uninterrupted view of the greatest city in the world. He, on his part, took his sweetheart to the army maneuvers, where she witnessed with delight the well drilled troops, but would not confess that there was one man among them who could not compare with the one of her choice. She was particularly interested in the signal corps, however, and at odd times the sergeant instructed her in the code until she had become fairly proficient in it.","popularity":0.0759,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Top of New York","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94305,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Cruze","original_name":"James Cruze","popularity":0.2053,"profile_path":"/rTDilm5WrU4I8n4abBUucJGoAkY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"The Sergeant","credit_id":"621ff5409f1be700446d6206","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1157005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marguerite Snow","original_name":"Marguerite Snow","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":"/tm1mSAwwNnFh7pjPUaz1Hfg2lEc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Sweetheart","credit_id":"621ff54edd83fa004a65019f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120820,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riley Chamberlin","original_name":"Riley Chamberlin","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":"/rP8UIEIXirhNcKWRK1gZ6rFRq0V.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"An Office Clerk","credit_id":"621ff55e42bf0100456a091d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1342098,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Bauer","original_name":"Arthur Bauer","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"An Office Clerk","credit_id":"621ff56feea34d0068019323","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0496863","wikidata_id":"Q13423569","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
