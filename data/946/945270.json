Hana experiences the worst thing that ever happened to her during her summer holiday when she was 17. She was raped by a man in her class whom she liked. To get the worst revenge on the worst man, she invites Yumi, the coolest person in her class, to join her. The revenge seems successful, but Hana fights back and Yumi stabs the man with a knife in an attempt to save her. The two decide to escape by bicycle. They take turns pedalling their bicycles and arrive at the seaside town Yumi has chosen as her destination. It turns out to be the town where her father lives with his mistress...  Yumi confronts the problems she had not solved by passing through the gate that Hana pulled her through. Hana is touched by Yumi's strength and becomes stronger herself. The film dramatically depicts the girls growing up separately in the same time.","popularity":0.0943,"poster_path":"/z3AHiqW54aLdidFzByTkfcBvE2F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"八月のタンゴ","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tadashi Inoue","original_name":"Tadashi Inoue","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62210da726dac1004331f4ea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiroyoshi Uchida","original_name":"Hiroyoshi Uchida","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62210dac41aac4001b3864f0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toshikazu Araki","original_name":"Toshikazu Araki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62210db137b3a9006da09388","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451256,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sanae Nishida","original_name":"Sanae Nishida","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62210db7c2ff3d001bed7ef2","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1711587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aoi Tatsumi","original_name":"Aoi Tatsumi","popularity":0.0979,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"62210dbe6f43ec0044702f87","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomoka Tachibana","original_name":"Tomoka Tachibana","popularity":0.0421,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"62210dc726dac1001b51ebed","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3286972,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aki Saito","original_name":"Aki Saito","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"62210dd084591c004482aad0","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fumio Okazaki","original_name":"Fumio Okazaki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210d49dd83fa002191808f","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3171406,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Toshihiro Fujiwara","original_name":"Toshihiro Fujiwara","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210d8d41aac40044ea1328","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fumio Okazaki","original_name":"Fumio Okazaki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210d4d99259c006a7f0127","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451250,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Takehiko Kamiya","original_name":"Takehiko Kamiya","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210d98c2ff3d006f95d938","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3451247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fumio Okazaki","original_name":"Fumio Okazaki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62210d3d99259c001b219e64","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z3AHiqW54aLdidFzByTkfcBvE2F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
