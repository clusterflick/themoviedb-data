New to Los Angeles, Mary Tyler (Mary Ryan) takes a job at a mysterious startup called DaJaVue, which begins to warp her reality in strange and unsettling ways. Izabella Watson (Lucy Blehar) is the youngest CEO in America, and her amazing, fantastical yet unproven device, The DaJa, is poised to take over the tech world. Her lapdog assistant, Constance (Brigid Marshall), does everything possible to clear a shining path for Izabella's plans. Mary's roommate, Shelly (Sarah Moliski), balances her new acting gig on a cat-centric web series called Felinious with keeping her best friend's feet on the ground. Meanwhile, her co-worker, Donna (Victoria Allen) raises important questions about the direction and solvency of DaJaVue.","popularity":0.8631,"poster_path":"/xcAOqiFemmMFZAcAbgsmNcgYk7g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":218349,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hybr√§u Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some startups never end","title":"Mary Tyler, Millennial","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":557597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clay Adams","original_name":"Clay Adams","popularity":0.233,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Congressman Jump","credit_id":"65a39583d35dea0128430487","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3482757,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Allen","original_name":"Victoria Allen","popularity":0.0388,"profile_path":"/egWCtREHHjAfW3Lz1jyCCLMcFsY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Donna","credit_id":"65a395a5bc2cb300c0022899","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2082345,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Spencer Beghtol","original_name":"Spencer Beghtol","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Spencer","credit_id":"65a395b7d35dea012e43036f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1893737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Blehar","original_name":"Lucy Blehar","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Izabella Watson","credit_id":"65a395ce1f0275012708a36a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4480417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Blehar","original_name":"Sam Blehar","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"65a39605bc2cb300be0223e2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4480419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Burgess","original_name":"Lauren Burgess","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Alyson","credit_id":"65a3961d39549a012f10af04","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":173783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Carley","original_name":"Kurt Carley","popularity":0.1832,"profile_path":"/dzABei6glTJtubh8Od74KAVLlOX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Zanzibar","credit_id":"65a396342667780128645f71","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2872227,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kiki Lee","original_name":"Kiki Lee","popularity":0.174,"profile_path":"/pFKMnKIG6fWlZiyQfpBuIGEX4yl.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sheera","credit_id":"65a396492973380121133923","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4480423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Coulouris","original_name":"Jackson Coulouris","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jackson","credit_id":"65a3965bbc2cb300c00228c2","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1690886,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Paul Stephen Edwards","original_name":"Paul Stephen Edwards","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Interviewer","credit_id":"65a3966d5690b54a7fb02635","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2613807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Forman","original_name":"Karen Forman","popularity":0.0837,"profile_path":"/nqTJiinG33U1N22TeMrrA5IJchT.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Margaret Q","credit_id":"65a396807d5f4b00c2b7dc0e","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3236142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigid Marshall","original_name":"Brigid Marshall","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Constance","credit_id":"65a396931f0275012708a3a9","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2115393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
