Abducted by a sadistic predator and his wife, she was brainwashed, tortured, and largely confined to a coffin-size box. From the very spot where she was first picked up, Colleen provides a riveting first-hand account. She explains how a slavery contract prevented her from running, and how mind control prevented her from going to police even once she was free. In the second hour learn how Colleen embraces freedom, but no matter how much she wants to move on, the past won't go away. When she eventually took the stand at her abductor's trial, she found herself portrayed as a willing participant. Evil may cast a long shadow, but faith and family ultimately allowed Colleen to reclaim her identity and find her mission.","popularity":0.3061,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colleen Stan: The Girl in the Box","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2017232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Herrera","original_name":"Stephanie Herrera","popularity":0.1803,"profile_path":"/zQ7VPbgp1A2hwZslRo7QXWKFjFS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"621fa3989f1be7006b84aa41","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3449917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Lefevre","original_name":"Greg Lefevre","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"621fa3a1eea34d0043fdbfb4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3449920,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sean Turrell","original_name":"Sean Turrell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621fa3d9e194b0006c08e111","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3449921,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jacqueline Bynon","original_name":"Jacqueline Bynon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621fa3f0902012006d440ce0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1602323,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sharon Zupancic","original_name":"Sharon Zupancic","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621fa404eea34d006800482c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3449922,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kim Bondi","original_name":"Kim Bondi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621fa4106b5fc2001b6ee7d4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2361012,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jacqueline Bynon","original_name":"Jacqueline Bynon","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621fa42477b1fb001e191397","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3449923,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lana Gorlitz","original_name":"Lana Gorlitz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621fa42e77b1fb0045c62027","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3277748,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kevin Rasmussen","original_name":"Kevin Rasmussen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"621fa43f9f1be7001b16c798","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1795616,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Robert K.
