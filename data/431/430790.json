On the verge of being broke, Handel struggled to write his celebrated oratorio, Messiah. The story behind Messiah celebrates freed debtors, charitable giving, rescued children, and the Messiah's mission to save God’s children from spiritual death.  With its Christ-centered focus, Hallelujah! invites listeners to feel the true meaning of Christmas. The music includes favorites such as “Do You Hear What I Hear?” performed by Osnes, “Oh, Come, All Ye Faithful,” “Angels from the Realms of Glory,” and many more, including a breathtaking rendition of “For unto Us a Child Is Born” from Handel’s Messiah, performed by the Metropolitan Opera soloists. The Christmas story, as told in the book of Luke in the New Testament, is poetically narrated by Jarvis.","popularity":0.869,"poster_path":"/bO4nN2stDaa69uxuxa9VjD1Jkdy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Square Featuring Laura Osnes and Martin Jarvis","title":"Hallelujah!","video":true,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Hallelujah!
