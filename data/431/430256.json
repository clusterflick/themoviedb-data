Beginning with the return journey to Cairo of a filmmaker long absent from her own country, the film weaves a series of intimate portraits composed of interviews, poetic voice-over and dance; exploring themes of oppression, guilt and faith with Egyptian women, many of them artists. Reflecting on Carl Theodor Dreyer’s 1928 film ‘The Passion of Joan of Arc’ – in which the female figure is martyred by the patriarchal forces surrounding her – ‘Jeanne’ is a contemporary commentary that melds documentary and dance with poetic storytelling and myth to arrive at the core of the filmmaker’s enquiries into the circumstances of women in Egypt today.","popularity":0.2523,"poster_path":"/8f4an3ikiEbn4hIL4MkaO5qgYp1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"KW","name":"Kuwait"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Egyptian Jeanne d’Arc","title":"Egyptian Joan of Arc","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1726455,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Talal Al-Muhanna","original_name":"Talal Al-Muhanna","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/maTNpdVrHSyPTaUGg4C4e06y5gD.jpg","credit_id":"62cb5353e8d0280052f151aa","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1587171,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iman Kamel","original_name":"Iman Kamel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58521a2c9251411a4601e461","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5887286","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.673,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8f4an3ikiEbn4hIL4MkaO5qgYp1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":673}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Arabic\", \"english_name\"=>\"Arabic\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ar\", \"native_name\"=>\"Arabic\"}","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
