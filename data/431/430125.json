Following the recent construction of a monument dedicated to Fascist general Rodolfo Graziani, the film addresses the unpunished war crimes he and others committed in the name of Mussolini’s imperial ambitions. The stories of three characters, filmed in present day Ethiopia, Italy and the United States, take the audience on a journey through the living memories and the tangible remains of the Italian occupation of Ethiopia — a journey that crosses generations and continents to today, where this often overlooked legacy still ties the fates of two nations and their people.","popularity":0.7611,"poster_path":"/y6vNfo2t8tJBT4lt90KOvb72yXB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118691,"logo_path":"/7bCr1H7KZ1WJbjXBqwfv8aWrgJE.png","name":"Awen Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ET","name":"Ethiopia"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2015-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If Only I Were That Warrior","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"If Only I Were That Warrior","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1509173,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valerio Ciriaci","original_name":"Valerio Ciriaci","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fkuHEsq94nmgfeKfQWFtnPfRQfe.jpg","credit_id":"585041a69251416fa100bfb1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1509173,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valerio Ciriaci","original_name":"Valerio Ciriaci","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fkuHEsq94nmgfeKfQWFtnPfRQfe.jpg","credit_id":"585041b39251411a4600b345","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1509173,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valerio Ciriaci","original_name":"Valerio Ciriaci","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/fkuHEsq94nmgfeKfQWFtnPfRQfe.jpg","credit_id":"5ce550299251412cecc13ed4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2318772,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Giovanni Pompetti","original_name":"Giovanni Pompetti","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce550790e0a265cdecc178c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2318770,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Isaak Liptzin","original_name":"Isaak Liptzin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce5505b0e0a262573ccda05","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2318770,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Isaak Liptzin","original_name":"Isaak Liptzin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce550670e0a265ac0cce9fe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2318767,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Luigi Porto","original_name":"Luigi Porto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce550180e0a265256d32f85","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1680655,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Michael Hernandez","original_name":"Michael Hernandez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce5509c0e0a265cdecc17db","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2318769,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Francesco Venturi","original_name":"Francesco Venturi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce5503ec3a368451124fffd","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3470192","wikidata_id":"Q42404849","facebook_id":"IOIWTW","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zcYfQPTe8ETbyKSUZAs1ClAEIUi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/y6vNfo2t8tJBT4lt90KOvb72yXB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1327,"name":"war crimes"},{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":14900,"name":"genocide"},{"id":158217,"name":"colonialism"},{"id":193744,"name":"italian occupation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"If Only I Were That Warrior (Trailer)","key":"WaNg8QnN2rY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-04-03T17:48:09.000Z","id":"5ce54bf1925141479bbb36af"}]}}}
