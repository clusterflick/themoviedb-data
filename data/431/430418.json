When Elinor becomes jealous of Julie Stressman, an old friend of Michael's and one of his models, Michael reluctantly asks Julie not to visit him at his studio. They agree to meet only at the construction site where he is working on a sculpture for which Julie is modeling. When Elinor also shows up at the site, Julie leaves so as to avoid a confrontation, but she is killed by some falling materials. Julie's dying request is that Michael adopt her daughter Mitzi, whose father died years earlier. In order to prevent Mitzi from being taken to an orphanage, Michael lies and says he is her father. Elinor hears this, and without asking questions, leaves him and marries another man the same night.","popularity":0.7021,"poster_path":"/gT8MF6jXsMi2IpNx5wAJaG0j5Ni.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1931-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beloved Bachelor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Prince Chap","type":"Alternate"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Lukas","original_name":"Paul Lukas","popularity":0.271,"profile_path":"/uPN8hpMtacoFylb0Ez9j800bilZ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Michael Morda","credit_id":"5853fb1ac3a3682fb8037b18","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Jordan","original_name":"Dorothy Jordan","popularity":0.2547,"profile_path":"/1VrpxvKxhWCwssMjeaeK5ne6ym2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mitzi","credit_id":"5853fb2a92514175ad0240cc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":95020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vivienne Osborne","original_name":"Vivienne Osborne","popularity":0.3358,"profile_path":"/vkkj0rQC6Ks9J5aP4N0RLGGW2I.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elinor Hunter","credit_id":"5853fb38c3a3682dfe030e8b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Ruggles","original_name":"Charles Ruggles","popularity":0.3605,"profile_path":"/auirQUnJ5kKBTl2p6kHtkJBNeo1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jerry Wells","credit_id":"5853fb45c3a3682f5802e305","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":131340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marjorie Gateson","original_name":"Marjorie Gateson","popularity":0.1378,"profile_path":"/tqh5vaRV3LPbEAMLJtcgX3UQ89g.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Hortense Cole","credit_id":"5853fb5092514175ad0240f5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1270909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Breeden","original_name":"John Breeden","popularity":0.0656,"profile_path":"/NVc7WXbdJDQRtpuaPTkpkWnyLs.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jimmy Martin","credit_id":"5853fb5dc3a3682fb8037b62","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1005423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Minjir","original_name":"Harold Minjir","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":"/c2BmgZjyd0OwgbfaMTaa7mUHoQM.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Winthrop Cole","credit_id":"5853fb69c3a3682dfe030eaf","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":975849,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leni Stengel","original_name":"Leni Stengel","popularity":0.3898,"profile_path":"/rZDr0A1W9iiAQ0D0EtFMOAkJcZb.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Julie Stressman","credit_id":"5853fb76925141724d00586c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1723456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Van Allen","original_name":"Betty Van Allen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mitzi, aged 6","credit_id":"5853fb8c92514146c901e7ce","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1097473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alma Chester","original_name":"Alma Chester","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/ptrqpbSjjxgjEyvZDxZdEDi4oY8.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Martha","credit_id":"5853fb9992514175ad024134","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guy Oliver","original_name":"Guy Oliver","popularity":0.1083,"profile_path":"/tLe4A808lGBfSenS42k1ZeAdZEO.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"John Adams","credit_id":"5853fba6c3a3682dfe030eee","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Corrigan","original_name":"Lloyd Corrigan","popularity":0.2651,"profile_path":"/vlcMdcXRbho8Zgm13dSeO9iDRQW.jpg","credit_id":"5853fbf5c3a368258c025dfe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78053,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edwin L.
