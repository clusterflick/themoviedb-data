The score, composed by Bob Christianson, recalls Broadway classics such as Les Miserables and The Phantom of the Opera, and is filled with memorable, haunting and rousing songs. It includes musical styles that range from classical to Broadway to blues and gospel. The story, faithfully adapted by Alisa Hauser (who also wrote the lyrics), is performed by leading lights from the Chicago and New York theater world, including Michael Aaron Lindner (Ebenezer Scrooge), E. Faye Butler (Narrator), Scott Coulter (Fred/Bob Cratchit), Kyle Scatliffe (Marley/The Ghosts), and Arya Daire (Belle).","popularity":0.0843,"poster_path":"/Aqi0BU02vR7VIN5OnYSRUbM6cFC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84586,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scrooge & Friends","origin_country":""},{"id":84587,"logo_path":null,"name":"HMS Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Christmas Carol: The Concert","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1724586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"E.
