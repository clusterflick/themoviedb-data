In San Francisco, he quickly became a fan favorite, which led to animosity with legend and fellow team member Willie Mays. He garnered many awards including Rookie of the Year, MVP, and won the World Series with the St. Louis Cardinals. After his retirement, he was arrested for drug smuggling and sentenced to a year in jail. He then turned his life around and became a Buddhist. In 1999, he was bestowed the greatest achievement any baseball player can receive -- induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame.","popularity":0.282,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":84402,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemar Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","name":"Puerto Rico"}],"release_date":"2001-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The life and times of controversial Hall-of-Fame slugger Orlando Cepeda","title":"Viva Cepeda!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1722275,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orlando Cepeda","original_name":"Orlando Cepeda","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/xh49eHFTzRb6wLJlDCaQl1PCWCW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"58502581c3a36831ce00ae63","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1722276,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Orlando Cepeda Jr.","original_name":"Orlando Cepeda Jr.","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5850258b9251411a46009d65","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1722278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felipe Alou","original_name":"Felipe Alou","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5850259c9251416f1000aa4d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1249479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dusty Baker","original_name":"Dusty Baker","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/rNlw0j9ivgxzxuMx3WyfnmlwEnk.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"585025a5c3a368312300a632","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pete Rose","original_name":"Pete Rose","popularity":0.205,"profile_path":"/n229KyhmFYRia5BTlZXB7AoMBG7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"585025b8c3a3682f5800a695","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1223844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bernie Williams","original_name":"Bernie Williams","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"585025c39251416fad00a9e0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1722279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juan Marichal","original_name":"Juan Marichal","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"585025dcc3a3682f5800a6b0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1722280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mirian Cepeda","original_name":"Mirian Cepeda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"585025ebc3a3682dfe00b7a6","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1722273,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mario Díaz","original_name":"Mario Díaz","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"585024629251416f1000a960","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1722274,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philip Klint","original_name":"Philip Klint","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5850247dc3a36831ce00ad81","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1059083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Meléndez","original_name":"Carlos Meléndez","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58502498c3a36831ce00ad95","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1722273,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mario Díaz","original_name":"Mario Díaz","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"585025719251416f1000aa20","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0832368","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
