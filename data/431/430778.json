The series rocketed in the ratings as an instant hit - despite the outcry of critics and moralists - who objected to the double-entendres and quasi-sexual hijinks on the show. However, the true behind-the-scenes story of 'Three's Company' will expose a once idyllic workplace that deteriorated into a battleground beset by business dealings, contact disputes, cast rivalries, clashes between producers and network executives and finally, a round of cast replacements which hastened the demise of the show.","popularity":1.8337,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":84564,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZIFF Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":7928,"logo_path":"/tsa8zFtAIHlOJjL5G4fe75bBeCP.png","name":"NBC Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":41629,"logo_path":"/lCe8XkwpMEzLu5NJe0KSGsmMJSr.png","name":"Nitelite Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4062,"logo_path":null,"name":"Once Upon a Time Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Jealousy.
