That was then, however, this is now.  A revered \"historical\" movie quietly takes every opporturnity to lie and twist the facts in order to make Christians appear as backward, foolish hypocrites.  An actress jumps at the chance to play a Christ-hating role, saying, \"I'm an atheist, so it was a joy.\"  One of Hollywood's most respected directors films a passion play written by a disciple of Friedrich Nietzsche, the father of the \"God is dead\" movement. Not surprisingly, the movie's Jesus helps crucify people and later confesses that satan is inside him.  A media mogul states that \"Christianity is a religion for losers.\"","popularity":0.4091,"poster_path":"/9X93hHosNxWv34V4WLIXEFd2bxX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84557,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Portrait","origin_country":""},{"id":99344,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reel 2 Real Ministries","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Examination of The Modern Media's Anti-Christian Bias","title":"Hollywood: Lights, Camera, Blasphemy!","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1491415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Holmberg","original_name":"Eric Holmberg","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/msCUnXQmGLclbLci2RNGniBzNJX.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Host","credit_id":"5856c4f99251416fad04e794","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1491415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Holmberg","original_name":"Eric Holmberg","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/msCUnXQmGLclbLci2RNGniBzNJX.jpg","credit_id":"662fcf7e1f0275012a14dfc4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1491415,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Holmberg","original_name":"Eric Holmberg","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/msCUnXQmGLclbLci2RNGniBzNJX.jpg","credit_id":"5d0c48e30e0a263e84cbcdf2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2343380,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Gregory","original_name":"Steven Gregory","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d0c49f3c3a368063a1fc480","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1040021,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erik Hollander","original_name":"Erik Hollander","popularity":0.0547,"profile_path":"/cYtUJdt5u6hPjKYsNgo8CTDRKeL.jpg","credit_id":"5d0c4a120e0a263dddcbc7f8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18071024","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mfr6kpvi7LR0XQWtdlcGAWr2WuZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9X93hHosNxWv34V4WLIXEFd2bxX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3099,"name":"satanism"},{"id":11208,"name":"conspiracy theory"},{"id":9309,"name":"elite"},{"id":12396,"name":"hollywood"},{"id":204293,"name":"babylon"},{"id":210137,"name":"christian propaganda"},{"id":231189,"name":"anti-christian"},{"id":308915,"name":"sacrilege"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Hollywood   Lights, Camera Blasphemy!
