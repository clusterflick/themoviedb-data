Sudden success can be constraining, and the Daytona Beach-based Live finds guitarist Joe Don Rooney and cousins Jay DeMarcus and Gary Levox--the band's multi-instrumentalist and vocalist, respectively--occasionally (okay, very occasionally) indulging musical passions beyond the slick-and-safe country pop and frothy love-anthems that have endeared them (as a supporting act) to Alan Jackson and Toby Keith's audiences. Among other things, the trio sounds fit to burst with gospel, as suggested by DeMarcus's cameo role as vocalist on a cover of \"Lean on Me.\" (Um, do these guys know he's a better singer than Levox?) There's even a detectable groove on \"Prayin' for Daylight,\" and the group's blowout encore, a cover of Boston's \"Long Time,\" suggests a healthy restlessness within Rascal Flatts' ranks.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rascal Flatts Live","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
