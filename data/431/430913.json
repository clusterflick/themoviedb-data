The deceased partner was in his lifetime as mean and miserly as Scrooge is now and he warns him to change his ways or face the consequences in the afterlife. Scrooge dismisses the apparition but the first of the three ghosts, the Ghost of Christmas Past, visits as promised. Scrooge sees those events in his past life, both happy and sad, that forged his character. The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, shows him how many currently celebrate Christmas. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come shows him how he will be remembered once he is gone. To his delight, the spirits complete their visits in one night giving him the opportunity to mend his ways.","popularity":0.4786,"poster_path":"/84fcG1pezqwIgJTmKe3OSMyRUTJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125458,"logo_path":null,"name":"BKN International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Christmas Carol","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"A Christmas Carol: Scrooge's Ghostly Tale","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":997860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Bentinck","original_name":"Tim Bentinck","popularity":0.3398,"profile_path":"/yg2EErH28vqi6O1FH9DwJt0w7fu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ebenezer Scrooge / Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"6520c6650cb33500fedec367","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4309104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Bowles","original_name":"Brian Bowles","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Bob Cratchit (voice)","credit_id":"6520c6eec50ad2014dd185ea","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":340927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Gallagher","original_name":"Teresa Gallagher","popularity":0.4051,"profile_path":"/2oHiEkrPfgbfKllBFDAhZK4v1Of.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Tiny Tim / Ghost of Christmas Past / Fan (voice)","credit_id":"6520c7015b124000e3d3eb74","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":477282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Wickham","original_name":"Keith Wickham","popularity":0.3256,"profile_path":"/t1bB7BaVV6UBM1QfTiZzuEtDcC7.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Jacob Marley / Ghosts of Christmas Present, Future (voice)","credit_id":"6520c7585b124000e3d3ebb7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4309107,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jo Wyatt","original_name":"Jo Wyatt","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mrs. Cratchit (voice)","credit_id":"6520c77b0cb33500ac493525","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1214713,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sean Catherine Derek","original_name":"Sean Catherine Derek","popularity":0.281,"profile_path":"/r7CWvmoGwSkvdHwDp6xArCFrvSQ.jpg","credit_id":"5857fc5ac3a3682dfe05e787","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1103597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ric Machin","original_name":"Ric Machin","popularity":0.0986,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59b0c58a92514107af07c233","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3557,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Dickens","original_name":"Charles Dickens","popularity":0.5721,"profile_path":"/vuy9knaprX05bT4WNJki5iDPfsK.jpg","credit_id":"5ac37fd60e0a260c0103317b","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2627630","wikidata_id":"Q4655900","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/84fcG1pezqwIgJTmKe3OSMyRUTJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1065}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
