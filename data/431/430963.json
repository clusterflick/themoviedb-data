The hero, an Orthodox Christian monk, finds himself on a road to spiritual healing through circumstances he could never have dreamed of. The story follows the path to spiritual uplifting, metaphorically introduced at the very beginning in the hero's walk to the secluded hermitage. The leitmotif of watering a dry, dead tree, repeated throughout the film, illustrates the absurdity of the monk's faith. The permanent paralysis of the characters after the torment of war invokes forgiveness as the only means to ultimate healing.","popularity":0.3928,"poster_path":"/uENCGkL7khA55gjKsOrqJUfDNI7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73363,"logo_path":"/tzD6DUp353iviKhmYxsvC1L755i.png","name":"Cinnamon Production","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Healing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","title":"Исцељење","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1724959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nemanja Jeremić","original_name":"Nemanja Jeremić","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dečak","credit_id":"5858584a925141594100f130","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jovo Maksić","original_name":"Jovo Maksić","popularity":0.221,"profile_path":"/3EnxE3TyXtTzQL6rnfnENXHTqcB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Monah","credit_id":"585858599251411a46063369","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1531125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Radovan Miljanić","original_name":"Radovan Miljanić","popularity":0.0912,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Deda","credit_id":"5858585fc3a3682f5805eb4e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1724957,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Jović","original_name":"Ivan Jović","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"585857e79251411a460632ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1724958,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Monja Jović","original_name":"Monja Jović","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"585857f1c3a36806a7053a88","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3452884","wikidata_id":"Q20435914","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"sr","file_path":"/uENCGkL7khA55gjKsOrqJUfDNI7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":857}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":345,"name":"monk"},{"id":5314,"name":"mill"},{"id":11004,"name":"rural area"},{"id":183987,"name":"orthodox"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
