Twenty-one politicians who, from one day to the next, find themselves at the head of a ministry by the grace of a President of the Republic and his Prime Minister. The formation of the government, conflicts of attribution, reshuffles, rumours of appointments, evictions, casting errors: it is all the capricious backstage of the games of power examined here under the angle of confidence and which sheds light on the prestigious but unknown function of minister. An original and instructive political saga on the reality of those who hold or have held this prestigious position.","popularity":0.5467,"poster_path":"/9suuvNoS8VkgmwRcPfiX1aDOfnv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/qpFsGoa96SytbWkhtkkpllu5Cch.png","name":"France
