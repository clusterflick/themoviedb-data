The film is, in a way, the memory of a journey and a transition. This is the recording of how Jon Ander, born in Bermeo and used to the countryside life, decides to move to Bilbao and establish a relation with the city from his home. A small story to immerse ourselves in the idea that individual normality is a fabricated idea, as happens with traditions, systems and cities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harria eta bidea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3291654,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aitane Go침i Landa","original_name":"Aitane Go침i Landa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617ec5ee5294e7006517dd04","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3291655,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paula G칩mez","original_name":"Paula G칩mez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617ec5f9cb6db5008d4963d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
