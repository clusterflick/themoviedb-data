Impending divorce, job loss, substance abuse, and a mid-life crisis are all factors that can cause him to go off the rails. In addition, the sudden death of his father forces him to return home to Anishiinabe territory, a place he has tried to avoid since his youth. Nevertheless, Mathieu agrees to go and deposit his father's ashes in the heart of their ancestral territory and wishes to find himself at the same time. The break away from the city promises to be a nice getaway until Mathieu realizes that he is now the prey of an evil creature known as the Wendigo. Mathieu's pilgrimage quickly becomes an unimaginable nightmare that will change him forever. Like it or not, our vices always catch up with us eventually.","popularity":0.3817,"poster_path":"/yy1NZ0F0HDNM0AypYVfRrqaDuga.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64324,"logo_path":"/5mhgTCow1DvznQsrv9yk8Rffj4g.png","name":"Nish Media","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Inhumain","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samian","original_name":"Samian","popularity":0.0969,"profile_path":"/zBlYqkb0S4S28ZVFBDjQCu2VRcn.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mathieu Côté","credit_id":"618065404a4bfc002d6e3c43","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1299886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Véronique Beaudet","original_name":"Véronique Beaudet","popularity":0.116,"profile_path":"/1mJTKV5H4yWE0mdzkmcIVVDMYbY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Julie","credit_id":"618065555294e70044085061","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1683996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanne Roux-Coté","original_name":"Jeanne Roux-Coté","popularity":0.1323,"profile_path":"/ApWdMdtnxsvH0hH4vhetGzh8Ac9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maude","credit_id":"61806561a3d027008c732385","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1195722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonia Vigneault","original_name":"Sonia Vigneault","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/d5J2biQHKW9y1c3fbDNu0mJf8jv.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Johanne","credit_id":"6180656e39a1a600917d4012","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1515820,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Brennan","original_name":"Jason Brennan","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6180650dc7c22400938fec79","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1515820,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Brennan","original_name":"Jason Brennan","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618065135294e70044085026","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1650753,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Amélie Labrèche","original_name":"Amélie Labrèche","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/igeO0ZdoEQao7044N5FLAvXAngi.jpg","credit_id":"6625cf652e2b2c0130656ff1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15094736","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b4EGVNS7Ys0edYyXwRvbMYsx70V.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iXyMJ4VZkbthvScoyi1Zpk1kZnn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/zTPp5wkAX86hGHs0cpVyRVobOXc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1477,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yy1NZ0F0HDNM0AypYVfRrqaDuga.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/yhSn9nDCknRKUYkaRZg4IbfGRH2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":193167,"name":"wendigo"},{"id":287134,"name":"anishiinabe"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"18A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
