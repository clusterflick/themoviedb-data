Aligermaa adores and dreams of horses, and is happily surprised when her family enroll her in the annual horse race during the national festival of Naadam. Aligermaa is proud, but also a little nervous, especially when she learns that she will train with the famous horse trainer Sodnom – and that she will be riding the white stallion. But on a stormy night before the race Aligermaa's horse is attacked and wounded, and suddenly nothing seems certain.  The Adventures of Aligermaa is a vivid and thrilling documentary. The filmmakers seemingly had close contact with the main characters and their culture, and the result is a heartfelt film with breathtaking panoramas and a captivating storyline.","popularity":0.0964,"poster_path":"/caY8XEnecGx0pbX0TICsQgjk4lA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130607,"logo_path":null,"name":"Manden med Cameraet ApS","origin_country":""},{"id":3159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Migma Film","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1998-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mongolian","iso_639_1":"mn","name":""},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Adventures of Aligermaa","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1264182,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andra Lasmanis","original_name":"Andra Lasmanis","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6191866d458199008f904d92","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3309632,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Palle Vedel","original_name":"Palle Vedel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6191867b8d77c4002aba5f65","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1613709,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Staffan Julén","original_name":"Staffan Julén","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/As7NHkKkz2CKJVSvpfTsVGESAeB.jpg","credit_id":"61918773957e6d00297eec8d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":63747,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Croneman","original_name":"Anna Croneman","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61918761c4ad5900446eeb01","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0120236","wikidata_id":"Q16496252","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":880,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/caY8XEnecGx0pbX0TICsQgjk4lA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"","release_date":"1998-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
