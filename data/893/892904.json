Using written text, still images, blocks of color, and original and found footage, the film draws together three connected lines: the Paterson, New Jersey silk workers strike of 1913; the use of moving images in time and motion studies used to regulate and accelerate the pace of mechanized work; and a toxic magenta dye called Rhodamine B, once used by rebelling workers to sabotage production and now fed directly to silkworms, turning their bodies themselves into miniature dye houses.
