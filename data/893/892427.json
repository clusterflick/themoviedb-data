Throughout art history, the female body has been depicted as a passive figure and object. Itâ€™s time to understand it as active, with a voice, capable of actions. The work investigates from a neutral perspective, leaving space for an independent creature with a strong voice. It does not need to be put in relation to an action or an object to exist. It takes its own breaths.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/hHBC1Z3dJ9VjOTinSGTOkpetbf9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revealing the Essence in a Portrait","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3292004,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josephine Baltzersen","original_name":"Josephine Baltzersen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"617f044d2975ca004344c732","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hHBC1Z3dJ9VjOTinSGTOkpetbf9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
