Did she run out of fuel and crash into the sea? Or could she have survived? Investigators have built the case that Amelia Earhart was a pawn in an espionage plot for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, while eyewitnesses testified that she was captured by the Japanese military. Examining facts and evidence, National Geographic explores one of the most fiercely debated mysteries of all time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"National Geographic, Where's Amelia Earhart","title":"National Geographic, Where's Amelia Earhart","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
