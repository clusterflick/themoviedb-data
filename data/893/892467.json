Stories that have lured youths to the Pope Lick trestle in search of a dare, a thrill, a place to drink, an opportunity to scare a date or a friend.  A legend kept alive only by word of mouth - confirmed by the excitable and credulous minds of adolescents and emphasized by the ominous presence of 100-foot railroad trestle.  One crisp, October evening finds Clancy, Ben and Katie on a quest - for excitement, for beer, for danger and a rendezvous with...the Sheepman!","popularity":0.3044,"poster_path":"/q4hRtbckL2Gz4AbSh16JBRciYVv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163588,"logo_path":null,"name":"Germantown
