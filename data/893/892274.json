The function of prime minister, torn between the president and the parliament, appointed without necessarily being elected but responsible for everything, is at the center of debate. With the exception of Jacques Chirac (1974-1976 and 1986-1988), deliberately left out because of his image as French President, those who governed France for the past 35 years agreed to discuss the exercise of power, as seen through archive footage, but also how they experienced it personally. Filmed in the same studio and sitting in the same chair, 12 French prime ministers talk freely about their time in office, from their appointment until their resignation.","popularity":0.3435,"poster_path":"/2q3IIrtswFE7bIJPkjCt6RdFqcd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18740,"logo_path":"/11dLmhNuO6Pgd8tSDvktsOkP94R.png","name":"Zadig
