In the 1920s, Emma and Marcelle met at school in Dijon. Secretly, love blossomed between the two teenage girls, but after two years they parted ways. Marcelle developed tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium. Complementing the sparse photographs of the women, Hunzinger combines archive footage, avant-garde films, and music to create a sensuous, poetic atmosphere.","popularity":0.1238,"poster_path":"/5BWRBOBMQ4S1SbWhnfqnotP8COS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":189264,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ana Films","origin_country":""},{"id":173217,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ciclic-Region Centre-Val de Loire","origin_country":""},{"id":185528,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bip TV","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ultraviolette and the Blood-Spitters Gang","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4904372,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claudie Hunzinger","original_name":"Claudie Hunzinger","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"(voix - voice)","credit_id":"66cba96e01e75e2366328ac6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2241402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Hunzinger","original_name":"Robin Hunzinger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61804db0229ae20064a6b388","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1320897,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Siegfried Canto","original_name":"Siegfried Canto","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ac574cc56d2d00d8414679","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848484,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Milana Christitch","original_name":"Milana Christitch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ac5743c56d2d0089b028af","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4904372,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claudie Hunzinger","original_name":"Claudie Hunzinger","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cba7ecf5c6fbe1743d1747","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2241402,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Hunzinger","original_name":"Robin Hunzinger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cbad8072ec07b8042d66e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt18282216","wikidata_id":"Q109918371","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/esveCwc98RwsS8IJUIhTyuzBJxk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r0GO1o3EuUnSoorBRyRJkUydTts.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kRho9ygFxudKGwQ0snhzBMWio4h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5BWRBOBMQ4S1SbWhnfqnotP8COS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rM0xVNdt7545iQmcWIJrhfO2Ux4.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/66KoMuXo9L2yTHAv5E4b2yy6BF7.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":563},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/2hwfewdVjo7ik0veSymWVfmEDMs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3929,"name":"hope"},{"id":34079,"name":"death"},{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"},{"id":250606,"name":"queer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Everybody's Perfect, Geneva International Queer Film Festival","release_date":"2022-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Le mois du documentaire, Lyon","release_date":"2021-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Paris Chéries Chéris Film Festival","release_date":"2021-11-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Lyon Écrans Mixtes Festival","release_date":"2022-03-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DMZ International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2022-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
