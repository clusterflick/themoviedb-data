A Dragonfly couple struggle with co-dependency; she's literally on top of him. A Grasshopper, addicted to coffee, is so jumpy, he launches himself in mid-sentence. A Praying Mantis who doesn't pray because she thinks she is God. A terrified Spider is deathly afraid of -- spiders. And, a perfectly-camouflaged Stick Bug complains that no one ever \"sees\" him. Throughout all this, Citronella battles her urge to flee - while Dr. Pill implores her to share her \"embarrassing\" problem.","popularity":1.5973,"poster_path":"/8sDZsXuqOaoUpihKpDivvy7ev7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Citronella Stories, LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's okay to not be okay!","title":"Bug Therapy","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1452128,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meghan Trainor","original_name":"Meghan Trainor","popularity":0.7769,"profile_path":"/vmDN7wBZ51EvtT4hu447VUGXq1a.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Citronella (voice)","credit_id":"617d9a93d6dbba0044c1ecb4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil McGraw","original_name":"Phil McGraw","popularity":0.3966,"profile_path":"/71Nqs57x1sIbWvy6SjYLAo5KcUQ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Dr. Pill (voice)","credit_id":"617d9aaba097dc009223ba3a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1225953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sterling K.
