Leah suggests that the three come to her house and have a jolly time. The two sweethearts, Tony and Fritz, are married men, Tony being Fritz's father-in-law. Each leaves home in the morning, claiming to have an important engagement for the day. Fritz arrives first, with parcels of good things to eat, and Lizette and her friend Tony arrive soon after. The scene which follows may be better imagined than described. However the two men pledge secrecy, and the party proves a huge success. An unexpected sequel follows the next day, for the wives happen to make purchases at the millinery shop in which the girls are employed. On delivering the hats, Leah and Lizette meet their sweethearts and learn that they are married men. Accusations, excuses and a general scrimmage follow.
