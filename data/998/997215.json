The original material is a result of an intervalometer test of soft focus automotive headlights shot in the early 2000’s. In 2017, the footage was rediscovered and reworked into a composite of various arrangements engaging in the filmmakers preoccupation with abstraction. The audio arrangement is a collage of various found material which was originally recorded in the late 1960’s. As a whole, the work creates a spectrum of proximities.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nwRBRXOZYVvbEUrI9g78C652H84.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Moons of Palaver","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3615640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Gaucher","original_name":"Eric Gaucher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c75120cf62cd005108f0d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nwRBRXOZYVvbEUrI9g78C652H84.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
