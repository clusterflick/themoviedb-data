Veteran Sam has never recovered from his tour of Vietnam. With noting left but his knowledge, he earns coins with his poor recitations of Shakespeare. Equally traumatized Sarah ended up in the streets when a fire destroyed her home and family. She lives alone in an abandoned building. They meet when Sam saves Sarah from being beaten up by a gang. As he takes care of her broken body and spirit, a tentative relationship begins.","popularity":0.1996,"poster_path":"/2VUZQ81YCHOpMRdC2HGTOpsrWQc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sam and Sarah","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1411955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Rothman","original_name":"Robert Rothman","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sam","credit_id":"62c79b4958361b004d2c0b8d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3615985,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katheen Sykoa","original_name":"Katheen Sykoa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sarah","credit_id":"62c79b51f74f5f0055c92ff6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3615986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolyn Knodes","original_name":"Carolyn Knodes","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Terry Quinn","credit_id":"62c79b5912c604004ca7d8d5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3615988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Gerace","original_name":"Charles Gerace","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"T J","credit_id":"62c79b620bb0760051b45763","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83949,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Strysik","original_name":"John Strysik","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c79b2f706b9f0050c16ae9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1411955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Rothman","original_name":"Robert Rothman","popularity":0.0577,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c79b3ff29d66005145415f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83949,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Strysik","original_name":"John Strysik","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c79b36b7abb5036afdb3c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0098247","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.755,"height":1610,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2VUZQ81YCHOpMRdC2HGTOpsrWQc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1216}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
