In his Met-debut staging, McBurney lets loose a volley of theatrical flourishes, incorporating projections, sound effects, and acrobatics to match the spectacle and drama of Mozart’s fable. The brilliant cast includes soprano Erin Morley as Pamina, tenor Lawrence Brownlee as Tamino, baritone Thomas Oliemans in his Met debut as Papageno, soprano Kathryn Lewek as the Queen of the Night, and bass Stephen Milling as Sarastro.","popularity":0.1798,"poster_path":"/4FihyVpqBW4NA77g5eg6DmIaCg2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":172,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Die Zauberflöte","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1438032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erin Morley","original_name":"Erin Morley","popularity":0.0642,"profile_path":"/wy0ZL6gbltavBKAp2dRaWN7xpF6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Pamina","credit_id":"62c6fcf0b7abb5036afd5d89","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2465231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathryn Lewek","original_name":"Kathryn Lewek","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Queen of the Night","credit_id":"62c6fd07907f260132fddf3e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3588458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lawrence Brownlee","original_name":"Lawrence Brownlee","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Tamino","credit_id":"62c6fd14706b9f0050c1182b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1563365,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Oliemans","original_name":"Thomas Oliemans","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Papageno","credit_id":"62c6fd1f58361b005fd26806","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Milling","original_name":"Stephen Milling","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/lnQCcY0Nbst22KcKxJKTyuDCsbm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sarastro","credit_id":"62c6fd2e12c604004f1365d9","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sEMMpCHHLAFUVwQrOUvk6PZag2X.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4FihyVpqBW4NA77g5eg6DmIaCg2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"The Met: Live in HD 2022-23 Season","release_date":"2023-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Met: Live in HD 2022-23 Season Trailer","key":"dLpFcocpou4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-06-14T13:00:38.000Z","id":"62c72d80cf62cd006971604f"}]}}}
