Dr. Felix Kersten, Himmler’s trusted personal physiotherapist, uses his unique position of influence to facilitate a meeting between the architect of The Holocaust and Swedish Jew Norbert Masur. A meeting that could turn Himmler’s thoughts away from the downfall of the Third Reich and towards a course of action that could save thousands of lives.  With battle lines crumbling and lives in the balance, the two men must try to find a way to persuade Himmler to release the last surviving concentration camp prisoners contrary to Hitler’s orders that no Jew should outlast the regime.","popularity":0.1864,"poster_path":"/tZxjBJLoLX0jRzgqymFsKY7ZOqQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Original Theatre Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End of the Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1704853,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivia Bernstone","original_name":"Olivia Bernstone","popularity":0.1708,"profile_path":"/7rQGrzEHEZ7iBIrlVzbBDIIhnvP.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jeanne","credit_id":"62c9cf674b9bae0a50ca5970","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":203581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Caplan","original_name":"Ben Caplan","popularity":0.2031,"profile_path":"/vYPuTXPfHccKSdjAOPp7FBE3wqm.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Norbert Masur","credit_id":"62c9cff505f9cf006785fa11","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":192970,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Clothier","original_name":"Richard Clothier","popularity":0.1983,"profile_path":"/6jXifv63xSKKquCrwGDCTcHdgx7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Heinrich Himmler","credit_id":"62c9d01cfd4a96004fb9a845","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1487961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Lumsden","original_name":"Michael Lumsden","popularity":0.1288,"profile_path":"/svFVz2D2Fib7ZkP8LhOmMsdK3pc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Felix Kersten","credit_id":"62c9d03be8131d0689ae1d62","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3617919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Audrey Palmer","original_name":"Audrey Palmer","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/fNLgQTkfWvxnRJRaiBYDZKAJb2u.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Elisabeth Lube","credit_id":"62c9d05ea06efe004f2c879e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3393935,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ben Brown","original_name":"Ben Brown","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c9cebad70594004e0e7798","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2039571,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Strachan","original_name":"Alan Strachan","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c9cecea06efe004f2c86e0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iaYFHwWvOBLArAclWaJejNjOVZy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2276,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tZxjBJLoLX0jRzgqymFsKY7ZOqQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1517}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The End of the Night by Ben Brown","key":"O52K39jDAGg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-05-11T16:30:53.000Z","id":"62c9d160fd4a96004cec5e94"}]}}}
