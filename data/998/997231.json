Under the cover of night, he trespasses onto the plantation grounds and enters a scarcely seen world, where coercive living conditions and labor practices have changed alarmingly little since the plantation opened in 1926. Journalistic access to the plantation is tightly controlled and monitored by the company, and Ryoâ€™s footage is a rare independent vision of the lives of plantation workers.","popularity":0.0808,"poster_path":"/p1OaYvWFcYu3ArU8pk9pclAtii1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LR","name":"Liberia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notes from Liberia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1458261,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chris Iversen","original_name":"Chris Iversen","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c75744c68b69004f73c1f4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937661,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ryo Murakami","original_name":"Ryo Murakami","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c7572b447f9c004e49d7ae","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2551883,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"David Lieberman","original_name":"David Lieberman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c7575412c604004f1398c5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937661,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ryo Murakami","original_name":"Ryo Murakami","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c75734f056d5004c7ec9ba","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judd Ehrlich","original_name":"Judd Ehrlich","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":"/tvsGfEgvwy3N0a87g4lw29YLozn.jpg","credit_id":"62c75717f29d66004e4107ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937659,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Judd Ehrlich","original_name":"Judd Ehrlich","popularity":0.073,"profile_path":"/tvsGfEgvwy3N0a87g4lw29YLozn.jpg","credit_id":"67d768def6b8d57b4a7bbdb5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4175002","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/p1OaYvWFcYu3ArU8pk9pclAtii1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docudays UA","release_date":"2015-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
