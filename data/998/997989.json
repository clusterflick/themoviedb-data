Not all fought in the Russian-Ukrainian war, but it, regardless, shattered their life plans. Representing 'Generation Maidan', they face the question of how to cope with experiences of violence, how to go on. A local theatre director produces Hamlet, wherein they can use Shakespeare’s tragic character as a mirror and face their traumas onstage. For them, 'to be or not to be' is not simply text but an existential dilemma with no clear answer.","popularity":1.0906,"poster_path":"/pR2nEuSXnhJcszhnn4hvHu0jfZ2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80152,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kundschafter
