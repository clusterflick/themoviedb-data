Through music we visit all layers of society. In the form of a poem we show how it feels when your country is in an unwinnable conflict. Dusk sets the scene for a war that came unexpectedly. The soldier smokes his last cigarette in the window before taking the elevator to certain death. A mother prays for the sons of Ukraine. A babushka at Maidan sings: “If he meets death – may it be instant”.","popularity":0.0773,"poster_path":"/dzvMs0hGJu9Q1i0O8qDyl1Za7rq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2015-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Place We Call Our Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3615686,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sybilla Marie Wester Tuxen","original_name":"Sybilla Marie Wester Tuxen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c7548c0bb076004ee5a092","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1765878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thora Lorentzen","original_name":"Thora Lorentzen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c7547d2cde9800523f1410","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3615688,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mik Stampe Fogh","original_name":"Mik Stampe Fogh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c754a1a0b6b5072707309f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5201846","wikidata_id":"Q33575764","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dzvMs0hGJu9Q1i0O8qDyl1Za7rq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docudays UA","release_date":"2015-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
