The use of CGI and 3D mapping provides a very clear view of this ancient superstructure and eight centuries of urban evolution. We will revive this great historical fresco through accounts by international archaeologists and historians. Pompeii: The Origins is a journey to the heart of an ancient ‘motion designed’ city.","popularity":0.1348,"poster_path":"/39tep7cuMQdjXN9QOW2KyqSHLnJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16180,"logo_path":"/tE5t6MnMhvyc34beR4Qf6hM2c5K.png","name":"INA","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pompeii: The Origins","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Origins of Pompeii","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3096826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolas Djermag","original_name":"Nicolas Djermag","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"62c79f3012c604004ca7db35","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3616013,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles-Henri Georget","original_name":"Charles-Henri Georget","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c79eeeb7abb5036afdb5d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2223756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Serge Tignères","original_name":"Serge Tignères","popularity":0.172,"profile_path":"/5XLbWfUhmW7GlzAhOB7jPv4b1mp.jpg","credit_id":"62c79f0bbefd91004da38ec3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20317806","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xbzSVmI6pLt2LiAoscgYeJVVyMi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/39tep7cuMQdjXN9QOW2KyqSHLnJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/8HQHbi2J3153KmrWP81E7UPxTce.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"E","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
