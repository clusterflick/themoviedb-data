The first embraces one of the few definitions of the word clinker, which is to play a wrong musical note. Consequently, the audio composition is intentionally fractured and generated with mistakes. Secondly, the video loosely borrows visual inspiration from the Italian poet Lucretiusâ€™ poem The Nature of Things. More specifically, book two entitled The Dance of Atoms. As a result, the joined notions explore a relationship through a lyrical yet abstract synthesis.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/fulD9A9uotwq27jutiRWJ0E0j4b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clinker","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3615640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Gaucher","original_name":"Eric Gaucher","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c74fce58361b004d2befd6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":895,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fulD9A9uotwq27jutiRWJ0E0j4b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":596}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
