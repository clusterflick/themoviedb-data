Its underlying subject is the origin of civilization - as comprised entirely of media clips. In the summer of 1971 Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos announced the discovery of a tribe of primitive cave dwellers who had lived in complete isolation for thousands of years in the rain forest of Mindanao. The Tasaday indigenous group represented a chance to witness firsthand the roots of our culture, and to explore the very essence of humanity. They also-as we learn-offered Marcos and his cronies a unique political opportunity.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Book of Paradise Has No Author","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross Lipman","original_name":"Ross Lipman","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68757c80528b9f61f18e4e9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross Lipman","original_name":"Ross Lipman","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68757c93c4b67c0577f91c31","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross Lipman","original_name":"Ross Lipman","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68757cb2b150528ec04438b7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37542604","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New York Premiere","release_date":"2025-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
