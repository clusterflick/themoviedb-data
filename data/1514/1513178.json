The protagonist is a refugee from Sri Lanka who returns to the country and is forcibly admitted into a valley resort that has been converted into an isolation facility. Once there, memories from his Sri Lankan past haunt him, but, instead of producing fear, as is the facility’s intention, the experience has the opposite effect. He develops love and compassion from meeting strangers.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":74860,"logo_path":"/pTTMbWTvq1cLOPSk2tkFuaD88hq.png","name":"House on Fire","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":95254,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Council Productions","origin_country":"LK"},{"id":49104,"logo_path":"/ltAXIxwQQcAY5uc864bxPN14oph.png","name":"Studio Orlando","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":182169,"logo_path":"/9nbEMaERHUziUZAxsuSbCLcVPaM.png","name":"TAICCA","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LK","name":"Sri Lanka"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Sinhalese","iso_639_1":"si","name":"සිංහල"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Turtle's Gaze on Spying Stars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":929363,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vimukthi Jayasundara","original_name":"Vimukthi Jayasundara","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68752fde472007e4908e81eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1078761,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nila Madhab Panda","original_name":"Nila Madhab Panda","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":"/h3Oo17tFoCHrwgWITtU43aJGRvc.jpg","credit_id":"6875301a86d0265a27baa3b0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71401,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Vincent Wang","original_name":"Vincent Wang","popularity":0.1284,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6875303d9fc67cab17f91aa9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50023,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frédéric Bellaïche","original_name":"Frédéric Bellaïche","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687530524a30f239a4443695","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt24072376","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
