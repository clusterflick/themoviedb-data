March 1944. German forces are occupying Katterat station. The Iversens are passing information from Narvik to England in secret. When they realize that German troops are on to them, they plan their escape. They summon the border guide Olav, who helps them plan how to get to safety in neutral Sweden. The escape does not go quite according to plan, however, and turns into a battle of life and death in the unforgiving North Norwegian winter. With German troops on their tail, Lilly and her daughter Anna, along with Olav, the border guide, are now hurrying through the frozen terrain knowing that even the smallest mistake will cost them their lives.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/6cNAANyIKH1XG3NQYmcaIej63VO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Crossing","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La Fuga de Katterat","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ボーダーエスケープ","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Flucht aus Katterat","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2448932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Simonsen Balmbra","original_name":"Thomas Simonsen Balmbra","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68764c557cc282d08473324e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2448932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Simonsen Balmbra","original_name":"Thomas Simonsen Balmbra","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68764c5b6061895553d160f5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5565571,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wiktor Simonsen","original_name":"Wiktor Simonsen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68764c64d183f490d463747a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14124038","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":"no","file_path":"/6cNAANyIKH1XG3NQYmcaIej63VO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"no","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
