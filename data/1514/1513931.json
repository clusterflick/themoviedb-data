This all changes when she is told just moments before her own wedding that she is adopted. Confused and shocked, she runs away and follows the only clue she has to a small town on the other side of Oklahoma.  That's where Julie meets the stoic yet secretly sweet Cass, a Native bartender who would rather be reading or fixing up an old car than in any sort of social setting. They both can feel the instant chemistry which only furthers the identity crisis Julie is having.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Julie Takes a Walk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5566799,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kendall Davis","original_name":"Kendall Davis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Julie","credit_id":"6876e5a034256c559a2e8ce5","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5566792,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shea Vassar","original_name":"Shea Vassar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6876e4f862db22df0477977a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5566792,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shea Vassar","original_name":"Shea Vassar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6876e50785febea71e6ab0bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4068537,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anpa’o Locke","original_name":"Anpa’o Locke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6876e51ca92cd3c7a4779786","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5566794,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Shayna Mayci Warner","original_name":"Shayna Mayci Warner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6876e53599edc017e5cf140f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5566796,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francesca Pedersen","original_name":"Francesca Pedersen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6876e55248e8d32137cf1423","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
