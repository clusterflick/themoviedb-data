Drifting through disappearing neighbourhoods on car and bus rides, she finds herself amidst fields of shifting watercolours and emotive strokes on yellow post-it notes. They unravel, blur, and collapse into ephemeral fragments of a recalled landscape— a home once so familiar, yet no longer exists.  In its meditation on memory’s multiple facets and subjectivity, these hazy vignettes recreate lost sensibilities of warmth the artist holds closely to her heart, out of love for her grandmother.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Popo's Favourite Colour is Yellow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5566897,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Winnie Chua","original_name":"Winnie Chua","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6876f826d83bff3034165ad2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
