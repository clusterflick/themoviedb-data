It was the first \"sound\" film in Brazil, that is, with actors dubbing themselves live, behind the screen, based on already recorded images. Premiered on September 1, 1908. It was produced by the company William e Cia. The film was inspired by the operetta \"Les contes d'Hoffmann\", by composer and cellist Jacques Offenbach.  The film's synopsis is unknown, but given the name, which references the song \"Barcarolle\", it is very likely that it is inspired by the third act of Les contes d'Hoffmann. Like many films from this era, Barcarola is considered a lost film, with only one surviving image, taken during the film's production.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":267994,"logo_path":null,"name":"Empresa William & Cia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1908-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Barcarola","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2396194,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antônio Cataldi","original_name":"Antônio Cataldi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"68755911f34e66dc8cc696a8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5421528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julio Ferrez","original_name":"Julio Ferrez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687558e563aef0f1d2f91c39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4344,"name":"musical"},{"id":181429,"name":"lost film"},{"id":264118,"name":"brazil"},{"id":355322,"name":"les contes d'hoffmann"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"L","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1908-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
