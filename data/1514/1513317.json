Naama, a popular nightclub singer, learns of her Jewish roots whilst around her, a series of violent Antisemitic attacks, orchestrated by the local Arab population, continues. Following an encounter with a shepherd and a Jewish boy whose parents were murdered, she joins a small group of Jews who are planning to move to the Holy Land (then-British Mandatory Palestine).  This is the first Israeli film to have been shot in technicolour, not to mention the first one to feature Mizrahi protagonists, specifically Yemeni Jews. Last but not least, it is a chance for viewers to watch the late grande dame of Israeli folk, Shoshana Damari, showcase her singing and acting skills on camera.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Homeland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1435675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shoshana Damari","original_name":"Shoshana Damari","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"68757202b150528ec0443850","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":583400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaike Ophir","original_name":"שייקה אופיר","popularity":0.3263,"profile_path":"/n5iYrbbi7eFMR1KVKC9M6DVAOza.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"687572159d4c645a08baa517","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1435674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sa'adia Damari","original_name":"Sa'adia Damari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"687572211106e94f6cc696f7","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
