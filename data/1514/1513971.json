Shot in evocative black-and-white and presented as a silent film, Mahsuri pays homage to early cinema and bangsawan theatre (a form of Malay operatic theatre), where folklore tales were brought to life on stage. The film’s soundtrack blends electronic music with traditional Malay sounds, creating a unique fusion that bridges past and present while reinforcing the tale’s enduring legacy.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mahsuri","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5566902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nashrudin Bin Shariffudin","original_name":"Nashrudin Bin Shariffudin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6876f8e79d9487ec47cf1489","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"FreshTake! 2025","release_date":"2025-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
