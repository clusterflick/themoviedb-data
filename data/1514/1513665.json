His next attempt, Ami, turns out even worse, because she steals his money and vanishes. Discouraged and considering retirement, Jin wanders into a bar called “Life Counseling”, where the bartender moonlights as a fortune-teller. The reading is grim: Mao, the beloved sister of a friendly yakuza, is destined to be defiled by a gigolo. When Jin finds Ami again, he uncovers the truth: she's not only a virgin but is being blackmailed by a gang that forces her to seduce and rob men. Now Jin must dive into the criminal underworld to save Ami… and maybe find redemption along the way.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/yglgaVdFLB6attT84rNesfIrSM7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91897,"logo_path":"/leIK67PDSwSkJtFgSvVbkP7EIm1.png","name":"Softgarage","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1995-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In the world of seduction, it’s all about luck and technique!
