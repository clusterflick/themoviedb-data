Whilst aching for something familiar, she meets a boy in the opposite-facing window of her hall who offers a warm smile, which she takes as an invitation to establish and evolve their newfound “connection” – all in her head.  When that is snatched away just as quickly as it came, Eden falls into despair at her fantasy breaking apart as she is forced to confront the reality of her obsession and her true feelings.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking In","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5566852,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fok En Yi","original_name":"Fok En Yi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6876f3cec6ef77dbd143cf3a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"FreshTake! 2025","release_date":"2025-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
