Dendrostalkers follows two sisters who attempt to film higher dimensional trees called \"dendrotopes\" to post them on an online forum. They find themselves taking risks to acquire the most daring footage and encountering a live dendrotope out in nature leads to mystifying consequences for one of the sisters.
