His brothers, Yonatan and Ido, who were evacuated along with the kibbutz community to a hotel in Shefayim, embarked on a continuous struggle to bring their younger brother back home. The family fought on all fronts, both in Israel and abroad, in an effort to prevent the tragedy that had already struck many of their fellow kibbutz members.  The film follows Yonatan, Ido, and the family with rare intimacy, on a journey that spans the country and the world—filled with angry protests, tense meetings, frustration, pain, and fear, alongside moments of grace, optimism, and humor.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zWQW6bHu8p2g7Cw8oK0rTfS8chk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56501,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sam Spiegel Film & Television School","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alon My Brother the Hero","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5563338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yonatan Shimriz","original_name":"Yonatan Shimriz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68750a72037b58e41a7057ad","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5563339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dikla Shimriz","original_name":"Dikla Shimriz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68750a85432b8e7299106712","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5563341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ido Shimriz","original_name":"Ido Shimriz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68750a8f0849184ac2ba3e77","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5563342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Avi Shimriz","original_name":"Avi Shimriz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68750a986ce9d985b0ed842c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5563343,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roni Shimriz","original_name":"Roni Shimriz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"68750aa4ee498f21056eb24e","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5563345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Omri Koren","original_name":"Omri Koren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68750ac18c85e0e5b9ed8466","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5563345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Omri Koren","original_name":"Omri Koren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68750ad0e0d3659080106469","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3840890,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lihy Gotlieb","original_name":"Lihy Gotlieb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68750adf33dc7bf3fb6eacad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5563345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Omri Koren","original_name":"Omri Koren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68750af1f4d7ae1acec5cd8f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5563349,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Noga Segal","original_name":"Noga Segal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68750b2e2ac14e0b4c1066f4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5563345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Omri Koren","original_name":"Omri Koren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68750f1842ca3ce553c5c2b6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1077,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ijD9B68qcGDEqn2MEks2yOyS8lI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1914},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1074,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cGWXmGTR8fzvPIK865zCjc4UHgA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1910},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":970,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6dnugQDS9enmwwPm9OHBHPbmYz6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1724},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1077,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1NqKioUJcPZfJLOsyyDCd9UEg7S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1915}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zWQW6bHu8p2g7Cw8oK0rTfS8chk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":536,"name":"israel"},{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":275377,"name":"gaza"},{"id":292185,"name":"hostages"},{"id":355307,"name":"kfar aza"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
