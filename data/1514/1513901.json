She accidentally kicks off one slipper to relieve her foot, but the guests' feet accidentally kick it away. Grace leaves the room in her stockinged foot, hoping to find the owner. Dick Evans, a young man, finds the slipper and tries to find the owner. He eventually finds Grace behind potted plants with one foot visible. Grace denies knowing about the slipper, and Dick devises a clever plan: he traps a mouse in a trap in the house, causing the ladies to climb chairs. Grace admits ownership of the slipper, allowing her to join in the whirl.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":246186,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edison Manufacturing Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Reluctant Cinderella","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1477031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsie MacLeod","original_name":"Elsie MacLeod","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/iLiXDRKMrTbEx66S8MR3NAE4yq3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Grace Walker","credit_id":"6876d17cc1084f2736f48b12","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Housman","original_name":"Arthur Housman","popularity":0.2911,"profile_path":"/2fPg5nQenEcivr5yAHDafZP76h9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dick Evans","credit_id":"6876d1907dcdeacf53a7a7c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5566751,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mrs. Walter Edwin","original_name":"Mrs. Walter Edwin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6876ddb444e6c351e1ba17a6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5566752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Emerson","original_name":"Betty Emerson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Grace's Maid","credit_id":"6876ddf648e8d32137cf140f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143821,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Bechtel","original_name":"William Bechtel","popularity":0.0957,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Orchestra Leader","credit_id":"6876de22742c0cf1decf1403","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1422732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward O’Connor","original_name":"Edward O’Connor","popularity":0.0407,"profile_path":"/qqe3cswsuupgC6LvKQoJBvBY2qb.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6876de352702b9f560ccdfaa","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1167806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cora Williams","original_name":"Cora Williams","popularity":0.1077,"profile_path":"/a1CNW1bXH49ZbXchbUZ32Az6J9l.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"The Cook","credit_id":"6876de504ed217bde3ba17bc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Tucker","original_name":"Richard Tucker","popularity":0.2994,"profile_path":"/hMHZdVgcSOyhONnAbXNVSKHDwhh.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Dinner Guest","credit_id":"6876de674ed217bde3ba17c0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5566760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margery Bonney Erskine","original_name":"Margery Bonney Erskine","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Mrs. Walker","credit_id":"6876dea6b45df0af446ab0ae","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3053454,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ida Williams","original_name":"Ida Williams","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"The Hostess","credit_id":"6876df15e4c107148843cecc","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1476271,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"C.J.
