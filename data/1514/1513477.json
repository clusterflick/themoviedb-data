Mario and Colate are a couple of friends who live in a small town. They share a dream: to travel to Madrid to form a musical group. Their arrival in a Madrid in cultural and social turmoil is accompanied by two drawbacks: they have no money and no record label is interested in their proposal. Gradually, however, they gradually get ahead. They get a job in a bar, \"El 33\", and meet a couple of nice musicians: Chakas and Guillermo. Together they form \"\"Rulé\"\", a group with which they win a contest that allows them to record their first single. Mario will know love at first sight when he meets María, a young actress. Colate, on the other hand, will get to know the dark world of drugs.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2E38aThK1YbcTgPjfRHlxE6TmD1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hoy No Me Puedo Levantar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j8md3Gzg3wDnGyCmAVPHbIvMW4d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2E38aThK1YbcTgPjfRHlxE6TmD1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
