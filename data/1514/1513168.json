I tried making it recognized that physical frames no longer exist in modern moving image production, paradoxically by constructing a virtual film strip in a digital space. I shot frames of 8mm films one by one with a digital single-lens reflex camera with a macro-cine copy. After digitizing the frames I arranged them lengthways one by one. Now it was possible to see the virtual long strip consisted of more than 100 frames through a virtual camera from any distance. I started from the farthest distance where the each frame can be recognized and gradually dived into the film strip. By doing so the work features that it is the most essential element of film that intermittent movement generate dynamism. I’d like to suggest that disappearance of physical frames is not a niche problem that matters only when producing experimental films but a problem that all kinds of moving image expression have in common","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jROc5HEFfJ25gDmb8UiItjRmj74.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If Frames Disappeared from the World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4268372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nomura Kenta","original_name":"Nomura Kenta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qQT624M2FmIXg03yGl2cOxdceZd.jpg","credit_id":"68752cdff34e66dc8cc6954f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1370,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jROc5HEFfJ25gDmb8UiItjRmj74.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":913}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
