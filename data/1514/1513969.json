Her family has also been dealing with a bedbug infestation. Despite her husband’s financial worries and her mother-in-law’s frustration at Aqil’s inability to speak Malay, Siti is bent on sending Aqil to a mainstream primary school.  However, Aqil fails the assessment despite his savant-like memory. Compounded with the recurrent bedbug infestation, Siti loses her temper at a distressed Aqil. It is only when Aqil makes a small act of kindness towards her and the bed bugs that Siti is touched by his empathy, finally putting down her pride as a mother and deciding to send Aqil to a special education school.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tilam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3144134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Ong Yin Meng","original_name":"Taylor Ong Yin Meng","popularity":0.0643,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6876f8950233c3523fba17e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"FreshTake! 2025","release_date":"2025-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
