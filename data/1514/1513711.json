The film explores the invisible line between who we were and who we are becoming — a distance that often begins with a small, ordinary object that suddenly brings the past into sharp focus. At its heart, this is a true story — a quiet tribute to a sister, and to the space that grew between two people once so close. It is about a relationship changed forever, and a home someone chose to stay in, no matter the cost.\r Through a dialogue with something as simple as a piece of fruit, the character reconnects with a moment of care, warmth, and protection — a sense of home now lost.\r For many modern Ukrainians, this is not just a metaphor. Homes have been physically destroyed, and what remains is memory.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vxeueBcWwjN1kFItK7mj8w7uU5j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":268090,"logo_path":null,"name":"HOLYWATER","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2025-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Distance
