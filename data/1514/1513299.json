Through the eyes of three girls on summer vacation, the film presents the achievements of young, beautiful, and advanced State of Israel.  The girls, Orna the Tel Avivian, Mazal and Lea the new immigrants, are three friends who study together in a youth village. Just before the vacation, they participate in a course at the Gadna where, in addition to learning commando skills, they also learn about responsibility and love for the land of Israel. From there, they go on vacation to Tel Aviv, a western metropolis in the heart of the Middle East, and spend time on the beach and in the museum. Their paths diverge from Tel Aviv, with Mazal and Orna traveling to Orna’s village to help with cotton picking, and Lea going to her parents’ house in Jerusalem, where she helps her father learn Hebrew. Afterwards, they reunite and arrive to watch the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":224557,"logo_path":null,"name":"Keren Hayesod","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1958-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Girls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Three Girls on A Holiday","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5564176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lasar Dunner","original_name":"Lasar Dunner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68756cc4ab6232969cc696e2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5564178,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lasar Dunner","original_name":"Lasar Dunner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68756d16ee94318831baa520","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5564176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lasar Dunner","original_name":"Lasar Dunner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68756d682a2d2c2d7f8e839b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1958-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
