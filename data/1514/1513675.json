He was reluctant to pursue the eunuch Wei Zhongxian, so he took his family to hide in Lushan, changed his name to Sun Qian, and set up a hall to teach apprentices. Among them, the love, friendship and patriotism between people, ghosts and foxes are all together here. In the play, there are human beings who do not seek progress, and there are also fox fairies who are dedicated to learning, highlighting the weaknesses of human nature. It is said that people and foxes are not representatives of loyalty and treachery.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1vaGBgYv14CLwONEvcqVj9N0Zuz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dark Tale","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.749,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"cn","file_path":"/1vaGBgYv14CLwONEvcqVj9N0Zuz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1320}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
