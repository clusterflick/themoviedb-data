The film opens with deep shadows cast by the Chiapas sun. As the marketplace fills with people, the film is transformed into a flat plane of colors—vivid greens, hot pinks, bold turquoise, blazing reds… Within this flat plane, the viewer can discern representational forms—a woman’s glossy braid, a straw basket, a humble sandal, a child’s face… This is a beautiful, loving film.” (Karen Treanor)","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"San Cristobal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1440238,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Jennings","original_name":"Jim Jennings","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/msfx2Tb9rP4KSAHI09SICAg4w9R.jpg","credit_id":"6875cacc34027403fd732fe5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
