Through the practice of drawing ethnographic objects at the Manchester Museum, it reflects on how we gain knowledge, understanding, and a sense of self by seeing, collecting, categorising, naming, and creating. The film invites viewers to reconsider how interaction with objects can transform perception and meaning.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2025-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"See it, say it, draw it","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5564812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"José Luis Cote","original_name":"José Luis Cote","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6875c735bed3f6135373302a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
