It follows the journey of two small-town rappers, JRGRETZKY (Joe Redmond) and Margiela Sorcerer (Luis Angeles) over several years as they attempt to find their sound and create an album with the help of their friends, fellow rapper CashStarChris (Chris Gnos) and filmmaker Jamdry (Jamdry Rodrigues). The result is a kaleidoscopic odyssey, a 30-minute long visual album examining the boundless limits of adolescent creativity and ambition.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/nvFQ8M4sOVbOuatRCGFVfX2OUJL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":268023,"logo_path":null,"name":"CASH$TARGENESIS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United
