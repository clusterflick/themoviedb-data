The film operates with a hardly perceptible and  slow and regular zoom in on Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, where the evening ritual of lowering the state flag is in pro-  gress. The transition from a city panorama to the action at this historically and politically charged location is accompa-  nied by a change in atmosphere, both through the onset of darkness and a shift in perception from mere viewing to ob-  serving.
