No copy of Um Crime Sensacional survives, only 1 image from the film is known, which was placed in the magazine \"Cinemin\".  It is not known whether the film was a \"sound\" film, that is, with actors dubbing themselves live behind the screen based on already recorded images. The only proof that the film could be a sound film is a 1913 song called \"O Crime de Paula Matos\" by Joaquim Pacheco, which may have been used in the sound versions of the film. This song is currently lost.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":267998,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brasil Filme","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1913-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sensational Crime","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"O Crime de Paula Matos","type":"Original"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3676965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antônio Ramos","original_name":"Antônio Ramos","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Augusto Henriques","credit_id":"6875636f21e3ee91468e4e3d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5564124,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Aroso","original_name":"Mario Aroso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Adolfo Freire","credit_id":"687563c4eacd3eb7ce4437c2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1287681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alberto Botelho","original_name":"Alberto Botelho","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68756242e7aa74697abaa510","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5242892,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Paulino Botelho","original_name":"Paulino Botelho","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6875625c5ab932e214c696a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5242892,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Paulino Botelho","original_name":"Paulino Botelho","popularity":0.0314,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68756273ab6232969cc69695","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4648103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luiz Rocha","original_name":"Luiz Rocha","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6875629ac4b67c0577f91bb6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0186007","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"L","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1913-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
