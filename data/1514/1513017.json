Arrebato was the film that forecast the end of the movida, a dark and harrowing reel whose history and intra-history are intimately linked. Arrebato acts as a premonition of the director’s own life. Just like his actors, Zulueta will end up being brought down by drugs and the cinema and, like them, will also disappear.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/flZW3cuMqZQmsQvBPZiEIaYXIby.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Last Rapture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37513,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Iván Zulueta","original_name":"Iván Zulueta","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":"/eVlM4f8epamM60bpMq2OC4uCpVi.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"6874e42b0fe24ad4afa98a71","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jaime Chávarri","original_name":"Jaime Chávarri","popularity":0.2268,"profile_path":"/7W1ax4s7l31seVqSndufvcdjulS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6874e3d0a1aab494bc705991","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eusebio Poncela","original_name":"Eusebio Poncela","popularity":0.1926,"profile_path":"/pCbXRk44XYJzWDzYybAco5dlGF7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6874e3e46ce9d985b0ed8342","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cecilia Roth","original_name":"Cecilia Roth","popularity":0.7068,"profile_path":"/4icHsZvHy0ZnDGF2kovjNLuDQEM.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6874e3ede56c47a84c6eab17","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marta Fernández Muro","original_name":"Marta Fernández Muro","popularity":0.1769,"profile_path":"/eXA6SZKlQJRXbnxuS3YltcMpFBB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6874e3db2d3af77c9cc5c92e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4490648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Montenegro","original_name":"Virginia Montenegro","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6874e4ceee498f21056eb154","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1820926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Astiarraga","original_name":"Carlos Astiarraga","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6874e3c6900a7bccc4ed837c","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5563020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paco Hoyos","original_name":"Paco Hoyos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6874e501d87ac80c75ba3cf6","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1778520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos F.
