Lyuba Yamskaya ‚Äì Madame","overview":"‚ÄúMadame‚Äù is a lyrical ballad in which SanMinor appears as a sincere romantic and poet. Inspired by a woman who awakens bright feelings in him, he expresses his emotions through images, tenderness and adoration. The track is built as a poetic dialogue - a declaration of love, designed in a sublime, almost theatrical style. Every stroke is important here: from the light touch to the metaphor of the ‚Äúchariot‚Äù and the ‚Äúhearth‚Äù.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ceFvT2oJ8KLRqczefUarL97ApKS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":267963,"logo_path":null,"name":"SanMinor Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"P—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"SanMinor ft.
