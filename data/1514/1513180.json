Now living in exile in Paris, she works as a caregiver for Georges, a diplomat nearing the end of his life. Within the confines of his opulent apartment, filled with relics of colonial memory, Leila begins to experience ghostly visitations from her late husband and son. At first tender, these apparitions gradually take on a sinister form, blurring the lines between trauma and madness, memory and haunting. As the echo of distant bombs returns, the walls between Georges’s apartment and Leila’s lost home begin to collapse.","popularity":0.0929,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":85063,"logo_path":"/68hy1l1EWAVzzwrxIt8uAIwYTkw.png","name":"La Prod","origin_country":"MA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"},{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Shelter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hiam Abbass","original_name":"Hiam Abbass","popularity":1.7289,"profile_path":"/hkzC5aJKTiuCchBpybaHDVngYZW.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Leila","credit_id":"687530de9fc67cab17f91ab7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Talal Selhami","original_name":"Talal Selhami","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/iOiSytBLlHpQ7E817ghi3UHs8Be.jpg","credit_id":"68753095c1298858e6f91aa4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2480507,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lamia Chraibi","original_name":"Lamia Chraibi","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687530a83c6c487886c69558","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1094212,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Talal Selhami","original_name":"Talal Selhami","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/iOiSytBLlHpQ7E817ghi3UHs8Be.jpg","credit_id":"6875313ed9c86c1791f91a85","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16433504","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":162846,"name":"ghost"},{"id":256693,"name":"syrian civil war"},{"id":295907,"name":"psychological horror"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
