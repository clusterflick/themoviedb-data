Using The Sims, a sandbox game that allows players to freely interact with the game world, the dating experiences of two app users are reconstructed, blurring the boundaries between digital simulation and reality. By merging real-life interactions with digital platform elements to create a dystopian-like reality, the film reflects the gamified nature of modern dating. Through this lens, Love Quest questions whether something as delicate as love can truly be found online.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Quest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4865726,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevia Tan","original_name":"Kevia Tan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6876f7c081bf3d10d2052245","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","release_dates":[{"certification":"NC16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"FreshTake! 2025","release_date":"2025-07-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
