Outside the surf-fishing community, the east end of New York's Long Island, The Hamptons, Sag Harbor, Amagansett, is simply the legendary summer home of the world's elite, and those who aspire to be. On the 'east end' you can stroll shoulder to shoulder with Hollywood royalty, captains of industry and the masters of Wall Street. As summer draws to a close and both the leaves and the mercury start to fall, those who came east to be seen are replaced by the legions who come to disappear into the night, and into the rocks, in pursuit of a trophy fish, and an even bigger tale.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Montauk Rocks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5563958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Siberry","original_name":"Richard Siberry","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"687545f1c7bb4e862a443723","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928952,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Eric Milano","original_name":"Eric Milano","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/lqyT4SWzhz4W6EOpDpgGzLOkg9Z.jpg","credit_id":"687546022686252cb644370a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2233650","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
