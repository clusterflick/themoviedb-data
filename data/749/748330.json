Along with Schwizgebel, \"Patchwork\" included the talents of filmmakers Claude Luyet, Daniel Suter, Gerald Poussin and Manuel Otero. \"Pirouette\" combines a simple drawing of a figure with photographs, cut-outs from magazines and samples of cloth. A prominent motif of this collage mix is a drawn male face slightly inspired by pop-art.","popularity":0.0611,"poster_path":"/AhN7QCWcCrsyrHqTujZMhesaYy3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pirouette","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1100023,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Schwizgebel","original_name":"Georges Schwizgebel","popularity":0.0765,"profile_path":"/9hixdcBCCwqYtfc1l7rF7N6WpZa.jpg","credit_id":"5f73e0a8350398003798a8af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AhN7QCWcCrsyrHqTujZMhesaYy3.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1365},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1197,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1CY1SKmu9qtm8q5GKLweAVJdH1H.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":798}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
