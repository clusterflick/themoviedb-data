An experiment in machine learning, Tay was given the persona and colloquial speech patterns of a 19-year-old millennial in order to interact with the world. During her brief online existence, she was aggressively trolled by users on social media, evolving into a racist, misogynistic, homophobe that made alt-right slurs and pledged allegiance to Hitler. Tay became the embodiment of the worst traits of humanity, and after less than 16 hours she was promptly terminated by Microsoft.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"i’m here to learn so :))))))","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2798722,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jemima  Wyman","original_name":"Jemima  Wyman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f753e8519675700379b93e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1555302,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zach Blas","original_name":"Zach Blas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f753e5291b5300038918402","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
