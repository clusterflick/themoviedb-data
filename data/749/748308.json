Since the death of her mother, Lilah has begrudgingly taken on her mum’s role in the family home. Frustrated by her inherently obstinate father and her brother’s legalistic faith, Lilah makes a plan to run away with Jimmy, the 22 year old guy she has been seeing in secret. Torn between the call of a life without imposed values and the importance of her culture, Lilah makes the choice to flee, putting her family’s forgiveness to the ultimate test.","popularity":0.1358,"poster_path":"/lv5ZR3Fi2PcCsmLX3ckNItXwiyk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"FORGIVENESS, FAMILY AND ONE GIRL’S JOURNEY TO ADULTHOOD.","title":"Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2174483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amita Suman","original_name":"Amita Suman","popularity":0.2671,"profile_path":"/sNvhzsyttm39LPaANbwOMMmeXh4.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lilah","credit_id":"609ea496e635710079ec3f12","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2797301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Hayter","original_name":"Edward Hayter","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jimmy","credit_id":"5f73d6253ff2df00384f0e57","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":218347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Anwar","original_name":"Marc Anwar","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Asif","credit_id":"5f73d630d388ae0037bccded","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2797302,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Karim","original_name":"Adam Karim","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nasif","credit_id":"5f73d639fea0d7003509dfd9","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3090356,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Todd","original_name":"David Todd","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ea72901432500795c9fe7","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3090350,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Christian Kinde","original_name":"Christian Kinde","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ea63b5b370d005702d0a0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3090358,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Neil Fergusson","original_name":"Neil Fergusson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ea8045b370d00418b1bed","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2231144,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarmad Varraich","original_name":"Sarmad Varraich","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"609ea684807298005847f067","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2047919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stefan Kopiecki","original_name":"Stefan Kopiecki","popularity":0.0927,"profile_path":"/zD9Dw31m68uYkpJwDuL4IBi92hi.jpg","credit_id":"609ea75de63571005973e27e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2797299,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Kinde","original_name":"Christian Kinde","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f73d60c21621b00352b1fcd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1638333,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Anna MacDonald","original_name":"Anna MacDonald","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dc55e96df33183cbdd130a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4948128,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Morris","original_name":"Paul Morris","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e9eaecb66746dd790afdbc","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7220364","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nuS16qKzCRviA3dlckCiAiSB6Xc.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lv5ZR3Fi2PcCsmLX3ckNItXwiyk.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jC2pFh0loXgK3chYtUcPLFl91FL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/egVl43TsMS4lRzK9tPEPPzazMI0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DC Shorts Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Daughter - Trailer","key":"334008352","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-05-03T16:12:31.000Z","id":"609ea573f5c824002991c6e6"}]}}}
