Memories accost him-memories of his school days, of loved ones long gone, of wonder, callousness, and defeat. The painful invasion gives rise to a series reflections on the limits of cinema and the poverty, and inescapability, of the life of the mind. No matter how much he has tried to change, the young man-who may or may not be the filmmaker himself-always returns to the same places, same questions, same faces, same recollections-the same nails in his brain.","popularity":0.1824,"poster_path":"/jLqBuztTBKTCvPfiuC5Ms2zfDeJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125028,"logo_path":"/d4r2X3ljb2LcDGNN2RDZT1Mhkxl.png","name":"Ucqar Film","origin_country":"AZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","name":"Azerbaijan"}],"release_date":"2020-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Azərbaycan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nails in My Brain","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2175585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hilal Baydarov","original_name":"Hilal Baydarov","popularity":0.1687,"profile_path":"/1ptIlxNcKUUqvI7E61l4N0vtuzw.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f763368fea0d700360e05ac","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2175585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hilal Baydarov","original_name":"Hilal Baydarov","popularity":0.1687,"profile_path":"/1ptIlxNcKUUqvI7E61l4N0vtuzw.jpg","credit_id":"5f763372156cc700354d4c73","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2175585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hilal Baydarov","original_name":"Hilal Baydarov","popularity":0.1687,"profile_path":"/1ptIlxNcKUUqvI7E61l4N0vtuzw.jpg","credit_id":"5f763385944a570034c43d28","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2175585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hilal Baydarov","original_name":"Hilal Baydarov","popularity":0.1687,"profile_path":"/1ptIlxNcKUUqvI7E61l4N0vtuzw.jpg","credit_id":"5f76339129c6260037754097","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2175585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hilal Baydarov","original_name":"Hilal Baydarov","popularity":0.1687,"profile_path":"/1ptIlxNcKUUqvI7E61l4N0vtuzw.jpg","credit_id":"5f76339b29c626003674e123","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2175585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hilal Baydarov","original_name":"Hilal Baydarov","popularity":0.1687,"profile_path":"/1ptIlxNcKUUqvI7E61l4N0vtuzw.jpg","credit_id":"5f7633a53429ff0038ac8ff6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11779178","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2714,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jLqBuztTBKTCvPfiuC5Ms2zfDeJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinéma du Réel","release_date":"2020-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Nails in My Brain (Beynimdəki Mismarlar) [Trailer] - 2020","key":"LMIEdIxxJts","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-02-22T10:58:46.000Z","id":"5f7634183429ff0036ae3069"}]}}}
