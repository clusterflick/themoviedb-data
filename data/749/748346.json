Marlene became involved in the fight for justice at a young age, when Steven was arrested at 14 and sentenced to be hung. When Steven was released from prison ten years later, she fell in love with him. Marlene's story is a story of hiding, living under an assumed name and protecting her children. He was free, but now she was in prison. Through it all Marlene was determined that Steven would get justice, that they would find light in the darkness, a darkness that buried the truth. Surrounded by boxes of files Marlene found a world of lies, cover-ups, and secrets.","popularity":0.6747,"poster_path":"/7c588ryGu1RXW5H2KYiCaZGjoUC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true story of the woman that fought to exonerate Steven Truscott.","title":"Marlene","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristin Booth","original_name":"Kristin Booth","popularity":0.3382,"profile_path":"/366SBcUxgrh8374uNetOYlP9fo0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Marlene","credit_id":"62596d883acd2016291c2b70","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Bryk","original_name":"Greg Bryk","popularity":0.6716,"profile_path":"/1I3SxKFvQSam6KOMT4j5f0nFxRg.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Steven Truscott","credit_id":"62596da8e0ec511959244e56","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":584542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Sarah Stone","original_name":"Julia Sarah Stone","popularity":0.2688,"profile_path":"/6PV9ZU6Xv7w1N2Pb8R9t9V9pIIa.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Marlene (Young Adult)","credit_id":"62596e48e0ec51195a3d988f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1844055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dempsey Bryk","original_name":"Dempsey Bryk","popularity":0.3675,"profile_path":"/hAjyeu2sYNSkrZtS3SMfWRXNHqT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Steven (Young Adult)","credit_id":"62596eee3acd2016291c328b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29880,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maxim Roy","original_name":"Maxim Roy","popularity":0.6381,"profile_path":"/tIBHuZKm2Mzg25IcbDLYfeE7rOT.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Isabel LaBourdais","credit_id":"62596fb75e120012c60d64d8","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3486379,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tamarra Lessard","original_name":"Tamarra Lessard","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/7tUNrEA7qG2B9neAMxoexfrV3ll.jpg","credit_id":"6592ff19069f0e5ce32110dc","department":"Camera","job":"Second Assistant \"A\" Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1243080,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wendy Hill-Tout","original_name":"Wendy Hill-Tout","popularity":0.0931,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f73eb22223e20003981f7a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1243080,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wendy Hill-Tout","original_name":"Wendy Hill-Tout","popularity":0.0931,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fae14d1e263bb004291b513","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2854515,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Cathy Ostlere","original_name":"Cathy Ostlere","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fae14e10d9f5a0041057c7a","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12762096","wikidata_id":"Q106492979","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iC3z9ppFIThEnC6NdKtl1n1ruS5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7c588ryGu1RXW5H2KYiCaZGjoUC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d9C4KOFhCR0qmNdLkBoxseQSEMF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1300}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"M","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CIFF","release_date":"2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"CIFF","release_date":"2020-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"M","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-06-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer","key":"pJE2SjToUFk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2022-06-03T18:27:04.000Z","id":"636b8f0121621b00777bfd43"}]}}}
