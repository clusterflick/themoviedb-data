Hitler and Mussolini quickly joined the fight on the side of the fascist military. In response, and against the wishes of the U.S. government, about 80 American women joined over 2700 of their countrymen to volunteer for the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. This film is composed of interviews with and excerpts from the letters, journals, and published writings of some of these women, as well as of supporters and sympathizers including Martha Gellhorn, Eleanor Roosevelt, Virginia Cowles, Josephine Herbst, and Dorothy Parker.","popularity":0.0481,"poster_path":"/6GOn40qqLKMBNgQyqCuU7QyVonS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Into the Fire: American Women in the Spanish Civil War","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3877376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Gellhorn","original_name":"Martha Gellhorn","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679da79e7b4153a3b99539f8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5217323,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Hutchins","original_name":"Evelyn Hutchins","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679da7d7ac5a7951b9cb3758","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5218369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Silverstein Blanc","original_name":"Esther Silverstein Blanc","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679e5a970d19f30ac1954ba0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5218371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Davidow","original_name":"Ruth Davidow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679e5aadb06437a4ee26300c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5218373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Freeman Feinberg","original_name":"Helen Freeman Feinberg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679e5ac2a1e33c408a26180c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5218376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salaria Kea O'Reilly","original_name":"Salaria Kea O'Reilly","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679e5b2580082986c8cb4a5c","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5218377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Celia Greenspan Seborer","original_name":"Celia Greenspan Seborer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679e5b4f7ebb0614ff262c63","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5218378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Goldin Speigel","original_name":"Irene Goldin Speigel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"679e5b6e04cb6f41b9cb4bf3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5218387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Ryan","original_name":"Victoria Ryan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Virginia Coweles (Voice)","credit_id":"679e5c14176fdb2244cb5325","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5218394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Ronconi","original_name":"Amanda Ronconi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Lini de Vries (Voice)","credit_id":"679e5c45b06437a4ee263047","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5218397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meg Howrey","original_name":"Meg Howrey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Martha Gellhorn (Voice)","credit_id":"679e5c8db06437a4ee263076","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5218398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Traub","original_name":"Claudia Traub","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Celia Greenspan (Voice)","credit_id":"679e5cc77ebb0614ff262ce7","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5218399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"M.
