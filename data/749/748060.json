While working on some of the most popular titles of Italian cinema, he comes across a strange figure almost hidden among the extras -  a man wearing a bowler hat and looking directly toward the camera, perhaps even at Marcello himself! He finds the same man in many other films from different movie ages. He grows obsessed with this figure, even if it seems Marcello is the only one who can see him.","popularity":0.0692,"poster_path":"/7Bf6eFm3LaQ5gB2mnegk6gk7TUu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148864,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinephonie","origin_country":""},{"id":63637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Small Moves","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2017-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man in the Movie Camera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Triestino","original_name":"Paolo Triestino","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":"/C5XSaWwigBd5wzhad3U2pA8hau.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f732f35ef48890037f8762d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurizio Merli","original_name":"Maurizio Merli","popularity":0.3244,"profile_path":"/bwhoMXH9hFjaNVGnOgfA0Sn2Ay6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f732f421d78f20036703ab4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2796455,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Kiriakidou","original_name":"Sophie Kiriakidou","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f732f55fea0d70033ff0501","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2968327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roberta Crolle","original_name":"Roberta Crolle","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"601fafa7458199003da53913","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2189817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierluigi Ferrero","original_name":"Pierluigi Ferrero","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/iTgES2av5cuJSf5m4APGBc65IfA.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f732f63196757003794d35a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2796454,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michéle De Angelis","original_name":"Michéle De Angelis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f732e96ef48890036fc097d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1724134,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michéle De Angelis","original_name":"Michéle De Angelis","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f732e9eef48890039f716e7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9021208","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/7Bf6eFm3LaQ5gB2mnegk6gk7TUu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1142},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1424,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/2dx4dmSrhjREzwvtB34Dtm0OaLK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":949},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1376,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/lYaPWO6ESgo3kDyTAincSu1l1ui.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":917}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
