His work causes a public outcry: it attracts the attention of religious activists of the \"God's punishment\" organization, officials and journalists. As a result, the painting is removed from the exhibition, and the activists first attack, and then set fire to the artist's studio. The painting is saved, but Ivan faces a criminal case, so together with the curator of the exhibition, he goes to the Pen & Paper Bar Association to find protection and get advice on what to do next in this situation. Lawyers are preparing a defense strategy, and a bewildered artist, who by chance found himself in the epicenter of an absurd religious and cultural conflict, confronts musician Sergei Shnurov at the door of the college. Who seems to need help too.","popularity":0.274,"poster_path":"/84MIEctC3bpBumcQCqDZ78Cl8oR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141027,"logo_path":null,"name":"КА Pen & Paper","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Painting","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Kartina","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuriy Chursin","original_name":"Юрий Чурсин","popularity":0.3035,"profile_path":"/xouMeVM2xqSslc7oI29VcUUFA2i.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f7360bed40d4c003864189e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Igor Mirkurbanov","original_name":"Игорь Миркурбанов","popularity":0.2351,"profile_path":"/aKK8IdM4ccKElRzYpZsNNyX8r1V.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f7360c4fea0d7003604933b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1587232,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Antipp","original_name":"Maria Antipp","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/zrUfBaIWJO5sylubxV1CvUASkEQ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f7360c935039800349363bf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavel Maykov","original_name":"Павел Майков","popularity":0.4456,"profile_path":"/9xefUeeVpFhaBLZwYqrNQfnEsYi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f7360cfef48890039f79ad9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":226708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrey Rudensky","original_name":"Андрей Руденский","popularity":0.3077,"profile_path":"/2DTRIFPtuwAYldwabmKOioWNDEI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f7360d6d40d4c0039668443","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2796770,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Olga Beshley","original_name":"Olga Beshley","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f736121d55e4d003796b3b2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2319266,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sergey Kalvarsky","original_name":"Сергей Кальварский","popularity":0.0864,"profile_path":"/aYItkk67ZtPOpJl0WfyKpdvGnqW.jpg","credit_id":"5f7360f0ef48890038f5e28e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/84MIEctC3bpBumcQCqDZ78Cl8oR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"In Love with Art International Film Festival","release_date":"2019-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
