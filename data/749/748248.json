This 83-year-old landlady’s life on the family farm with adjoining guest house in the Upper Palatinate has been marked by constant hard work. A life that her granddaughters Monika and Hannah never wanted to lead. Now, the deeply indebted farm is on the brink of collapse. Despite having an academic background and contrary to her intentions, Monika, in her early thirties, decides to give up her modern life and save the family business. The two women join forces and give themselves a year to sort out the farm’s problems.","popularity":0.41,"poster_path":"/b66VPM1ATNfzQdz6yaTcGiU3cHf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65263,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zum Goldenen Lamm Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"80.000 Schnitzel","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monika Schweier","original_name":"Monika Schweier","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f7a3adcfdfc9f0036aa4c8d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803494,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Berta Zenefels","original_name":"Berta Zenefels","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f7a3aea223e200038be7b1c","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2062398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannah Schweier","original_name":"Hannah Schweier","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/zsKiYoQVymJVm0pYbIgsaDuqwsY.jpg","credit_id":"5f73aa5f156cc700374440ea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2062398,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannah Schweier","original_name":"Hannah Schweier","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/zsKiYoQVymJVm0pYbIgsaDuqwsY.jpg","credit_id":"5f73aa5621621b00332a1e34","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1843964,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Stefanie Reinhard","original_name":"Stefanie Reinhard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a3b14197de4003877f8b8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803495,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Romy Steyer","original_name":"Romy Steyer","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a3b2442bf01003805c20a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1330660,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stefan Sporbert","original_name":"Stefan Sporbert","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a3b43021cee00363823f7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2803496,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ella Zwietnig","original_name":"Ella Zwietnig","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a3b3743cd5400374f86e8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185220,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Burkhard Althoff","original_name":"Burkhard Althoff","popularity":0.0606,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f7a3b4f42bf01003805c294","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9328476","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/b66VPM1ATNfzQdz6yaTcGiU3cHf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Cij855F3G8HsGMnrglItr8U5AB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1131}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4932,"name":"farm"},{"id":74,"name":"germany"},{"id":3009,"name":"farm worker"},{"id":1946,"name":"restaurant"},{"id":172972,"name":"old woman"},{"id":234377,"name":"traditional food"},{"id":241669,"name":"new generation"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Zurich Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
