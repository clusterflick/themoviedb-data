The first victim of the fumes is a dog that is seated beside the table, and when the fellow blows his breath on the animal he falls over unconscious from the effects. Next he prostrates a street cleaner and a painter perched on a ladder, as well as a woman in charge of a newsstand. They all succumb and fall over unconscious on the ground. He enters the subway and meets a man coming up the stairs, and when the latter gets a whiff of the garlic he too, goes down in a heap. Entering the car in the underground road he proceeds to waft the strong odor over the passengers, with the effect that each in turn goes down and out on the floor of the coach. When he reaches the next station he alights, leaving the car looking more like a hospital than anything.","popularity":0.1401,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1908-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jim is Fond of Garlic","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Jim Is Fond of Garlic","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1167399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"André Deed","original_name":"André Deed","popularity":0.3646,"profile_path":"/prazmRnbuIUeHO6McGOUQHDUeOd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Boireau","credit_id":"5f74359c156cc7003546a733","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1268213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Monca","original_name":"Georges Monca","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f743589b7abb500350fa5a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0429696","wikidata_id":"Q18147155","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1908-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Boireau a mangé de l'ail (1908) Jim Is Fond of Garlic (Pathé)","key":"3GaQlKzrB-0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-09-23T20:24:40.000Z","id":"67011e6c1592ef1ba9854bc7"}]}}}
