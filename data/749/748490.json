The latter has been using rather unusual, very successful but unapproved methods of treatment. In addition, he enjoys great popularity among the population of the Totes Gebirge. To help him do his job, Dr. Andacht has been given a doctor, a masseur and an operating room aid. All of them are to be rehabilitated too. Their undertaking is a disastrous flop.","popularity":0.0945,"poster_path":"/bknhlDtq2Px5uuWnvKVgZKmWFbq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141064,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hochschule für Musik und darstellende Kunst, Wien","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1983-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parodontose Now","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2797933,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Manfred M.
