Marie is once again confronted with the early death of her mother and the excessive demands of her conservative father. He has no understanding for her and deports her to a Catholic girls' boarding school. A youth characterized by constant rebellion against the mustiness of the post-war years and against a society that expects one thing above all from girls: to smile nicely into the camera and under no circumstances direct the film themselves!","popularity":0.2232,"poster_path":"/Tp87x91hU6GHhewxXBgOi9wlBx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97124,"logo_path":"/yPMc0cRnUqpbXWHavXgLuPXyfHk.png","name":"W-film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":31138,"logo_path":"/aI6mMcZgLUSxlssAtBbE6mRaR7x.png","name":"Coin
