Five witnesses were present in the 77 square metre space when Halit was shot twice in the head. Remarkably, an undercover agent from the German secret service was among those present in the cafe at the time of the murder, yet he claimed not to have heard gunfire nor noticed the body slumped at the front desk. A rigorous counter-investigation by London-based research agency Forensic Architecture inspired the Australian composer and director Ben Frost to write the opera The Murder of Halit Yozgat. With his unconventional combination of sound art, electronic music and dark metal, Frost brings a performance in which a sound nobody heard irrevocably ties all of those present together.","popularity":0.1121,"poster_path":"/x6HCimiO216kM2mFUulL2XEf2iW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2020-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Murder of Halit Yozgat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"Deutschland","title":"Der Mordfall Halit Yozgat","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1697833,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Trevor Tweeten","original_name":"Trevor Tweeten","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f758f8458efd30034ae7299","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":966481,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ben Frost","original_name":"Ben Frost","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/AjKLD8LxNVcfRRBwrISJGPLqN3R.jpg","credit_id":"5f758f5c156cc7003847744f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":966481,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ben Frost","original_name":"Ben Frost","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/AjKLD8LxNVcfRRBwrISJGPLqN3R.jpg","credit_id":"5f758fad21621b003331127f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x6HCimiO216kM2mFUulL2XEf2iW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"premiered at Kunstfestspiele Herrenhausen in Hanover, Germany","release_date":"2020-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
