'THIS IS YARRA' follows the story of two boys from the Yarra Wild Beasts as they prepare for the South Sudanese Australian National Basketball Association (SSANBA) Tournament, with the hope of taking home their first trophy for the junior team. In Australia's sociopolitical climate of fear-mongering and sensationalism, where headlines decrying \"African Gangs\" have become commonplace, the short documentary 'THIS IS YARRA' offers an alternative narrative of empowerment from the ground up.tHIS","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6zlTqB58dZs7TtQaj5kp73BxuoK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Is Yarra","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2309817,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lydia Rui","original_name":"Lydia Rui","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd638800e0a262df9cb0ad8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8010480","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6zlTqB58dZs7TtQaj5kp73BxuoK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":707}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
