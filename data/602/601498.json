Among the genocide practices described were the death flights -- the dropping of tortured living prisoners into the RÃ­o de la Plata or the Atlantic Ocean. Scilingo specifies the model that was used in the flights he participated in: an Electra. Of the eight Electras belonging to the Argentine Navy, only the three bought in 1973 could have been used in the flights that Scilingo describes. Those planes are at present in Argentina. This film searches cartographically the traces of those planes.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2016-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"5-T-2 Ushuaia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483062,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonathan Perel","original_name":"Jonathan Perel","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd57e42c3a36869dafda8bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"Bienal de la Imagen en Movimiento","release_date":"2016-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
