Using the images recorded on a cruise ship made by his parents, the author invokes a dystopian society where the problems of collective coexistence are solved by an algorithm, and where the prohibition of abortion is compensated by a law that allows parents to prosecute their children if, at the age of 30, they have not fulfilled the expectations placed on them. In La Veda, the author’s voice-over derives on his fatherly figures, stripping them with brutal honesty under the gaze of an existential void shaped like a virus and with the only testimony of a video camera that is treated as if it were a newcomer to the world.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/oodDrNnDlusxKmT0enajdJkEY1R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2018-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Veda","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2310486,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paco Chanivet","original_name":"Paco Chanivet","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd743eb9251417c3fcf1ed1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":787,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/oodDrNnDlusxKmT0enajdJkEY1R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":556}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
