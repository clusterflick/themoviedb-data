In the year of liberation in 1945, 'KPK Musical Troupe' won popularity with the duo of Lee Nan-young and Kim Hae-song, but Kim got kidnapped by North Korea. During the Korean War, Lee made Korea’s first girl vocal group ‘Kim Sisters’ with her daughters Suk-ja, Ae-ja and her niece Min-ja who inherited their parents’ musical talent. Thanks to Lee’s desperate effort and intense training, ‘Kim Sisters’ gained popularity at the American 8th Army base. They got all the way to Las Vegas, USA for the first time as Asians, showing strong appeal to American public. Min-ja of ‘Kim Sisters’ is still working as a singer in Budapest, Hungary. The audience can meet the three shy girls who fluently sang songs in English without even knowing the language, through the memories of Min-ja in the film.","popularity":0.2074,"poster_path":"/pOnytmsYJtsG1A8QGYLAkpYy5UN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118128,"logo_path":null,"name":"INDELINE","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":116303,"logo_path":null,"name":"eye m","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2017-01-26","revenue":5041,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Try to Remember","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3056483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Min-ja Kim","original_name":"김민자","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"647f64dd17497300fb3cad53","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3056482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Suk-ja Kim","original_name":"김숙자","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"647f64f1174973011872d23a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3056484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ae-ja Kim","original_name":"김애자","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"647f6505aede5900a97b33de","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3535364,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nan-yeong Lee","original_name":"Nan-yeong Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"647f6523cf4b8b00c3d3e50d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4099816,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Hae-song","original_name":"Kim Hae-song","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"647f6575cf4b8b00e2d767bd","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2307849,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Im Jihyun","original_name":"Im Jihyun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd2f1140e0a264a9502663f","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2307848,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Eligio Kim","original_name":"Eligio Kim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd2f0f70e0a2631b8063b7c","department":"Camera","job":"Digital Imaging Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2307836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Dae-hyun","original_name":"Kim Dae-hyun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd2eeaec3a36836c1e67bf7","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2307851,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jo Eunbyeol","original_name":"Jo Eunbyeol","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd2f1449251417cce2f398d","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2307852,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jung Sooyeon","original_name":"Jung Sooyeon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd2f17d925141045631863d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2307836,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Dae-hyun","original_name":"Kim Dae-hyun","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd2ee95925141207826f8c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2307850,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"JEONG Hea-yon","original_name":"JEONG Hea-yon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd2f12cc3a36840cfe03f37","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7520904","wikidata_id":"Q65241097","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nDB9F52f0z1iPERETI3WBnHudDm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1061,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/vZZBCelmkF522ZunCMDgU0m8kXA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":740},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pOnytmsYJtsG1A8QGYLAkpYy5UN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":186799,"name":"girl group"},{"id":225273,"name":"k-pop"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jecheon International Music & Film Festival","release_date":"2015-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
