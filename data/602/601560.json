A sense of transgression is in the air – the woman is, after all, trespassing – and she finds herself constantly being watched by several men who, we assume, oversee the disused property. This vague threat notwithstanding, she projects scraps of old footage, creating a freeform narrative all her own, breathing new life into forgotten artifacts.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":"/zuznGr6P2WSdYCfOvXlWEoJsqNT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Have Always Been Watching You","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2309636,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rawda Al-Thani","original_name":"Rawda Al-Thani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd5d40a0e0a265dee637b07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zuznGr6P2WSdYCfOvXlWEoJsqNT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
