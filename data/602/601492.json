The results inevitably show confusion and angered disillusionment. The new ideas and ways, never allowed time to evolve and produce positive results, were smothered for the sake of convenience and convention. The film is ultimately a nostalgic reminiscence of the Sixties.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/cB07MlCtu6m2ezfhhSTguFwkVNH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rochdale College 1970","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2309204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raphael Bendahan","original_name":"Raphael Bendahan","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/qp7mOtjW6ICg2XnCwpVX5HwIGzJ.jpg","credit_id":"5cd5734ec3a36869cafdbada","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0194309","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cB07MlCtu6m2ezfhhSTguFwkVNH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
