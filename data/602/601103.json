The last images of a film which lets you no escape, no more escape than the punkette who exhibits her genitals in a toilet hallway, no more escape than all these rockstars who belch to fill the void. On the music aspect, there is a combinatorial saturation of sounds that looks like a requiem. The images : uninterrupted movement un a daily apocalyptic space. This is about savagery, frantic intoxication, suicidal energy.","popularity":0.1196,"poster_path":"/ePwyIehjYCOYb2dzZu1oHMJKEiK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1982-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Entrée de secours","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2307904,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicole Deschaumes","original_name":"Nicole Deschaumes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd306a09251415ff0253cba","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2307906,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bernard Lamarka","original_name":"Bernard Lamarka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd306c20e0a2678aafebdb1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2307904,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicole Deschaumes","original_name":"Nicole Deschaumes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd3069ac3a3683b2edb0128","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2307904,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicole Deschaumes","original_name":"Nicole Deschaumes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd306a70e0a262fb30c642e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2307905,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruno de Freminville","original_name":"Bruno de Freminville","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd306b6925141045631a20f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jérôme de Missolz","original_name":"Jérôme de Missolz","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff6446fce5d82003dbcac30","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jérôme de Missolz","original_name":"Jérôme de Missolz","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff64481886348003f8604ac","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jérôme de Missolz","original_name":"Jérôme de Missolz","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff64492d6c300003f578766","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038647,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jérôme de Missolz","original_name":"Jérôme de Missolz","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ff6446146e75f0040b99cf2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ePwyIehjYCOYb2dzZu1oHMJKEiK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Ateliers 81/82, ARC-MAMVP","release_date":"1982-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jérôme De Missolz, Entrée de Secours (Excerpt)","key":"93615974","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2014-05-02T13:58:52.000Z","id":"5cd4a164c3a36869d8fc72db"}]}}}
