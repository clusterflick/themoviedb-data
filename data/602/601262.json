Like a storyteller, he shares with us a story: the tale of a scientist who discovers a contaminated river and tries to understand the sources of this problem. Accompanied by an artist and a young guide, he pursues his research in remotes territories covered by a large forest. As the old narrator continues his tale, he engages himself in a long journey between river and vegetation, a quest that connects him to his own story.","popularity":0.0838,"poster_path":"/5rJZnQTO9fqTpQ4rIofpcR2pJSo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76612,"logo_path":"/kE6mXnRHkS3bHpu1hikx1U1pFyo.png","name":"Spectre Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Green Vessel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2308319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Etienne de France","original_name":"Etienne de France","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd3c40b92514103093af1f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2308319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Etienne de France","original_name":"Etienne de France","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd3c44f925141031b3af21c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2066983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christopher Ulutupu","original_name":"Christopher Ulutupu","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/lBM9isZl8oR9hHRK4wAWQw6RYB5.jpg","credit_id":"5cd3c4810e0a265df1607585","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2308319,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Etienne de France","original_name":"Etienne de France","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd3c48f0e0a265e096075d4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1764659,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Olivier Marbœuf","original_name":"Olivier Marbœuf","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd3c49f0e0a265df16075a1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":932230,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cédric Walter","original_name":"Cédric Walter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd3c4d2c3a36869d5fb3eb5","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5rJZnQTO9fqTpQ4rIofpcR2pJSo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
