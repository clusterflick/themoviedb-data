Through the performance, Anger probes and dissects her “abandoned” works to re-imagine the relationship between the audience, the filmmaker, the movie theater and cinema and erases the line between a filmmaker’s corporeal body and their body of work. A vital, singular, innovative work that explores what it means to be a woman and an artist, the project showcases Anger’s sensibilities and pushes the boundaries of cinematic experience.","popularity":0.1286,"poster_path":"/iFsYAMkKHDqmJX0RYkLOCdhPEdy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34777,"logo_path":"/slfGgHfiKJsHjoeAhfLykCflt6h.png","name":"MEMORY","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Live Cinema Presentation","title":"My First Film","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1510680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zia Anger","original_name":"Zia Anger","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":"/gDlPzTyv6s9ehNiRFJpRLCGhzGw.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e861ac4691cd500145991ee","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1510680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zia Anger","original_name":"Zia Anger","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":"/gDlPzTyv6s9ehNiRFJpRLCGhzGw.jpg","credit_id":"5cd6fb370e0a262defcc43d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1510680,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zia Anger","original_name":"Zia Anger","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":"/gDlPzTyv6s9ehNiRFJpRLCGhzGw.jpg","credit_id":"5ebeae036d675a00217c56d4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hSNMy9GwYSSPZyj1xOXQwRpcYUZ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1919}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iFsYAMkKHDqmJX0RYkLOCdhPEdy.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":3,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
