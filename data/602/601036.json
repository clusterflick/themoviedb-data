Several people call him \"Ted Crockett\",who supposedly has been dead for five years, and a bartender advises him to say he is Crockett, as he can aid the law abiding citizens that way. Both Red Grindy, leader of the town's badmen, and Sheriff Ben Adams are fooled by Larry's resemblence to Crockett, as is Crockett's young widow, Mary, until Larry convinces her his isn't. He finds that all of the Crockett cowhands, with the exception of Neal King, are systematically rustling Mary's cattle. Larry takes charge, sends to Texas for his riders and then brings to an end the reign of terror Grindy and his men have over the territory. Creased in the head by a gunshot, Larry is freed of his amnesia and turns out to actually be Ted Crockett.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/5D5KXtjA7HsCQJy9jL8lJ27NP84.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Man Justice","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0029348","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5D5KXtjA7HsCQJy9jL8lJ27NP84.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1937-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
