Baltzer, a Jewish-American Columbia graduate and Fulbright scholar, presents her discoveries as a volunteer with the International Women's Peace Service in the West Bank, documenting human rights abuses and supporting Palestinian-led nonviolent resistance to the Occupation. Baltzer's presentation provides those interested in the issue with critical information and documentation that can be difficult to obtain through mainstream media sources, and to encourage informed action. Topics include checkpoints, settlements, Israeli activism, Zionism, 1948 War & refugees, censorship, the Wall, and environmental devastation. The granddaughter of Holocaust refugees, Baltzer works to address the injustices of today in light of those of the past. She is author of the book Witness in Palestine.","popularity":0.1303,"poster_path":"/kuUkuZ1M39ICwYMZ4RfPUKAvuku.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2008-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life in Occupied Palestine","title":"Life in Occupied Palestine: Eyewitness Stories & Photos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2309875,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Baltzer","original_name":"Anna Baltzer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd67249c3a36875bcc0860e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2309875,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Baltzer","original_name":"Anna Baltzer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd672310e0a262df2cb6a67","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.681,"height":890,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kuUkuZ1M39ICwYMZ4RfPUKAvuku.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":606}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5907,"name":"palestinian-israeli conflict"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Anna Baltzer: Life in occupied Palestine: Eyewitness stories & Photos - Trailer 2010","key":"T5T7ru2dxQI","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2010-03-26T02:42:10.000Z","id":"5cd674acc3a36817d2c0c02d"}]}}}
