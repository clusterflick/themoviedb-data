A self-made millionaire, Pellatt was derided by fellow aristocrats for nouveau-riche pretentions:  the house and its décor considered by many an ornate fake.  Its original contents were sold at Pellatt’s bankruptcy auction in 1924. Today the building is a museum. The movie has three sections—the first in a cellar tunnel, the next in a first-story workroom near the stables, the third in the tower’s summit.","popularity":0.0789,"poster_path":"/bVpe2qcN06wTUKobnwCrJx9JBKq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118276,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corpus Fluxus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Casa Loma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498102,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross Lipman","original_name":"Ross Lipman","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd7bb43c3a3682daec067df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1427791,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Patrick Gleeson","original_name":"Patrick Gleeson","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd7bb589251412486cdc792","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bVpe2qcN06wTUKobnwCrJx9JBKq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15216,"name":"avant-garde"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Date unknown","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
