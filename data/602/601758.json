While most of these were utilitarian in nature, Bouanani, Tazi, and Rechiche took a different route with this film, creating a modernist “city symphony” film that documented six hours in the life of the city of Casablanca. Combining a hard bebop soundtrack with stunning black and white cinematography and a radical editing style, the film stands as a document to the energetic experimentation of this period of Moroccan art and cinema.","popularity":0.2662,"poster_path":"/csC510QlhYuXXaMSt1v3tgxmvqd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36252,"logo_path":"/xHIIkI4AXFHrz8jiUzcQtd6dt6W.png","name":"Centre Cinématographique Marocain","origin_country":"MA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"1968-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Six and Twelve","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Six et douze","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Six & Twelve","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"6 et 12","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1330688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahmed Bouanani","original_name":"Ahmed Bouanani","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/iCWh0qwVdCP95p92dYitH55EOhP.jpg","credit_id":"5cd71b9c0e0a263080cc3924","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1330688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahmed Bouanani","original_name":"Ahmed Bouanani","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/iCWh0qwVdCP95p92dYitH55EOhP.jpg","credit_id":"5cd71b75c3a36817d2c1cef1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1432975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed Abderrahman Tazi","original_name":"Mohamed Abderrahman Tazi","popularity":0.1026,"profile_path":"/lKiCBcUZG0vvhNnn0D3Dezgcgjy.jpg","credit_id":"5cd71b90c3a36817c9c1c50b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2274386,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Abdelmajid Rechiche","original_name":"Abdelmajid Rechiche","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f45130f1d01910033da4dee","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1432975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed Abderrahman Tazi","original_name":"Mohamed Abderrahman Tazi","popularity":0.1026,"profile_path":"/lKiCBcUZG0vvhNnn0D3Dezgcgjy.jpg","credit_id":"5f4512bd1d01910036d9f52b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1330688,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ahmed Bouanani","original_name":"Ahmed Bouanani","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/iCWh0qwVdCP95p92dYitH55EOhP.jpg","credit_id":"5f45129b965220003450cbb9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2274386,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Abdelmajid Rechiche","original_name":"Abdelmajid Rechiche","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4512f24142910035521e4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1432975,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mohamed Abderrahman Tazi","original_name":"Mohamed Abderrahman Tazi","popularity":0.1026,"profile_path":"/lKiCBcUZG0vvhNnn0D3Dezgcgjy.jpg","credit_id":"5f45131f68929c0033b224c4","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2274386,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Abdelmajid Rechiche","original_name":"Abdelmajid Rechiche","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4512d50d11f20031b3b00f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/csC510QlhYuXXaMSt1v3tgxmvqd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1623,"name":"casablanca, morocco"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlinale Forum","release_date":"2017-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"MA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1968-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
