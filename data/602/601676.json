She rebels against them but also tries to understand the generation gap between them. While she gets angry and questions their expectations of her as a woman (i.e., to marry and have children), she also gropes for the meaning of real love. Along with her mother and grandmother, the three women wring out their loves and hates with explosive strength. The director in her performance piece uses her own body to project the images of her mother, turning her lost loves into springboards, practically jumping out of the screen so she can shout with all her might.","popularity":0.0678,"poster_path":"/uD44CIPb7huAxE5IVkasLep1Bux.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caochangdi Workstation","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2010-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self-Portrait with Three Women","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1969314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhang Mengqi","original_name":"Zhang Mengqi","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/qhQLLpQmLFFEMXbiMCdmakZe0id.jpg","credit_id":"5ce588280e0a262573cd3895","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1969314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhang Mengqi","original_name":"Zhang Mengqi","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/qhQLLpQmLFFEMXbiMCdmakZe0id.jpg","credit_id":"5cd6c6f7c3a36817bdc14f13","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1969314,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhang Mengqi","original_name":"Zhang Mengqi","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/qhQLLpQmLFFEMXbiMCdmakZe0id.jpg","credit_id":"5cd6c70b92514106eece8b0c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5148752","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/uD44CIPb7huAxE5IVkasLep1Bux.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/83TftzaYhpJs1ZfZ0RlPyqpwGHM.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1175},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r00T0gcIBaHa1PMLgIlfhw5Th5G.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
