The artist lived there, outside the small town of Narsaq, Greenland, with her parents and siblings in the late 1960s. In the film, Arke strokes the artificial landscape, rolls across it, and sniffs it like an animal. Then she methodically rips the entire thing to shreds, gathers the curled shards of paper, and lets them fall across her shoulders and thighs.\" - Vanessa Gregory","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/9VK6VjJcjbsicc6Ab5YKzKdyBrN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arctic Hysteria","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2309475,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pia Arke","original_name":"Pia Arke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd59f3dc3a36869d5fdd1a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9VK6VjJcjbsicc6Ab5YKzKdyBrN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
