He travels in a shared car with three other passengers. Conflict arises when the car breaks down and the driver is unable to fix it, causing some of the passengers to grow frustrated and angry. Amid the tension and uncertainty, they begin to open up to each other—sharing their backgrounds and the personal struggles they face. Through this unexpected moment of connection, they come to a new realization: “mangkat” (to depart) is not just about a physical journey, but about the courage to face life itself. Eventually, they manage to repair the car and continue their journey.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vlYLMU04sKF4Sbh0LuKjxHbScPc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":269829,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terus Terang Mas","origin_country":""},{"id":269830,"logo_path":null,"name":"All Of Us","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"The journey breaks down, but the soul moves forward","title":"Mangkat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5308318,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Devlita Hartarti","original_name":"Devlita Hartarti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Siti","credit_id":"688cc1c6649f3f1839b7e669","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5599843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanto sudrajat","original_name":"Tanto sudrajat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Pak Andi","credit_id":"688cc1d43d2e6e8393de5f45","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5599844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabian rafi","original_name":"Fabian rafi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Rian","credit_id":"688cc1dfb3419ca7da7ceb26","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4852143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malik Fajar","original_name":"Malik Fajar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sopir","credit_id":"688cc1ed0fca0edcaf7cea22","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5308360,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Firhand Ardhana","original_name":"Firhand Ardhana","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Angga","credit_id":"688d280949b3405dbd61e839","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5599815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zainal Ferdiansyah","original_name":"Zainal Ferdiansyah","popularity":0.0857,"profile_path":"/yxrSZ6Gpg9d5QlgwAPSqgWz72wp.jpg","credit_id":"688cbea0bb22289fdf61e575","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5599816,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lazuardi ramadhan","original_name":"Lazuardi ramadhan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688cbeb7770f40efb326108e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5599817,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Atha Sahil","original_name":"Atha Sahil","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688cbed669a19e7081b22254","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5599815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zainal Ferdiansyah","original_name":"Zainal Ferdiansyah","popularity":0.0857,"profile_path":"/yxrSZ6Gpg9d5QlgwAPSqgWz72wp.jpg","credit_id":"688cc2649cf7ff713bb7e643","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mAO4oKff1QYozmXTfO9dia9ekhN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vlYLMU04sKF4Sbh0LuKjxHbScPc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1366}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9935,"name":"travel"},{"id":15291,"name":"on the road"},{"id":266032,"name":"strangers"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"SU","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"id","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MANGKAT FILM","key":"1106472356","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2025-08-01T13:51:33.000Z","id":"688cc7ee763439387bf3d8c0"}]}}}
