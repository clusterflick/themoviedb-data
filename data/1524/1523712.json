Before the event began, players selected which island they wanted to join without knowing the traits of each island. Each day, all players logged on at the same time, and session lasted around 2-3 hours. For the most part, players could do whatever they want. We did set a few limitations on the players to promote a better experience, like banning random killing (RDM), disabling most Minecraft enchantments, disabling unrealistic items like ender pearls, disabling other dimensions like the Nether, and a few more misc. rules.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":154,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One island has everything, the other has nothing.
