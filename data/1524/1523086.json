We see midtown Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, the subways... as they were and as they are. The film brings us back to the housing abandonment and subway graffiti of the 1980s and brings us forward to the pandemic of 2020 and 2021. We see a pre-pandemic Manhattan that is thriving and prosperous for some. We witness an ever-changing City -- but we also see parallels.  This is not a conventional documentary. There are no talking-head interviews and there is no voice-over narration. But neither is this an unstructured assortment of kaleidoscopic images. Rather, the film aims to guide the viewer through the far-flung precincts of New York in space and time. The subject is New York â€“ past present and future.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New York Then and Now","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1994025,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Siegel","original_name":"Steven Siegel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/vAhN8UF6J5OfLsuyCEPGbBB8Iz6.jpg","credit_id":"688b7f48a0a1022a2a948ad7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"New York Then and Now (2021)","key":"Psy8gNmt4pI","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2022-11-26T16:45:32.000Z","id":"688b7f7ef728526eb52a5eb9"}]}}}
