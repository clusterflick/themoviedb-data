Filmmaker Kamila Kuc steps into the emotional stream of inherited family history as the lines between documentary, testimony, and fiction blur. She performs acts of bearing witness not just for herself but also on behalf of her grandmother. Together, they testify to their experiences and the reverberations these stories have over time. I Was There is a palimpsest - a layered tapestry where past and present intertwine in the intimate process of activating memory and vulnerability as forms of resistance. It honors the testimonial object inherited from ancestors and the living connection that binds generations in the shared pursuit of justice and healing.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"I Was There","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1404498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kamila Kuc","original_name":"Kamila Kuc","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688b6e14a54fbfda299489d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mimesis","release_date":"2025-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
