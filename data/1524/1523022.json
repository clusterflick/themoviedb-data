Exhale in a sharp burst through the nostrils to send. Quartz is the medium—amplifier, transducer, archive. Inspired by the research of Marcel Vogel—IBM senior research chemist turned spiritual scientist—A Telephone for God oscillates between past and present, tuning into frequencies of human–plant communication and energetic healing. The film follows Drew Tousley, one of the few crystal cutters personally trained by Vogel before his passing in 1991, as he creates a four-sided Vogel crystal modeled after the Kabbalistic Tree of Life. Alongside him, energy healer and Reiki Master Carly Tousley reflects on the use of crystals in healing. Award-winning artist Merik Goma stars as Vogel’s present-day assistant.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"A Telephone for God","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2621189,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicky Tavares","original_name":"Nicky Tavares","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688b6f6ad9f4d6b3a42a5f4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mimesis","release_date":"2025-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
