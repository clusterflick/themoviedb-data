Combining a literary background with an interest in philosophy, music, and experimental cinema, his research focuses on the relationship between modernity, space, and speed. His films have been presented in Quebec and Canada.  The epicenter of the Industrial Revolution, the Lachine Canal has long been a symbol of the acceleration of capital circulation. As part of the 200th anniversary of the canal's inauguration, this feature film pays tribute to the life, death, and rebirth of one of the most remarkable remnants of industrial capitalism.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"For It Shall Rule","title":"Il faut qu'il règne","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36595109","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
