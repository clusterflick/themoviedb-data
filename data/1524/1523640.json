This apartment, rendered through a 3D scan of original photographs, becomes a digital reconquest of territory as Marko visits it through VR for the first time since 2018. He cannot return to Ukraine or Donbas (now Russia) due to the ongoing war caused by Russia's aggressive full-scale invasion. To inherit the apartment Marko needs to enter the country of Russia, where he immediately will be conscripted and forced to go to war to fight against his own country Ukraine.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/cTzwXzL9AZXWgc2ZaZ2Jr1IvtLo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fortisfemfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":11687,"logo_path":"/gW6YiDdhkySff27C0m4JXu30879.png","name":"Le Fresnoy","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RAPTURE I - VISIT","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5600244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marko Kolomytskyi","original_name":"Marko Kolomytskyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Marko Kolomytskyi","credit_id":"688cff31924d3aa1b5b7e7d8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2064774,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Alan Guichaoua","original_name":"Alan Guichaoua","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688cff85d565f8eacc2610c8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1973977,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alisa Berger","original_name":"Alisa Berger","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688cff9793c38690d9de6051","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5438531,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lila Lemoine","original_name":"Lila Lemoine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688cffa6c5557cae3911d05d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2279845,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gerald Schauder","original_name":"Gerald Schauder","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688cffc2518ee41a71a45d94","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1973977,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alisa Berger","original_name":"Alisa Berger","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688cffd3649f3f1839b7e7dc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2359308,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yannick Delmaire","original_name":"Yannick Delmaire","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688cffe3763439387bf3d9e4","department":"Crew","job":"Mixing Engineer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37741302","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cTzwXzL9AZXWgc2ZaZ2Jr1IvtLo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
