Thwarted by powerful landowners, mediocre politicians, and an insensitive bureaucracy, these unlikely allies fight for a utopia of nature and community, in a battle that reflects the plight of the contemporary West. Is theirs a hopeless struggle, or can they still rewrite their own destiny?","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tevere Corsaro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1972355,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pietro Balla","original_name":"Pietro Balla","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688b87ee05fa2b58f1335818","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1972356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monica Repetto","original_name":"Monica Repetto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688b87f9c4c6e1bb63948b3c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
