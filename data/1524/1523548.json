The game is Sauce, and its demands are heavy. The master questions the young novice, testing him to see if he is worthy, and all the while deftly shuffles his cups of the finest and tastiest sauces, making patterns and shapes that confound the younger man. Finally, it is all too much, and the neophyte must try his skill against the master in this great game—but is it a game? The young man will have to learn quickly if he doesn’t want to get lost in the game of Sauce.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sauce","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5599901,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Goblin","original_name":"Richard Goblin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688cc9ae35be685e38b7e7b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
