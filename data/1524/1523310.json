When they move to a gray village to open a shop, the vibrant creations are replaced by dull clothing. Years later, Henry longs for the inspiration of his youth. A visit from a troupe of street performers rekindles his dream: to transform the village into a place full of color and expression, where everyone can be themselves. After many setbacks, he faces a choice between personal happiness or continued commitment to change.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tJTprNoDS6gX7A55ECalVAYLKaA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De Gouden Draad","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5598852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rodríquez Romeros","original_name":"Rodríquez Romeros","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"688c00e33159fee6dfde5d1e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4200600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donnavon Madaran","original_name":"Donnavon Madaran","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"688c00f8adf70d1a47de5cc8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4670366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nanne Statema","original_name":"Nanne Statema","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"688c01013159fee6dfde5d23","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3814894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Wenting","original_name":"Elizabeth Wenting","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"688c01128bf25afc2f7ce842","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5202374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bram Legerstee","original_name":"Bram Legerstee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"688c011b825dd7dd12a45874","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3814910,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Juliet Ketner","original_name":"Juliet Ketner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ut4l8JZ9PAU8n5vQOTGPbrtH6CB.jpg","credit_id":"688c00741095ff5b87b21ee9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3814910,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Juliet Ketner","original_name":"Juliet Ketner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/ut4l8JZ9PAU8n5vQOTGPbrtH6CB.jpg","credit_id":"688c008093b408c4d4b21f99","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3821248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyra Antoni","original_name":"Kyra Antoni","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688c00906ddcdf6a2d260da3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3726922,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Abby Buddingh","original_name":"Abby Buddingh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688c009a14709ec0a3b21f72","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37647836","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/tJTprNoDS6gX7A55ECalVAYLKaA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
