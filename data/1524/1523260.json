Serving as a sequel to the creator's first machinima, \"SOMETHING STRANGE IN STRANGETOWN\" (2007), the film continues the story of an unnamed protagonist who was abducted by a mysterious light. Now named Lavinia, she is dropped into the technologically advanced desert town of StrangerVille with no memory of what transpired. The film follows Lavinia as she teams up with George Cahill and Erwin Pries to investigate the source of a mysterious, disembodied voice only she can hear. Their search for answers leads them to a classified government lab at the heart of the town’s strange occurrences, where they must confront the truth behind the town’s bizarre infection and Lavinia’s own past.","popularity":0.1714,"poster_path":"/1XSVBbtfN8XsgfGZE6SORv2HZgD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":246757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soprano
