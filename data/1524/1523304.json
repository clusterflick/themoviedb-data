Between power blackouts, mass migration, and extreme heat, they spend their days together on the street, longing for a wave of coolness. A mysterious call leads them to an empty house in the north. There, the swimmers enjoy its comforts and a large pool, but ruin it by overindulging. Overwhelmed by the delirium of the heat and the ecstasy of the water, they invade other empty houses in the neighborhood, trying out every pool they find. However, the heat remains a hellish threat.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":207472,"logo_path":null,"name":"Los Nadadores Cine","origin_country":""},{"id":154890,"logo_path":null,"name":"Benuca Films","origin_country":""},{"id":269760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmulation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"The Swimmers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Swimmers","type":"International English Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5372934,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Valentina D'Emilio","original_name":"Valentina D'Emilio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"688bfa97282b8cb50db21fb7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3962817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sol Iglesias SK","original_name":"Sol Iglesias SK","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"688bfaa46326113642de5d27","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5372934,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Valentina D'Emilio","original_name":"Valentina D'Emilio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688bfab4916fb18cde61e278","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3962817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sol Iglesias SK","original_name":"Sol Iglesias SK","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688bfac3899f40efdf7ce82a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3962817,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sol Iglesias SK","original_name":"Sol Iglesias SK","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688bfacd65d7348aeeb21f55","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5598800,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin Szereszevsky","original_name":"Martin Szereszevsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688bfaf2a770116addb22031","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3104488,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Fernando Montes de Oca","original_name":"Fernando Montes de Oca","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/jyBK0IAMb8mcFcL8yskjba8pbVE.jpg","credit_id":"688bfb0065d7348aeeb21f58","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5598804,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alfonso Reina-Cecco","original_name":"Alfonso Reina-Cecco","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688bfb122e409f1f3e61e297","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37738526","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
