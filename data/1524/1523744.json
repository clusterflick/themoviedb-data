Gifted with a sensitivity to light and shadow, Da Jiang discovers an old box containing shadow puppets and a script of The Tale of Hibiscus, which ignites his artistic passion. When Changhong loses his voice before a major farewell performance, Da Jiang steps in, winning Tianyin's gratitude. But rumors spread after she is seen attending his shadow puppet show, and Da Jiang leaves in silence to avoid conflict. Tianyin and Changhong go to Shanghai, while Da Jiang retreats to Yanguan Town, living aboard an abandoned boat and vowing to revive the once-glorious art of Haining shadow puppetry. There, he founds his own troupe: “Jianghai Ban.”","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3p1s90iFK5AjzFI2iF46d2Djthd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadow Puppet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3814639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Huang Xiaolei","original_name":"Huang Xiaolei","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/gkuyBPfqQoC5QZETdtEP9SNwqOa.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"688d2e43c5557cae3911d129","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5520978,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ren Zhong","original_name":"Ren Zhong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"688d2e52ab9e5621477ced5f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3255682,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wu Qijiang","original_name":"Qijiang Wu","popularity":0.0531,"profile_path":"/sFAsRJctLuthO6ZNC6iUwGwUALC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"688d2e5cab9e5621477ced62","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3230118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Qining Li","original_name":"Qining Li","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"688d2e3224f18fded3b223d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.678,"height":885,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/3p1s90iFK5AjzFI2iF46d2Djthd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2007-08-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
