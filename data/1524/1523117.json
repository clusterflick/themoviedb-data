One of the most successful figurative painters working today, she came to prominence as part of the YBA movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s. She has been reluctant to discuss her work for many years on television, until now. Alan Yentob was working with her on a film for Imagine and caught up with her in Vienna on the eve of two major 2025 exhibitions she is mounting. This was the last interview Alan Yentob conducted in a career spanning six decades at the BBC, bringing many of the worldâ€™s leading artists and creatives to the screen. Alan also persuaded Jenny to allow cameras into her painting studio for the first time in almost three decades.","popularity":0.1143,"poster_path":"/z6zUzDfoDnypWCqLKJZHdM8rF6n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":216100,"logo_path":"/j81yKMaTovhKX25qbrwtnIyisuG.png","name":"BBC Studios Specialist
