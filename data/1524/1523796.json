The two grew up together and became very fond of each other; over time, their friendship blossomed into love. Then the father sent the boy to study in the capital. Gigi suffered greatly from his absence and spent her time waiting for his return. Finally, the big day arrived: she learned that the boy was returning. He did return, but he was accompanied by someone else: to marry a girl from the capital. As soon as he arrived, the boy sent for Gigi to introduce her to his wife. This is where the story reached its climax; Gigi resisted the news of the wedding, but could not withstand the final blow. The pain was so great that Gigi poisoned herself and died.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wcUuvLHzKU4cGKgzgyhE1MdUUBd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":269869,"logo_path":null,"name":"ABAM - Associação Brasileira de Arte Muda","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gigi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5600872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gervásio Guimarães","original_name":"Gervásio Guimarães","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Seu Dudu","credit_id":"688d4087649f3f1839b7e8dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5600873,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosa de Maio","original_name":"Rosa de Maio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Gigi","credit_id":"688d409bd713a653d511d2a7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5600875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Haillot","original_name":"Carlos Haillot","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"João Cotó","credit_id":"688d40b0eaa4f306e07ceeba","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5600876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antônio Valles","original_name":"Antônio Valles","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Administrador","credit_id":"688d40c9cd114ef50061e7de","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1443650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rosa Sandrini","original_name":"Rosa Sandrini","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/h2hKUhV1HmfxM54tzhmc6h6xaU0.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mme.
