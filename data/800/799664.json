Momo is a bento (box lunch) delivery girl who sends bento lunches to Shino and Junko, who are colleagues in an office. Momo would always tell her dreams to Shino or Junko. One day Shino gets a call from an ex-boyfriend whom she has not met for 30 years. Junko has doubts about her relationship with her boyfriend. Their 3 lives cross and diverge in oblique and tangential ways. As the story weaves around issues of love, relationships, insecurity, death and the blurring between dreams and reality, the men in their lives are always present but hardly seen or heard.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dKEvrqoskgkd17gRYu5lLqg8cc7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2009-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hashi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sherman Ong","original_name":"Sherman Ong","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60344df94c1d9a0041de6c24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1538823","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dKEvrqoskgkd17gRYu5lLqg8cc7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ph6Wy9vFi2XtNSNNHy2KBxBGmN7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":849}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Barcelona Asian Film Festival","release_date":"2009-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2009-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
