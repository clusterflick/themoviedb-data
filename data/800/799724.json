Memory of Objects illustrates these haphazard intersections of space and time by capturing film projections on dilapidated rural edifices. Shot on a beautiful 16mm, we see chaotic movements of light drape over barnyards and bathtubsâ€”evoking memories of violence that haunt rural decay. Memory of Objects disrupts our linear perceptions of time by demonstrating how past traumas bleed into the present moment and latch themselves onto physical space.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/abL8Rd9RpHj71aH16M5uXPx7YYa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memory of Objects","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2987660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Maxson","original_name":"David Maxson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"6034a9fec6006d003bbaa3e8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2987661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Miles","original_name":"Christopher Miles","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6034aa05813831004187a977","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Russell Sheaffer","original_name":"Russell Sheaffer","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/sV7SnZCiSDsZ6nRCCH1fbusdtaD.jpg","credit_id":"6034a9bc0d294400415a22b3","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Russell Sheaffer","original_name":"Russell Sheaffer","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/sV7SnZCiSDsZ6nRCCH1fbusdtaD.jpg","credit_id":"6034a9b6e78687003ed21f5a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2987671,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Connor Ebbinghouse","original_name":"Connor Ebbinghouse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6034a9efc2b9df003e4a14b3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Russell Sheaffer","original_name":"Russell Sheaffer","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/sV7SnZCiSDsZ6nRCCH1fbusdtaD.jpg","credit_id":"6034a9c7c6006d003cbaacb7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2987669,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Richard Zanon","original_name":"Richard Zanon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6034a9e1e786870040d1f03f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2987671,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Connor Ebbinghouse","original_name":"Connor Ebbinghouse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6034a9f797eab4003ed1d6c4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Russell Sheaffer","original_name":"Russell Sheaffer","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/sV7SnZCiSDsZ6nRCCH1fbusdtaD.jpg","credit_id":"6034a9cc4c1d9a0041df071d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2987669,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Richard Zanon","original_name":"Richard Zanon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6034a9db746457003f0129f6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Russell Sheaffer","original_name":"Russell Sheaffer","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/sV7SnZCiSDsZ6nRCCH1fbusdtaD.jpg","credit_id":"6034a9c24c1d9a003fdeeedf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Russell Sheaffer","original_name":"Russell Sheaffer","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":"/sV7SnZCiSDsZ6nRCCH1fbusdtaD.jpg","credit_id":"6034a9ac700bf70040a36180","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2987669,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Richard Zanon","original_name":"Richard Zanon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6034a9d6700bf7003ea35202","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3006778","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/abL8Rd9RpHj71aH16M5uXPx7YYa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
