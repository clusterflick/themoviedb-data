I’m not a fan of modern dance, but I think this is why my fascination that evening was sincere and convinced. Above all, I was struck by the way the choreographer was able to take the explicit gestures and movements of sexual communication and transform them into the language of dance. And since body language is one of the topics I have been interested in filming since that ‘scandalous’ Guardami, I was already sufficiently motivated to transform the ballet into a movie.\" - Davide Ferrario","popularity":1.733,"poster_path":"/5GA4gokhUDID0p9VbcwUTi7SIYW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30824,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rossofuoco","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2015-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sexxx","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3136345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Furnes Bjerkestrand","original_name":"Furnes Bjerkestrand","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60d610c4ef9d72002fadcf16","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3136346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Bruno","original_name":"Denis Bruno","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60d610cc25b9550073a45d83","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3136347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco De Alteriis","original_name":"Marco De Alteriis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"60d610d688055100457cf40f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3136348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuela Maugeri","original_name":"Manuela Maugeri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"60d610de109cd00081d58779","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3136349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vito Pansini","original_name":"Vito Pansini","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"60d610e67aecc60045d040aa","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3136350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viola Scaglione","original_name":"Viola Scaglione","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"60d610f233ad8f007f802ded","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2998220,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ladis Zanini","original_name":"Ladis Zanini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62327d6e53866e001eac9f2b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Davide Ferrario","original_name":"Davide Ferrario","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/bd3WUGms10Rim9eBTAWRIsxTHL.jpg","credit_id":"62327d7a01e4d1007503c671","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1194540,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Francesca Bocca","original_name":"Francesca Bocca","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62327d84109cd0001bbdec2d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1497195,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Vito Martinelli","original_name":"Vito Martinelli","popularity":0.0666,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62327da3c525c4001c7d5ac6","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985588,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fabrizio Vacca","original_name":"Fabrizio Vacca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62327dacdd83fa004573b395","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3136352,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matteo Levaggi","original_name":"Matteo Levaggi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62327ddda14e10001b01dd5f","department":"Writing","job":"Theatre Play"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Davide Ferrario","original_name":"Davide Ferrario","popularity":0.065,"profile_path":"/bd3WUGms10Rim9eBTAWRIsxTHL.jpg","credit_id":"6032418a1fb94f003f8dffcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1355980,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cristina Sardo","original_name":"Cristina Sardo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"603241d3c26796003ccbcede","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5909066","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1134,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5GA4gokhUDID0p9VbcwUTi7SIYW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":794}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
