This video work combines several stories, including how the artists’ familial histories relate to colonial history, an examination of how their relationship is formed through the virtual space, and thoughts on the implications of the post-human condition. The Finding Fanon series is inspired by the lost plays of Frantz Fanon, (1925-1961) a politically radical humanist whose practice dealt with the psychopathology of colonisation and the social and cultural consequences of decolonisation. Throughout the series, Achiampong and Blandy negotiate Fanon’s ideas, examining the politics of race, racism and decolonisation, and how these societal issues affect our relationship amidst an age of new technology, popular culture and globalisation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2zmXFkW4Drp6kwHh8sAYvP9v9ti.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artsadmin","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Finding Fanon 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"파농을 찾아서 2","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2985755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hayleigh-Joy Rose","original_name":"Hayleigh-Joy Rose","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Voiceover","credit_id":"6032808d11386c003e943d15","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1826254,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Larry Achiampong","original_name":"Larry Achiampong","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60327fa096e30b004224104e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1934715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Blandy","original_name":"David Blandy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60327fb37f6c8d003c11a83b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10492974","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1875,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2zmXFkW4Drp6kwHh8sAYvP9v9ti.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1250}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
