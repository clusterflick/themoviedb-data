Rather than uniting opposites, rhythm is set up by the struggling eye, varying as the image is moved closer to and further from the screen's center. The sound, with its fragmentations and its implications of incompleteness, focuses attention on the impossibility of a resolution in the film's dichotomy. \"Rather than crediting the camera with objectivity according to the usual convention in film, the viewer is confronted with the relativity of simultaneous multiple perspectives. The soundtrack underlines the arbitrary relationship between a sign and its signifier, as does Magritte's painting, Ceci n'est pas une pipe.\" â€“ The Art Examiner","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/bvPwl4Jsb2EP9GEN9nPOdVtAssb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145057,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bette Gordon","original_name":"Bette Gordon","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":"/2zMKcPF9RRtFnP9zkiBAK6PCN5O.jpg","credit_id":"60348effc2b9df003d49b414","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bvPwl4Jsb2EP9GEN9nPOdVtAssb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
