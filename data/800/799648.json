His new $74,000 Cadillac, which he dubs “White Lightning” is the pride of his considerable possessions. Matthew is also proud of his very upscale church in Tennessee.  When God sends him a dream in the night, he has to reconsider his priorities in life. The nocturnal vision leads him to a local faith based drug/alcohol rehab center operated by Mission Teens. While Matthew is trying to determine a road map for his life, two substance abusers in the Heartland are trying to avoid being sent to an obscure community in Tennessee for rehabilitation. Circumstances put both Shane and Susan on the same bus, headed to Davy Crockett country and a rendezvous with a proud young pastor, Cupid, and the Holy Spirit","popularity":0.2104,"poster_path":"/xPOYQx3LWZ4RgvIoFQSn6PVykIP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76815,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sword of the Spirit Publishing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Jesus: The Ultimate High","title":"Mission Improbable","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":169396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron Arnett","original_name":"Cameron Arnett","popularity":0.2934,"profile_path":"/r9JFN7CyYzybehriG8vB0F7280n.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Dereck","credit_id":"60342a70e786870040d144f6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1619928,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Donald James Parker","original_name":"Donald James Parker","popularity":0.1726,"profile_path":"/mRSOWQ59AroZyl8mMue1sT4yrL1.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Jack Gordon","credit_id":"60342a83c2b9df0040491ca2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1621251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Collin Alexander Brown","original_name":"Collin Alexander Brown","popularity":0.0798,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Shane","credit_id":"60342a924c1d9a0042de42eb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2987213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kimberly J.
