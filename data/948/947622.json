Her friend Miki is worried about the outspoken but inactive girl, but her expectations are defied and her romance takes a sudden turn for the better. One day, however, he sees her toasting a Coke with a guy. 'Who is that guy?' Later, he sees Mai chewing gum with a different man in a friendly manner, and when he sees her smoking a cool cigarette with another man. Miki gives the example of herself and her boyfriend Akira and urges him to pursue the truth. Finally, Kakeru takes action...  The elation that love has started. The fear that their relationship might end if she hears this. The film rhythmically conveys these feelings with rapid-fire dialogue and boldly cut images. The character of the protagonist, who is timid, hot-blooded and gentle, honestly embodies the confusion of people in love.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/bLrfwiFFjoqBASPBnXzSRbk8hq4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I
