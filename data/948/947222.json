It was created with an inventive use of digital technology and grew out of an unusual process of interchange between the painter Jean Detheux and the composer Jean Derome. The result is a rare meeting of images and music. Along with Liaisons, the film which precedes it, it constitutes a sort of diptych.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ejLtoqKBsyVOiQfaEYU8BhoNKqM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2005-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rupture","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2068679,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Detheux","original_name":"Jean Detheux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6227bcbea6d9310046220b93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0479145","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ejLtoqKBsyVOiQfaEYU8BhoNKqM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
