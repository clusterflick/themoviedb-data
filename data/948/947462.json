Emilia arrives in the avant-garde capital determined to study at the Royal Academy of Arts and become a painter. She wants to learn the technique to draw what her imagination conceives, a wild dream for a young provincial girl in a world where women can’t even attend an anatomy class. But Emilia wants to live in a world with room for her desires and aspirations. A world she will help to shape thanks to her courage and strength, but also thanks to the network of women she will meet at the Lyceum Club (intellectual salon) and the Residencia de Señoritas (the first women attending university in Spain). Women like Emilia who refuse to limit themselves to the margins of society.","popularity":0.2054,"poster_path":"/nmvstPv40bOCNyTJTYs2SeMcs8l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15284,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Fiesta","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"A World of Their Own","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3458849,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marisa Simon-Moore","original_name":"Marisa Simon-Moore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62295321a579f9006f189d62","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2859699,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carmen Córdoba González","original_name":"Carmen Córdoba González","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xoPzki5rnPfU6XSKdRzKCoxNUXx.jpg","credit_id":"62294ec3d6c300001b1c19ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2953531,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Irene Rodríguez","original_name":"Irene Rodríguez","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62295319d8d32900459add68","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1984633,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Aurora Jimenez Seoane","original_name":"Aurora Jimenez Seoane","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662f6aa8c56d2d0126cd25ca","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1133341,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicolás Matji","original_name":"Nicolás Matji","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"662f6a2760b58d012cdeda48","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nmvstPv40bOCNyTJTYs2SeMcs8l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1050,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/6rCRaBTR8Kfy2Y28Ohlsw2IH9kJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15060,"name":"period drama"},{"id":207876,"name":"1920s"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
