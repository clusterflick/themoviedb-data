Along with the Zapotecs, the Mixtecs are considered the most culturally and artistically advanced group of people of Oaxaca, dating from 2000 BC. The film begins by following a single man from start to finish as he shapes a red clay pot. He extracts the clay from a mountainside, combines it with water and mica (a binding agent), and slowly forms the vessel with his hands. Downs documented this process intimately, using extreme close-ups to meditate on the artist’s hands as he works. As the film progresses, various establishing and mid-range shots are interspersed before transitioning to footage of other men creating their own pottery with their own techniques. Downs’s gentle, personal portrait of the work of the Mixtec potters reveals the process behind an ancient art form.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Making Mixtec Pottery","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2184860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Downs","original_name":"Allen Downs","popularity":0.0458,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622916480c27100045a760a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
