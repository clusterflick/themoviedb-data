One year into his life in the camp, Talib Shah finds himself on the verge of losing hope. Instead of giving up, however, he decides to shoot a film called Picnic − an insider’s look at the lives of thousands of refugees stuck in a place sometimes described as a humanitarian disaster. Exploring topics such as dreams versus reality, art as a means of survival, or the current immigration policies in Europe, the film invites us to become better acquainted with the people who will soon be our neighbours.","popularity":0.1374,"poster_path":"/4zRi9mxRYFBbQdtkOqO9aqr9P1n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171329,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gemini Film &
