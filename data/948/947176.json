Papier mâché puppets ride machines and manipulate robots strange to the human eye. A great masquerade is in the planning, and the air crackles with excitement. Plunged into the joys and frustrations of creating costumes, the zealous puppets produce a bumper crop, each one more elaborate than the last. The film illustrates the creative process, with its inevitable pitfalls and rewards. It says that to create is to be alive.","popularity":0.1029,"poster_path":"/m7gnp6BArPZy0BVtP1CSk8sWpWr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1984-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Masquerade","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Co Hoedeman","original_name":"Co Hoedeman","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/y9G2oaPIpDJ1V016vqdWeHGGQGH.jpg","credit_id":"62279eeb55c1f4007011b3e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0087686","wikidata_id":"Q59278078","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1248,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m7gnp6BArPZy0BVtP1CSk8sWpWr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":832}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
