He hesitates in front of the chest of drawers and his old toy box. Objects turn back the clock, reminding him of childhood, his father's departure, adolescence... His mother also remembers while watching him through a half-open door. Will he succeed in wrenching himself away and crossing the threshold into a new life? An animation film made up of subtle touches that evoke emotion. A sigh, hesitant footsteps, a tinkling of piano notes, a tremor.","popularity":0.0445,"poster_path":"/qbMHFaZOsBRXU8vJVMBHdv86ipl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1998-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Seuil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1335896,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzanne Gervais","original_name":"Suzanne Gervais","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6227ada97a1bd600448d6362","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qbMHFaZOsBRXU8vJVMBHdv86ipl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
