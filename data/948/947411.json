It was adapted for Kabuki the next year by Nagawa Tokusuke I.  The play consisted originally of thirteen acts, one act for each day that passed between Akechi Mitsuhide's murder of Oda Nobunaga and his death at the hand of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The tenth act is the only one which has survived. This act tells of an incident during the battle in which Mitsuhide was finally defeated.","popularity":0.3645,"poster_path":"/5mmAMvKCkoEqHpMKsM7MsSxkxaa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192,"logo_path":"/93eAKlnQecDdMtucfOprzcjMw9V.png","name":"Shochiku","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ehon Taikōki - Amagasaki Kankyo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1605585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kasho Nakamura II","original_name":"二代目 中村歌昇","popularity":0.1111,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6228764c2f7915001b74d3c2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3458647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yonekichi Nakamura V","original_name":"Yonekichi Nakamura V","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"622879a6cdbaff001da50737","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3458648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baika Nakamura","original_name":"Baika Nakamura","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"622879cfa6d931004623b83b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3458650,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shikan Nakamura VIII","original_name":"Shikan Nakamura VIII","popularity":0.15,"profile_path":"/ynUYolvgkAG5ozgf3ylIdJEu4Mk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"622879e8e24e3a001dd3f09b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3458651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shingo Bando","original_name":"坂東新悟","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62287a0ecdbaff004777c1fd","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3458652,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kinnosuke Nakamura II","original_name":"二代目中村錦之助","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62287a2e0a517c00475d07a3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4380750,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hayato Nakamura","original_name":"中村隼人","popularity":0.1823,"profile_path":"/noVs5yh9fFK6sZb1NxHNyXmFva0.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6556719a67b61345dbc15bfa","order":6}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7RAChr2ry8ydC8Qd0ioEc8MRsN5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1590,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5mmAMvKCkoEqHpMKsM7MsSxkxaa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1060}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":197915,"name":"kabuki"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
