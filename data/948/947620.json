Two are single fathers coping with parental responsibilities. Frank is a founding member of Act Up, who dedicated himself to the organization over the years, and who has paid a price in the course of his commitment. Bob juggles businesses, trying to make a new start, while Mike wrestles with a past that encompasses family tragedy, alcoholism and drug addiction. Keep Moving considers how these men understand their histories while pressing forward, and how they received and pass on fundamental values.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/lMi4XWZeGj1vxeNE8PzRn97nQc2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keep Moving","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3459139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Goodale","original_name":"Bob Goodale","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6228f6a71bf266004619397b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3459141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Smithson","original_name":"Frank Smithson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6228f6af2f1be00045aed134","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3459142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Laffan","original_name":"Mike Laffan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6228f6b60a517c0068be6465","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228f6bf28723c006fe211c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228f6c655c1f4001a5a1ed5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228f6ce1130bd0067c72db0","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3008308,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dennis Day","original_name":"Dennis Day","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228f6e30a517c0068be64f6","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228f6ed871b34001dee2b5d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lMi4XWZeGj1vxeNE8PzRn97nQc2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
