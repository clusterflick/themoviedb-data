A horrifying tale of lies, deception and the high cost of justice, Every Family’s Nightmare raises questions about systemic, procedural and cultural flaws in Australia’s criminal justice system by investigating the case of Perth schoolboy Patrick Waring.  Patrick was jailed for a year while his family battled to prove his innocence. From the time he was accused of raping a teenage girl on 30 March 2006, the Western Australian police were convinced Patrick Waring was guilty. His family knew they were wrong. Over the next year, the Waring family assembled an international team of experts to help defend their son, exposing deep flaws in the police investigation and the legal battle that followed.  Alarmingly, experts say that the same situation could arise at any time, involving any family, in any Australian state.","popularity":0.0689,"poster_path":"/dlpEfwjueiZkOTLwkDIIiiwubOr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Lies, Deception and the Cost of Justice","title":"Every Family's Nightmare","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3460868,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Muntz","original_name":"Michael Muntz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622ac0f8109cd0001bf5665f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732779,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ed Punchard","original_name":"Ed Punchard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622ac113726fb1006f9cb4b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1732777,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julia Redwood","original_name":"Julia Redwood","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622ac12084591c00460db8cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8160708","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1754,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dlpEfwjueiZkOTLwkDIIiiwubOr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1239}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"M","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
