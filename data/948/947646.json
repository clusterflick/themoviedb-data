As a pioneer in the world plastic surgery and a militant feminist from the early 20th century, Suzanne Noël has recently become a popular figure. ​“Plastic surgery” and ​“feminism”, two notions one would not expect to see side by side. In Paris, from the Belle Epoque through the Roaring Twenties by way of the First World War, this film explores the unconventional and extraordinary journey of Suzanne, a woman who dreams of freedom while being referred to by many as ​“doubly insane”.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Suzanne","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1956245,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Anaïs Caura","original_name":"Anaïs Caura","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228fdad41a5610044f28533","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1474296,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joëlle Oosterlinck","original_name":"Joëlle Oosterlinck","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228fdebe92d83004842f4dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
