As the story unfolds, it veers from the objective to the highly personal. The tape relates the story of Mel Glasser, a recovering schizophrenic who, having adopted the persona of Abraham Lincoln, has made considerable progress in the last twenty years. The tape refuses to romanticize Mel's condition; he speaks frankly with intelligence and humour, and takes Applegath on a special journey.","popularity":0.0578,"poster_path":"/5TJE0jlHGNuMCyeBx8oFiaw0PZt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Escaping History","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3459145,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mel Glasser","original_name":"Mel Glasser","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6228f84401757f0048c13794","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228f85acdbaff0069d81643","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228f8520a517c0068be69c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228f861e92d83004842e23a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228f86bd2c0c1004618f330","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1018196,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lorraine Dufour","original_name":"Lorraine Dufour","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228f896cdbaff0069d81766","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3008308,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dennis Day","original_name":"Dennis Day","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228f87928723c0046ded34a","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3459146,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Josette Bélanger","original_name":"Josette Bélanger","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228f88c28723c006fe2193e","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2826740,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Konrad Skreta","original_name":"Konrad Skreta","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228f8832f1be00045aed839","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5TJE0jlHGNuMCyeBx8oFiaw0PZt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
