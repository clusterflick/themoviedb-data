Forced to work in a soap factory, she endures the harshness of working-class conditions. She awkwardly shouts her revolt and finds herself on the street. When she lands in the lap of a wealthy cabaret owner who understands her talent as a lyricist, she gets a taste of the Paris of the Belle Époque. But faced with the repression that falls on the Zone and her family, she has to choose: become a singing star or stand up for her family.","popularity":0.049,"poster_path":"/m3xt10PLYiBJxZVudilqwUSla1b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Fleur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1483807,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rémi Chayé","original_name":"Rémi Chayé","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/o3hy7GSHgUz1nBaNbWo5qOxu232.jpg","credit_id":"6228c72be24e3a0047db2914","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/m3xt10PLYiBJxZVudilqwUSla1b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
