The people we encounter persist in giving sense to their environment which often seems hostile to their concerns. At the boyhood home of Davy Crockett, we encounter his modern day advocate; across the street is a small businessman who sells \"Davy Dogs\" and tries to keep a failing business afloat. From here, we move across America meeting others who live on the edge of the American dream.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/nJGbYjjCNTH4xYxngtdHdBVFaRW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75133,"logo_path":null,"name":"School of the Art Institute of Chicago","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Open Season","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228fbf7d2c0c10068bdb8da","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228fbed0a517c00475e7caa","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228fbe71130bd0045df5b25","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228fbe1cdbaff001da639d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nJGbYjjCNTH4xYxngtdHdBVFaRW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
