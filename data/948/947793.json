The film takes as its starting point the trade and immigration routes between India and Africa. Jangbar will use research and real events to create a fictional film, formed around a non-linear narrative told through sound and image. The filming focuses on architecture and landscape, as well as the body, language, voice and dialogue - a new development in the artist's practice.  Co-supporters  Jangbar was co-produced with Artsadmin and supported by New Art Exchange Nottingham.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jangbar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3459597,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zarina Bhimji","original_name":"Zarina Bhimji","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62296270069f0e00702bda95","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Jangbar Press Clip","key":"146612658","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-11-23T08:38:19.000Z","id":"622960929a3c490047cb93bc"}]}}}
