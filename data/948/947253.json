The film traces multiple journeys made by the participants towards defining their identities and towards forming the Kala Raksha Trust and the School for Design. The film uses their narrative art of appliqu√© and embroideries through which they articulate their responses to life, and events as traumatic as the earthquake and as joyful as flying a kite. Through conversations and memories four voices share their involvement in the evolution of a craft tradition.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2010-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stitches Speak","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2697836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amit Thakkar","original_name":"Amit Thakkar","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6227dc47d2c0c10068ba9ad8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3426166,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bharati Bahrani","original_name":"Bharati Bahrani","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6227dc541130bd0067c421bb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3458110,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dhaivat Shukla","original_name":"Dhaivat Shukla","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6227dc3455c1f40047a25817","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3426160,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Ketki Saxena","original_name":"Ketki Saxena","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6227dca4d2c0c10046161b64","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3458112,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Juny Wilfred","original_name":"Juny Wilfred","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6227dcb50d5d85006e4827a4","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2699182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Sabnani","original_name":"Nina Sabnani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bW1bzG8fnt3MlA0DucAOKxB91IR.jpg","credit_id":"6227dc1ccdbaff001da3656f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2699182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Sabnani","original_name":"Nina Sabnani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bW1bzG8fnt3MlA0DucAOKxB91IR.jpg","credit_id":"6227dc23b76cbb0045674205","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2699182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Sabnani","original_name":"Nina Sabnani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bW1bzG8fnt3MlA0DucAOKxB91IR.jpg","credit_id":"6227dc6d0d5d85006e4826a3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3458111,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Sachin Dutt","original_name":"Sachin Dutt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6227dc801130bd0045dc3586","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1735502","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
