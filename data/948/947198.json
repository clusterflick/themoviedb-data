It starts with a stormy debate between a man and his conscience. Torn between a rational approach and his desire to go his own way, he finally sets out on a initiatory journey that will end on a desert island. To see into the distance, he builds a lighthouse that will become his ivory tower, while the sea around him becomes the repository of his fantasies of wealth, love and glory. The Lighthouse is a visual feast. A wealth of technical and artistic inventiveness enriches the storyline. An animated film without words.","popularity":0.0465,"poster_path":"/qEP4Lb6U9AHtTaR2rsJU0ouWOL6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1997-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lighthouse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1975782,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre Veilleux","original_name":"Pierre Veilleux","popularity":0.001,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6227ab9d1bf26600667a0e6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0308722","wikidata_id":"Q49826730","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1620,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qEP4Lb6U9AHtTaR2rsJU0ouWOL6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
