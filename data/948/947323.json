His daughter. Nell, is known and liked by all the cowboys of the surrounding ranches. Jack Harding is especially fond of Nell. Old man Wilson fears Jack. The manager of the ranch on which Jack works is negotiating with a livestock exchange relative to the sale of a bunch of horses, and accordingly, the buyer of the exchange, Neal Banning, arrives on the ground, accompanied by his daughter, to look over the stock. Jack finds the city-bred girl very fascinating, while she finds much to admire in the young cowboy. The two take many rides together, in which Jack explains the country and the business of the livestock people to the girl. Nell notices the growing intimacy between the two, and is very down-hearted over it.","popularity":0.1604,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52438,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bison Motion Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1916-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stampede in the Night","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":538370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hoot Gibson","original_name":"Hoot Gibson","popularity":0.5064,"profile_path":"/gtDdTrKTNy26xJVUeJpdFmZvZWf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Jack Harding","credit_id":"62280ce735818f006c38bd63","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olive Carey","original_name":"Olive Carey","popularity":0.3417,"profile_path":"/8nun3DoEza3OmxMwcmMYlrQkINv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Nell Wilson","credit_id":"62280cf60d5d850047a24ebc","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2306709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Canfield","original_name":"William Canfield","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Old Wilson - Nell's Father","credit_id":"62280d072f1be00045ac966c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1317660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neal Hart","original_name":"Neal Hart","popularity":0.0977,"profile_path":"/1eFyB2wHwurFmpV2LQ1rptyfMg9.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Neil Banning","credit_id":"62280d1441a561001bd08350","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3456330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peggy Coudray","original_name":"Peggy Coudray","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Banning's Daughter","credit_id":"62280d23e92d83001b903acc","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Jaccard","original_name":"Jacques Jaccard","popularity":0.1355,"profile_path":"/c0UJU3G96Sh1mEjIOp0azEeptUa.jpg","credit_id":"62280cc101757f006a2a7efc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Carey","original_name":"Harry Carey","popularity":0.2712,"profile_path":"/AvNDsYjkLgeFHbxGFIFyl6QRgeM.jpg","credit_id":"62280ccd2f1be00045ac95a0","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170723,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacques Jaccard","original_name":"Jacques Jaccard","popularity":0.1355,"profile_path":"/c0UJU3G96Sh1mEjIOp0azEeptUa.jpg","credit_id":"62280cd7a6d931001cbedf0f","department":"Writing","job":"Scenario Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0007389","wikidata_id":"Q7597487","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1916-02-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
