Over six years, they rowed a fair distance. breakSurface documents these travels, and the extent to which Greer’s world is leavened with debilitating anxiety. Greer’s powerful sculpture is visually simple, conceptually complex, but silent; he identifies with Jonathan Swift’s \"man of objects\" who lays out things, not words, to be understood. Applegath, however, doesn’t make this film to replace words, but by embracing them.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/sWDps3ublGrT9BIAu4yoRINywjz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"breakSurface","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3459230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Greer","original_name":"John Greer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62290256d2c0c10068bdcf48","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6229025e28723c001b69863d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6229027155c1f40047a5c2b3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62290279c1606a0046a3ef90","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"622902800a517c0068be8d9f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3459143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Stewart Applegath","original_name":"Stewart Applegath","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6229026ad2c0c1001c13a2b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sWDps3ublGrT9BIAu4yoRINywjz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
