Between the modern and the traditional, between the fabulous and the real. The story about a little girl Anna, her unusual friends — magical creatures from Norwegian folklore, their dreams, adventures, challenges and friendship. Where the fairy tale intertwines with the reality and is more real than the modern material world. Relationships with friends, parent-child relationship problems. Is what we want for our children really better for them? But what are they really dreaming about? And what makes them happy?","popularity":0.0588,"poster_path":"/kcPgEUfeCPhKkV6XtfccOmHPg9U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Magical Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3458978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalia Malykhi­na Bratli","original_name":"Natalia Malykhi­na Bratli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6228d322d2c0c1001c12fda4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2560,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kcPgEUfeCPhKkV6XtfccOmHPg9U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
