It recounts the grand sacrifice ritual organized by Daksha, where his daughter Sati, wife of Lord Shiva, tragically immolates herself due to her father's insult to her husband. Enraged by this, Shiva destroys the sacrifice, leading to the creation of the Shakti Pithas. This event also sets the stage for the reincarnation of Sati as Parvati, who later marries Shiva. The story is central to understanding the complexities of Hindu deities and their interactions.","popularity":0.1814,"poster_path":"/eg20E80RVA0PZJBtELv64jtDOZl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170665,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radha Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1934-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dakshayagna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Daksha Yagna","type":"Hindi"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Ritual Fire","type":"English"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1480331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dhiraj Bhattacharya","original_name":"Dhiraj Bhattacharya","popularity":0.094,"profile_path":"/1lEB6BczSeB2sWGwyCyCpO4ORvk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mahadev","credit_id":"62285f5301757f001e3d46d5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1124677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tulsi Chakraborty","original_name":"Tulsi Chakraborty","popularity":0.1551,"profile_path":"/rRyitVbDqnP8pnq1KYfelSD2PNJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Brahma","credit_id":"62285f60e92d83001b913d77","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1690382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ahindra Choudhury","original_name":"Ahindra Choudhury","popularity":0.0507,"profile_path":"/3rqIKd89pAg1fNhBNV5hxVzjQ7A.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Dakhshya","credit_id":"62285f6fe92d83001b913d82","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1415357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chandrabati Devi","original_name":"Chandrabati Devi","popularity":0.0762,"profile_path":"/j5OvsRlgMbhhRQJ8iNiHKs8gHc6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sati","credit_id":"62285f781bf26600667c827e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3444917,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mrinal Ghosh","original_name":"Mrinal Ghosh","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Narad","credit_id":"62285f80871b34001decd6c6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3458576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kumar Mitra","original_name":"Kumar Mitra","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Priest","credit_id":"62285f9ffd140b001bae097e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4883436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jyotsna Mitra","original_name":"Jyotsna Mitra","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"66bb78a7d955793cd207ae7e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4571839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rabi Ray","original_name":"Rabi Ray","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"66bb78b04a850a1bb51a72b1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4883439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janaki Bhattacharya","original_name":"Janaki Bhattacharya","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"66bb78d907f47d9e3253c1b4","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4883440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saroj Bagchi","original_name":"Saroj Bagchi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"66bb78e965a0a0968a1a79fb","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1323471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Radharani","original_name":"Radharani","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"66bb792d48051c87c064aac8","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2727945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jyotish Bandyopadhyay","original_name":"Jyotish Bannerjee","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/wmPsrYeS9cGAENfb1k21InB6bGd.jpg","credit_id":"62285f380d5d850047a3448f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4883449,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Shankar Ghuraji Kaskar","original_name":"Shankar Ghuraji Kaskar","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66bb798107f47d9e3253c1dd","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2727945,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jyotish Bandyopadhyay","original_name":"Jyotish Bannerjee","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/wmPsrYeS9cGAENfb1k21InB6bGd.jpg","credit_id":"66bb794a429b1f721abdb453","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3458595,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"D.G.
