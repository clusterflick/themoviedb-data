The county is protected from the Confederacy by an abolitionist and a Native American gentleman. The abolitionist's daughter is courted by a powerful newspaper publisher when her fiance, a confederate officer, elopes with the girl's sister. The daughter at first resists the publisher's attentions, but turns to him for aid when her ex-fiance plans to capture the seceding county on behalf of the South.","popularity":2.3063,"poster_path":"/844Gez3RtTvbAgb3b9SGWp24H1V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10096,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walter Wanger
