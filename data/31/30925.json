This unique documentary examines the creative spirit that drives these indie graphic artists. They pick through the dregs of America's schizophrenic culture and piece them back together. What you end up with is a caricature of the black and bloated heart that pulses greed through the US economy. The artists push further into the pulp to grab the attention of passersby, plastering art that's both vulgar and intensely visceral onto the gnarled surfaces of the urban landscape.","popularity":0.0507,"poster_path":"/i4gVkMs80mB8CoVDYsPCm2orY59.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":217520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Norotomo Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A movie About Rock Posters","title":"Died Young, Stayed Pretty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3062433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eileen Yaghoobian","original_name":"Eileen Yaghoobian","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b677ee0d2944017f5af740","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3062433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eileen Yaghoobian","original_name":"Eileen Yaghoobian","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b6784fb6cff1017cf7fa7e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1330529","wikidata_id":"Q15052379","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/i4gVkMs80mB8CoVDYsPCm2orY59.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1296,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sO0gs8wthOuTy2s0qZpP1uqobEu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":864}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
