Formed in 2000, with a mutual fascination for the glory days of death metal, the band's line up boasts an all-star cast. Anders Nyström and Jonas Renkse (Katatonia), Mikael Akerfeldt (Opeth) and musician and producer extraordinaire Dan Swanö are joined by Martin \"Axe\" Axenrot, also from Opeth, for 'The Wacken Carnage'. 'The Wacken Carnage' features Bloodbath on relentless form at a rare live appearance captured on 6th August 2005 at the infamous Wacken Festival, Germany, with the unmistakable vocal prowess of Mikael Akerfeldt backed up by a solid wall of buzzsaw death metal riffing. Bloodbath pulverise the senses (and the audience) with a stream of classics spanning their recording career to date.","popularity":0.1837,"poster_path":"/2GnHWERAepaz1R58d7BNAAl6BaE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135955,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peaceville Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2008-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bloodbath: The Wacken Carnage","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikael Åkerfeldt","original_name":"Mikael Åkerfeldt","popularity":0.0675,"profile_path":"/uJv9TWl96SmPMHgPuAz7Gay5ttT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself (Vocals)","credit_id":"52fe441b9251416c91005069","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anders \"Blakkheim\" Nyström","original_name":"Anders \"Blakkheim\" Nyström","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":"/obKoPdWN6d1dvIdbfQWMTrK9XLX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself (Guitar, Backing Vocals)","credit_id":"52fe441b9251416c9100506d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonas Renkse","original_name":"Jonas Renkse","popularity":0.1139,"profile_path":"/eizlZxTnW7QzE6OxTqYNu7UFaID.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself (Bass)","credit_id":"52fe441b9251416c91005071","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":106331,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Swanö","original_name":"Dan Swanö","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself (Guitar, Backing Vocals)","credit_id":"52fe441b9251416c91005075","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106332,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin \"Axe\" Axenrot","original_name":"Martin \"Axe\" Axenrot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/nW9QdUOHRV4X7oRnGlrG5TUHd5D.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself (Drums)","credit_id":"52fe441b9251416c91005079","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2848321,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Andreas Puschel","original_name":"Andreas Puschel","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa818b29ac535003fb87d93","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1549550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ronald Matthes","original_name":"Ronald Matthes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa818718c7b0f004179b79f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2848328,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Norbert Kuntz","original_name":"Norbert Kuntz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fa8192d6a300b003cf388ca","department":"Production","job":"Production Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2GnHWERAepaz1R58d7BNAAl6BaE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":204425,"name":"death metal"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2008-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
