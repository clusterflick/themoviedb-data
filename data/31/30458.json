Consequently, Boris is subject to hallucinations and all-too-real social lapses which normally involve sadistic harm to beautiful naked young women. His butler is sworn to indoctrinating him into the evils of the family line, and their castle's torture dungeon proves quite useful in this regard. However, Boris is periodically lured away from his destiny by the romantic apparition of the deceased countess who previously owned the castle.","popularity":0.5648,"poster_path":"/o6g6yk9kRe6FqblQCa0ilq4sQ7N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22251,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions du
