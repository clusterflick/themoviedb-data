After leading reconstruction teams in Baghdad and Fallujah, Kirk returns home only to discover that many of his former Iraqi colleagues are being killed, kidnapped or forced into exile by radical militias. Frustrated by a stagnating government bureaucracy in the U.S. that has failed to protect its 'Iraqi allies,' Kirk begins compiling a list of their names and helps them find refuge and a new life in America.","popularity":0.0903,"poster_path":"/xvnHN7ogP7X0qGVJkIO5bOGBEU5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One man shoulders the responsibility of a nation.","title":"The List","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":76859,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Beth Murphy","original_name":"Beth Murphy","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a8f9251416c750e6451","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2088933","wikidata_id":"Q7747532","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xvnHN7ogP7X0qGVJkIO5bOGBEU5.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
