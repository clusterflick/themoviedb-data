Over the course of a single day and night, M's solipsistic existence is shaken when his nephew kills a man in Nazareth, placing the entire family at risk of reprisals. This masterful feature - a quietly witty, complex and occasionally surreal depiction of an exile's relationship with Palestine - marks a new direction in Khleifi's work.","popularity":0.0407,"poster_path":"/mnzYKLYVo85YzVFuzI4AYEsLPDS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":219450,"logo_path":null,"name":"Euphoric Pictures","origin_country":"PS"},{"id":165529,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sindibad Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":165530,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sourat Films","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":219451,"logo_path":null,"name":"DEMO Completion Fund","origin_country":"AE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2009-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zindeeq","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1113146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mira Awad","original_name":"Mira Awad","popularity":0.1151,"profile_path":"/lDb7DrqfM6upWlcQ0q3jCYMl6Xn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a979251416c750e7699","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohammad Bakri","original_name":"Mohammad Bakri","popularity":0.251,"profile_path":"/bNF2O4TXDoF8sivoqvipeiCqVqu.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"M.","credit_id":"638e6d5bca0e170080472fb2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michel Khleifi","original_name":"Michel Khleifi","popularity":0.0771,"profile_path":"/nNFKJyneATjnmqnaV4URUvzDyE1.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a979251416c750e7695","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1559042","wikidata_id":"Q64679002","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mnzYKLYVo85YzVFuzI4AYEsLPDS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-08-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
