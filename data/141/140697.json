But there they fall in a trap of their own intention, and get stuck in the cargo elevator. There is no one around to hear them, and nobody knows their whereabouts. Tension arises after each failed attempt to escape, while they also have to deal with the fact that their entire universe is now reduced to a metal box smaller than a room.","popularity":0.0931,"poster_path":"/3dgVZL1D0LUZ3jwrqbosdhltZAT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11193,"logo_path":null,"name":"Keep Movieng","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2008-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elevator","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1025962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cristi Petrescu","original_name":"Cristi Petrescu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"The boy","credit_id":"52fe4a999251416c750e7a49","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1025963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iulia Verdes","original_name":"Iulia Verdes","popularity":0.097,"profile_path":"/hTnr8XPw1iTvQwOCowY3OSk4nWC.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The girl","credit_id":"52fe4a999251416c750e7a4d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1025964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Dorobantu","original_name":"George Dorobantu","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a999251416c750e7a53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1025965,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gabriel Pintilei","original_name":"Gabriel Pintilei","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a999251416c750e7a59","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1025964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Dorobantu","original_name":"George Dorobantu","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61720a56e323f3009381c8bc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1025965,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gabriel Pintilei","original_name":"Gabriel Pintilei","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61720a61d75bd60091a6ba64","department":"Production","job":"Casting"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1025965,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gabriel Pintilei","original_name":"Gabriel Pintilei","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61720a2dbf09d1002d8007b8","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1025964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Dorobantu","original_name":"George Dorobantu","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61720a6a1d0191002d73b151","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1989067,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ada Milea","original_name":"Ada Milea","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/mCymKn7ZGs92FVoBxPHbPN0mRUi.jpg","credit_id":"61720a45cadb6b002a1a2575","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1025964,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Dorobantu","original_name":"George Dorobantu","popularity":0.0509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61720a7d8ddc340044b0d3dd","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3279882,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexandra M.
