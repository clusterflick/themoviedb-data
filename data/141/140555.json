It weaves its way through a startling world of sound and silence, via the ears and brains of three extraordinary people as they try to rediscover music: a dancer deaf since birth, a young pianist who lost her hearing as a baby, and a music critic facing sudden partial deafness.  Music is one of the greatest of all human experiences; millions of us fall under its spell every day, and it engages more parts of the brain than any other human activity. But what if you lost the ability to hear it? Could you find music again... could music find you?","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost and Sound","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2241311","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
