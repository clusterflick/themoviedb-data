When it opened in September 2004 at the National Theatre PRIMO was instantly recognised as a major theatrical event. A work of astounding dramatic power it sheds a light on one of the darkest episodes in human history. Antony Sher's towering performance is as controlled as Primo Levi s own lucid prose. Beautifully directed by Richard Wilson and presented in Hildegard Bechtler's magnificent, symbolist set.","popularity":0.3639,"poster_path":"/kVxr1xClIyayhccAnuzNwKN3uMM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3346,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rainmark Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Primo","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antony Sher","original_name":"Antony Sher","popularity":0.2754,"profile_path":"/e0V4i0avYfcfZORkt1tuORrIkGS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Primo Levi","credit_id":"52fe4a9d9251416c750e833b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2253291,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Wilson","original_name":"Richard Wilson","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c78a9bac3a36844f11821b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0466932","wikidata_id":"Q7243598","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1688,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wTbH4kRY5SPIksT4HpB5p0kVw4l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":11.663,"height":83,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tpP88sPAnG0PBfw2nG71GEDYpIQ.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":968}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hW0AQt2OG33oLdDJnTSiB6ZwbCg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kVxr1xClIyayhccAnuzNwKN3uMM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
