Through the '90s, McConkey battled the odds and the establishment as he put \"fun\" back in skiing. With an unprecedented manner of attacking mountains and a committed effort to appear ridiculous, McConkey opened the doors to a new way of thinking and skiing. As attention to his feats and antics blossomed, so did the sport around him. We've teamed up the raddest skiers of today with the past decade's most influential skier and biggest idiot. So sit back for a wacky, whirlwind tour through a man, a mind and a sport. You may never look at skiing the same way again.","popularity":0.1502,"poster_path":"/1Ly33oeJW1ea5WEryMiiV9VnJ5t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3755,"logo_path":"/krZgEDPup3ejRjIpGBtmK49jzSc.png","name":"Matchstick Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There's Something About McConkey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shane McConkey","original_name":"Shane McConkey","popularity":0.1328,"profile_path":"/f8c978D2CcqnLqTf6BZEnThEOMr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6509150ff90b19011d2b4dc7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":124069,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seth Morrison","original_name":"Seth Morrison","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/nSUpX8xMxGDFhln5kdVHFRpEZJe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"650915273cd12c014ec07401","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":141686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonny Moseley","original_name":"Jonny Moseley","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/9X0Ijw5PAvsMeZQlkSWAKYNCkUp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6509153f8a88b200c6adcd5c","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2188929","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1Ly33oeJW1ea5WEryMiiV9VnJ5t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
