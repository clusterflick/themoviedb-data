Jim departs just ahead of the Sherrif with drunken Shanks, and his companion Sally (Gates). Shanks takes off into a small Mexican village after a fight with Jim, stranding both Sally and him with no money. Two local men hear of Jim's plight, and offer him money to smuggle a batch of illegal aliens, called Wetbacks, into the U.S. He agrees but is blackmailed into continuing to run the smuggling operation. Afraid, Jim decides to make a run for it, but someone close to him reveals themselves as a US Immigration agent and asks him to assist them in shutting down the smugglers for good.","popularity":1.2856,"poster_path":"/2xZSuqN0LjYSHgxPQFj34Yd2LdX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14040,"logo_path":null,"name":"Banner Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1956-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"BORDER TRAFFIC IN HUMAN LIVES!","title":"Wetbacks","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Menschenjagd im Pazifik","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Bridges","original_name":"Lloyd Bridges","popularity":1.0226,"profile_path":"/3dUJhLyaOl32mOU9HBpgTniLNJc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jim Benson","credit_id":"52fe4a919251416c750e6917","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":18582,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Gates","original_name":"Nancy Gates","popularity":0.3371,"profile_path":"/3jOEc0j4THNk9RCzKdCzSxEz8Zd.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Sally Parker","credit_id":"52fe4a919251416c750e691b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barton MacLane","original_name":"Barton MacLane","popularity":0.2158,"profile_path":"/5lrfsloSoznUSZWf9NYywYRLtDW.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Karl Shanks","credit_id":"52fe4a919251416c750e691f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Hoyt","original_name":"John Hoyt","popularity":0.8292,"profile_path":"/rtm0wKVwtsn8dyBHPQB9jWlSIcT.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Steve Bodine","credit_id":"52fe4a929251416c750e6923","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Peary","original_name":"Harold Peary","popularity":0.2091,"profile_path":"/zh1IOcd813geZzUVJcWngUZGgQM.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Juan Ortega","credit_id":"52fe4a929251416c750e6927","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nacho Galindo","original_name":"Nacho Galindo","popularity":0.1429,"profile_path":"/bfIr5RF1MrRXRZuJFqNUQ4YhVD.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Alfonso","credit_id":"5f1bb01d66a7c30038fe18ec","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Keys","original_name":"Robert Keys","popularity":0.1093,"profile_path":"/81dtPLoZZoFAojVfpwaHHRUO8tL.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Reeser","credit_id":"5f1bb04b223a8b0037eaa6e6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salvador Baguez","original_name":"Salvador Baguez","popularity":0.078,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Mexican Policeman","credit_id":"5f1bb07aaf58cb00354279f0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":190781,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jose Gonzales-Gonzales","original_name":"Jose Gonzales-Gonzales","popularity":0.1162,"profile_path":"/d6UdOwjIcxszhMRbJNRa6YIxzmj.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Wetback","credit_id":"5f1bb09a1b1f3c00366eeaf9","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Jean Heydt","original_name":"Louis Jean Heydt","popularity":0.248,"profile_path":"/6FPH4YZILpyarstBBIWcA4wpArJ.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Coast Guard Comdr.
