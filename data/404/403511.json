It's been a while since we last heard from Zebrahead, but the Orange County, California-based band is making their presence felt once again with Blood Sweat &amp; Beers a live DVD shot in Tokyo as the band toured their highly successful \"MFZB\" album (GOLF, 2004). Revitalized, road-tightened and eager to redefine their focus, the quintet comes out swinging, delivering a flurry of pummeling rhythms, clench-fisted chords and meaty hooks that connect with each listen. Razor-sharp rockers like \"Rescue Me\" &amp; crowd pleasing favorites like \"Playmate Of The Year\" are all on show here as well as songs from all of the bands albums as they perform for a rabid audience. This DVD shows all the electrifying energy of a live Zebrahead show, blending raging tempos and ringing guitar lines into surging, insistent choruses that stick after a single listen.","popularity":0.0635,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zebrahead - Blood, Sweat & Beers!!! - Live In Tokyo Japan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
