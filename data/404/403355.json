Magdalena finds herself consumed by a grief she cannot overcome. Although the event has shattered her world, she nonetheless manages to ‘function’ smoothly on a daily basis – whether this involves trying to sell Sara’s dog Truls, picking up her second daughter’s son from his piano lesson, eating with the family of an evening, attending a session with a spiritualist or going to a bar. These are all things she would have done anyway, and a strict routine helps prevent her pain from rising to the surface. Only when Sara’s former boyfriend visits does she begin to see a path through all her denial, speechlessness and feelings of guilt.","popularity":0.2318,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lamento","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":232471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gunilla Röör","original_name":"Gunilla Röör","popularity":0.2348,"profile_path":"/iCFEvmTxftD3WVDxa2l51PGtCs6.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5877938bc3a36850ec0074a6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1737581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hendrik Kraft","original_name":"Hendrik Kraft","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"587793a1c3a36850ec0074ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135724,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Björn Andersson","original_name":"Björn Andersson","popularity":0.1205,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"587793bec3a36850f5009b1e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1295285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Huldt","original_name":"Sandra Huldt","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"587793df92514110470076c0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andreas Kundler","original_name":"Andreas Kundler","popularity":0.0879,"profile_path":"/moGgEuJIybWvccLIhXXjkdV8QIJ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"587793f4925141103e007ee8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon J.
