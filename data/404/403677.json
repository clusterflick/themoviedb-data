The meeting was held in Bologna.  The choice of the name of the event, V-Day, had a threefold reference: the first to the landing operation (D-Day) of the Allies in Normandy during World War II, to symbolize how Italian citizens would \"invade\" bad policy; the second to the motion picture \"V for Vendetta\" (whose symbol is also referred to in the logo of the movement) which the movement refers to often with its principles of political renewal; the third to the interjection \"Fuck you\" given to bad policy.","popularity":0.0993,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"V-Day","title":"V-Day 2007","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beppe Grillo","original_name":"Beppe Grillo","popularity":0.1501,"profile_path":"/Aje4Yuf00ccLm7wzt4pwo0gNHSM.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"576eb22bc3a36874d8000299","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2007-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
