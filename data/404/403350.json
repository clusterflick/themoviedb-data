Created by Brunswick Films, which was behind the 1970-79 Grand Prix Collection, each DVD profiles a racing great, with action footage and period interviews from the Brunswick archive which reveal why these names still cause excitement today. They are not detailed life stories, but celebrations of the driving skills and colourful characters which defined a motor racing era. This DVD remembers Ronnie Peterson. Regarded as one of the best drivers never to have won the World Championship, Ronnie Peterson was the nearly man of Formula One. More naturally talented than Mario Andretti, an agreement he would always play second string to the American ensured he always played the supporting role. Archive film recalls an amazing career which came to a tragic and early end at Monza.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ronnie Peterson - Grand Prix Hero","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2011-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
