Wandering through Christchurch’s eerie post-quake CBD, Bruce Russell, a sound artist and founding member of seminal noise band The Dead C, philosophises on urbanisation and regeneration through improvised soundscapes and his own highly evolved thought patterns. And navigating a fraught interior landscape, poet and actor David Hornblow uses Regression Hypnotherapy to traverse his past experiences with addiction. For Luxton and Agnew, their unique subjects’ journeys into the unknown have galvanised their own approach to the aesthetic of this adventurous film, earthy in tone and form and sublimely realised as a visual poem.","popularity":0.1059,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On An Unknown Beach","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1531683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Summer Agnew","original_name":"Summer Agnew","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6334e858378062007dccb844","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Luxton","original_name":"Adam Luxton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6334e851afe224007e1b0de8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1531683,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Summer Agnew","original_name":"Summer Agnew","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5768a33ac3a3680d5b0007e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638949,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Peter Wright","original_name":"Peter Wright","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5768a3c9c3a3680df200078d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638945,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ande Schurr","original_name":"Ande Schurr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5768a38ec3a3680eaf000860","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alistair Galbraith","original_name":"Alistair Galbraith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5768a39ec3a368025e00095c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638947,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Hornblow","original_name":"David Hornblow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5768a3abc3a3680e52000870","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638944,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Loughnan","original_name":"Daniel Loughnan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5768a37dc3a3680eaf000857","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638948,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bruce Russell","original_name":"Bruce Russell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5768a3b7c3a3680eaf00086e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Luxton","original_name":"Adam Luxton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5768a3309251414b99000838","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Luxton","original_name":"Adam Luxton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5768a35ec3a3680e5200085e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"NZIFF","release_date":"2016-06-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
