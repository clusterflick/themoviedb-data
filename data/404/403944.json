Like much of Ungerer’s work, the 10-minute Monarda explores the mystifying qualities of nature. Beginning with a shot of grass, Ungerer quickly abstracts his images through digital manipulation until they are barely recognizable. Traces of natural forms (leaves, twigs) ground what is an otherwise indescribable procession of images. Though the visuals evade literal synopsizing, there’s a simplicity and concision to the film that allows the viewer to get caught up in their own experience rather than get sidetracked on decoding the filmmaker’s intentions. Monarda instills a feeling of both apprehension and wonder in the viewer. It’s a disquieting film, but one whose subtle craft and atmosphere becomes more impressive over multiple viewings.","popularity":0.0517,"poster_path":"/7Jw9fX8ZSQmLH1y3kSOoiOeJpMc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monarda","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Ungerer","original_name":"Walter Ungerer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5770c8ad9251412a060016f5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1740138","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":940,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Jw9fX8ZSQmLH1y3kSOoiOeJpMc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":627}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
