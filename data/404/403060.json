After being fired by his father, arguing with his girlfriend in front of their daughter, and then a visit to the local pub, Eli decides to get out of town. On a lonely mountain highway Eli misses a turn and careens over an embankment, landing deep in the forest. It is a place of mystery with no way out, but it is there where God works on his heart. Satan is not far behind of course, working to convince Eli to take a different path. In the end Eli is faced with a choice that will have repercussions on generations as his destiny is to be the Billy Graham of his time.","popularity":0.5041,"poster_path":"/5Rbe0RlshREMCFYlX4DOVwr7qJR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of the Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1664337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holden Goyette","original_name":"Holden Goyette","popularity":0.0816,"profile_path":"/nM1Z7SMlrvqPJ4liH3peecAblqc.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Young Eli","credit_id":"57ab8022c3a368519c00332c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":117906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Elliott Davis","original_name":"Adam Elliott Davis","popularity":0.0512,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Eli Isaacson","credit_id":"57ab814ec3a368519c0033d5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Greene","original_name":"Graham Greene","popularity":2.6524,"profile_path":"/c0Hbq95FMlfGElLqxUN8Dk7ra3e.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gabe","credit_id":"57ab81bbc3a36850f50033ff","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89339,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lewis","original_name":"John Lewis","popularity":0.0876,"profile_path":"/tEpBURhEttWGiBHZH8fjI5SEJZ4.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Ranger Haase","credit_id":"57ab823092514149e400346c","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1084768,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shawn Justice","original_name":"Shawn Justice","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ab8074c3a368278700412d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1084768,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Shawn Justice","original_name":"Shawn Justice","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57ab80e0c3a36850f5003389","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5103904","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Rbe0RlshREMCFYlX4DOVwr7qJR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":253695,"name":"christian film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
