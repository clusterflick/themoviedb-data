They were signed to a major label and playing sold out tours around the world. A Divorce Before Marriage picks up the story five years later where, due to the decline of the music industry and a change in their fortune, the band are now in a very different position. Suddenly I Like Trains find themselves lost in a very different musical landscape as jobs, family and life start to take over, forcing them to question their childhood dreams and ambitions. Told over a period of 4 years, this is a coming of age story about a band stuck in the middle.","popularity":0.0625,"poster_path":"/77SqILxrS14AKNdzkUxEZdUpsss.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Divorce Before Marriage","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1755954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Matt Hopkins","original_name":"Matt Hopkins","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589f7ed7c3a3684fcd002825","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1755955,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ben Lankester","original_name":"Ben Lankester","popularity":0.3227,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589f7ee8c3a3684fca002a23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1755956,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Matt Shaw","original_name":"Matt Shaw","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"589f7f7b925141336e002bad","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542374,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joe Mount","original_name":"Joe Mount","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6025e18503f0b6003de6954e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542374,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joe Mount","original_name":"Joe Mount","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6025e171efd3c2003f630b47","department":"Sound","job":"Supervising Sound Effects Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542374,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Joe Mount","original_name":"Joe Mount","popularity":0.0533,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6025e1929979d2003febbc43","department":"Sound","job":"Dialogue Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4063744","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wTld4nvpTMs7av46fvZp2nsn5Hx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/77SqILxrS14AKNdzkUxEZdUpsss.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
