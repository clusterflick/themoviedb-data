They come from California by Greyhound bus, from Vancouver by plane, and on foot from many parishes surrounding Montréal. What is the fame of this shrine, that it attracts the devout and the curious alike? The story is told by Brother Placide Vermandère of the Order of the Holy Cross, who was personally acquainted with Brother André, after whom the shrine's famous temple is named. Cameras follow a procession of the League of the Sacred Heart through the streets of the city to the famous sanctuary and show many of the religious observances conducted in the church, including Mass attended by invalids who come in the hope of being healed of various afflictions.","popularity":0.2819,"poster_path":"/qx9oIOS2jDhzMEH0LHgre6n63uL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1958-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pilgrimage","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085846,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Daly","original_name":"Tom Daly","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576d9f3392514140a50000be","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085846,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Daly","original_name":"Tom Daly","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576d9f5792514140a30000b3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1640898,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lucien Marleau","original_name":"Lucien Marleau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576d9f6ac3a3681ce80000f6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1087078,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"George Croll","original_name":"George Croll","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576d9f8592514140a50000da","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1034809,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Spotton","original_name":"John Spotton","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576d9f20c3a3681ced0000c5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1335592,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terence Macartney-Filgate","original_name":"Terence Macartney-Filgate","popularity":0.0936,"profile_path":"/dnGX2sB5M7pifl3JYT8qfKyE2MF.jpg","credit_id":"576d9efb92514140ab0000a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1639594,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frank Orban","original_name":"Frank Orban","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576d9f7892514140a00000be","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1637276,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stuart Baker","original_name":"Stuart Baker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576d9f95925141409d0000bd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1069454,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wolf Koenig","original_name":"Wolf Koenig","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/lwUJrNgPIMytPg8FZzjDdHOwzNH.jpg","credit_id":"576d9f17c3a3681ce10000ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":356422,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roman Kroitor","original_name":"Roman Kroitor","popularity":0.0661,"profile_path":"/UXB1hDtpvCaGUrf1PJ01IfZ7N7.jpg","credit_id":"576d9f0fc3a3681ce80000c5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1069454,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wolf Koenig","original_name":"Wolf Koenig","popularity":0.058,"profile_path":"/lwUJrNgPIMytPg8FZzjDdHOwzNH.jpg","credit_id":"58a24f93c3a36829020005e6","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1335592,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terence Macartney-Filgate","original_name":"Terence Macartney-Filgate","popularity":0.0936,"profile_path":"/dnGX2sB5M7pifl3JYT8qfKyE2MF.jpg","credit_id":"58a24f8ac3a368292a0005dc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0223927","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lGLg9ewVk4yWRkErRXmHaQKdSjR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1333}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qx9oIOS2jDhzMEH0LHgre6n63uL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6719,"name":"montreal, canada"},{"id":11001,"name":"religion"},{"id":226727,"name":"candid eye"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1958-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
