Structured around the ten most significant celestial bodies of the Milky Way, Apple Pie’s inquiry begins with the furthest point in our solar system, Pluto, as a lens back towards our home planet and the ‘mechanisms by which certain aspects of scientific knowledge are digested, appropriated and subsequently manifest within the general human complex’. Christopher Francis Schiel’s dry, functional narration brings a network of ideas about our existence into focus, while Hamilton’s visual tableaux, as an extension of his multifaceted practice, veer imaginatively between psychedelic imagery and performance art.","popularity":0.352,"poster_path":"/zDAAkQdwDyHvlp9Hc6QW6coKDzX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"},{"iso_3166_1":"WS","name":"Samoa"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apple Pie","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2497152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mere Tokorahi Boynton","original_name":"Mere Tokorahi Boynton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5e0e20f46dc6c000154cce5f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2497153,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muagututia Kelemete Fu'a","original_name":"Muagututia Kelemete Fu'a","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"5e0e21049974ee0015a66f1d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2497150,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ian Powell","original_name":"Ian Powell","popularity":0.1509,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0e2082c2f44b0011302207","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2497151,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"John Goff","original_name":"John Goff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e0e20c0fd4f8000175e72aa","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2729581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Hamilton","original_name":"Sam Hamilton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6759eeda9fe2066e69ea812a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6410634","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"","instagram_id":"","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jWx4aQdHsz4s5iazQvPlWLMkfHE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/viRtEnpEjiC4XFYnLF7GXfZrnAW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5jP1r3ATwxpAlnoGvClubP61kCE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bESjJNdQCOLUjAz7JHDeqGx7MYB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8HnH5nBgEekt7JLY20WyE6NYlk6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zDAAkQdwDyHvlp9Hc6QW6coKDzX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1706,"name":"experiment"},{"id":2658,"name":"new zealand"},{"id":11130,"name":"art house"},{"id":10583,"name":"performance art"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":15478,"name":"art gallery"},{"id":41608,"name":"cosmology"},{"id":160330,"name":"astronomy"},{"id":166676,"name":"contemporary art"},{"id":170487,"name":"essay film"},{"id":259948,"name":"complexity"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"NZIFF","release_date":"2016-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Apple Pie (Trailer) by Sam Hamilton","key":"172257952","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-06-26T00:31:52.000Z","id":"5de9d63a27d9cc0013e9c173"}]}}}
