It tells the story of the two studio sessions and three live shows that made up the Stripped project. This followed the conclusion of the mammoth Voodoo Lounge tour and found The Stones reimagining tracks from their back catalogue in pared back versions alongside a couple of carefully chosen covers in the studio and doing smaller scale club gigs to showcase these versions, which was a marked contrast to the huge arenas and stadiums that had hosted the Voodoo Lounge tour. This new version of the documentary includes previously unseen footage and lays bare the inner workings of both The Rolling Stones and of some of their best loved tracks. Revealing, intimate and moving, Totally Stripped is unmissable.","popularity":1.5311,"poster_path":"/2UX9nAD9s7TKkNLgluX9SjfhxSr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1995-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Rolling Stones: Totally Stripped","title":"The Rolling Stones: Totally Stripped","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Jagger","original_name":"Mick Jagger","popularity":0.6912,"profile_path":"/r1uFIYnBCDhIlqNbiTS4nDrjHrl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"576d7f5dc3a36857d6000346","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Richards","original_name":"Keith Richards","popularity":0.7344,"profile_path":"/t1oa5UsJMmrhNqCIks4jQnAYSQT.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"576d7f4bc3a368576c000368","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1429,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlie Watts","original_name":"Charlie Watts","popularity":0.1312,"profile_path":"/yZUiyOV9ImKLwAczuLd7TsImC1k.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"576d7f83c3a368570100034a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronnie Wood","original_name":"Ronnie Wood","popularity":0.3169,"profile_path":"/x9cPzzqEOLIuvwsqfqoDTdXeeny.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"576d7f8f9251410b17000384","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Nicholson","original_name":"Jack Nicholson","popularity":3.7004,"profile_path":"/hBHcQIEa6P48HQAlLZkh0eKSSkG.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"62ec2f9c2dc44e00608aa56a","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Mallet","original_name":"David Mallet","popularity":0.2402,"profile_path":"/z2QO0qUqJgSVEDAUKNUdVtnJrCx.jpg","credit_id":"62551153ef9d7200a52742b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":113488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Gable","original_name":"Jim Gable","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62551140aaec71006696b37a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christine Strand","original_name":"Christine Strand","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6255116d3c3ab0009bcecb9a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1449377,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Patrick Woodroffe","original_name":"Patrick Woodroffe","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/sywI8Srvh7fozPwzoOFEVoFE4Lj.jpg","credit_id":"6255117f3c3ab0005129802c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1187676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Gable","original_name":"Jim Gable","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625511307719d700512f57ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12828690","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iKPCdcrcSu8DIsKPmiUpL4CcD8R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sAu3icPizW3FSxHlw9KQCTyP4vg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2UX9nAD9s7TKkNLgluX9SjfhxSr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12990,"name":"singing"},{"id":184119,"name":"cult music band"},{"id":246377,"name":"music documentary"},{"id":311685,"name":"musicians"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-08-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
