'The Greenhorns' is an ode to their grit and entrepreneurial spirit, an exploration of sustainable agriculture, and an enticement to reclaim our national soil. The ninety minute feature is the culmination of well over 200 hours of original footage from all regions of the United States, as well as original animation by young urban farmer and artist Brooke Budner, and rare agricultural archival footage from the Prelinger Archives. Ultimately, The Greenhorns shows us how farmers can move out of the margins recent history has consigned them to, and back to the heart of the American food landscape.","popularity":0.4207,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Greenhorns","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2098835,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Severine von Tscharner Fleming","original_name":"Severine von Tscharner Fleming","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"5b640cd7925141404f041464","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3314915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Courtney","original_name":"Amy Courtney","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"self - Freewheelin Farm, Davenport, CA","credit_id":"6196658d9512e10088d82564","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3314921,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brock Fulmer","original_name":"Brock Fulmer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"self - Bay Area Meat CSA, Berkley, CA","credit_id":"6196662167b6130068a466d7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3314930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John & Stacy Brenner","original_name":"John & Stacy Brenner","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"selves - Broadturn Farm, Scarborough, ME","credit_id":"619666c167b613002bc03f67","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2976950,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Velez","original_name":"Chris Velez","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"self - Intermountain Nursery, Prather, CA","credit_id":"6196673f71458f00429332a1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3314932,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ned Conwell","original_name":"Ned Conwell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"self - Blue House Farm, Pescadero, CA","credit_id":"619667e4528b2e0044d58b58","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3314936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pilar Reber","original_name":"Pilar Reber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"self - Sunnyside Organic Nursery, N.
