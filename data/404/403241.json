The silence of solstice holds them together. Before a ritualized meal they each tell a story. Their stories are ominous, yet, as in the first OOBIELAND film (INTRODUCTION TO OOBIELAND), they are incomplete. Earlier, the titular mother has passed on her powers to a young woman. At the close of the film, this young woman enters the farmhouse and, with final simplicity, restores the old order.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Terrible Mother","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Oobieland IV","type":"informal alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1346556,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Ungerer","original_name":"Walter Ungerer","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"576a7c419251412bf100081e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3257346","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1972-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
