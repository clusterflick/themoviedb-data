Featuring everything from Status Quo-style boogie-rockers to technofied drill & bass meltdowns. Added to this they make rock & roll history by releasing an album and DVD simultaneously. The DVD holds twelve specially commissioned film shorts rendered in dizzying surround sound. This is an immaculately conceived pop masterpiece.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9cVoz9AoWhDZKO6tOUKO8RpfspN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Super Furry Animals - Rings Around The World","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9fJZQHP9hc5KZdbxyee3D6f5LHn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.657,"height":2181,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9cVoz9AoWhDZKO6tOUKO8RpfspN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1434}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"15","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
