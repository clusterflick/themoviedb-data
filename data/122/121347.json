The film begins with a session of solo sea crossings on the Piade site near Toulon. In the second part, Patrick Edlinger trains in Buoux before carving a solo route in this now famous climbing site. This mythical film in more than one way is considered the first climbing film, that is to say where climbing is an activity in itself and not a means of preparing for mountaineering. His media success was such that he propelled Patrick Edlinger to the rank of world star, and above all he made climbing known to the general public, and was even nominated for the César for best documentary short film.","popularity":0.1872,"poster_path":"/bHNF9JloGuJZ2ybVvvg6FL9KsRq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1117,"logo_path":"/2X2uFeObxawiAajNDOf3Mhri5Wg.png","name":"Antenne
