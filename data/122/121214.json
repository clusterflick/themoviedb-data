His quite abrupt artistic transformation from working with a microphone to a paintbrush in 1982 and his consequent move from the desert to the ocean meant even less direct contact with the outside world than before. Subsequently there is very little information about Don from this time onwards and this short black-and-white film made in 1993 is an unique opportunity to see and hear this unique man","popularity":0.3501,"poster_path":"/99m1taPlkImzCISxgnKmujNrHx9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don Van Vliet: Some YoYo Stuff","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073842,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Don Van Vliet","original_name":"Don Van Vliet","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/pDufx2CboQmcCi9RYMZCXfdpDus.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4a5dc3a368484e14f2e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1073843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sue Vliet","original_name":"Sue Vliet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/6WQzcZR7Oq8TMNStlvAZd0lbfrs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4a5dc3a368484e14f2e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Lynch","original_name":"David Lynch","popularity":1.7106,"profile_path":"/b6TnSpuqeOlbq7aHH9G4inmQ1v9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4a5dc3a368484e14f2eb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anton Corbijn","original_name":"Anton Corbijn","popularity":0.3159,"profile_path":"/tBr98AlA0vYHX1s2faMeatfab5O.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4a5dc3a368484e14f2ef","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45052,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anton Corbijn","original_name":"Anton Corbijn","popularity":0.3159,"profile_path":"/tBr98AlA0vYHX1s2faMeatfab5O.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a5dc3a368484e14f2df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588630,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Richard Bell","original_name":"Richard Bell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a5dc3a368484e14f2f5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073842,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Don Van Vliet","original_name":"Don Van Vliet","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/pDufx2CboQmcCi9RYMZCXfdpDus.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a5dc3a368484e14f2fb","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073844,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Daniel Goddard","original_name":"Daniel Goddard","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a5dc3a368484e14f301","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0319310","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/99m1taPlkImzCISxgnKmujNrHx9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1994-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"captain beefheart - Don Van Vliet  - Anton Corbijn- some yo yo  stuff.flv","key":"FTWfR7BF7iQ","published_at":"2011-06-22T04:37:26.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"533ec6e9c3a3685448008d45"}]}}}
