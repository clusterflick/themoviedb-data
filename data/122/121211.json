He finds his daughters older, and more distant than he imagined. His wife still has the same smile. Having saved some earnings from two trips to the US, he hopes to now finally make a better life with his family, and even to pursue his dreams on the side by starting a band: Copa Kings. He cherishes the everyday moments with his family. The villagers think this year's crop will be bountiful. There is also good work in a growing city an hour away. But the locals are wise to a life of insecurity, and their thoughts are often of family members or opportunities far away, north of the border. While working in the fields, Pedro meets and begins to mentor a teenager who dreams of the US. That place somehow always feels very present, practically knocking at the door. \"Aquí y Allá\" is a story about hope, and the memories and loss of what we leave behind.","popularity":0.127,"poster_path":"/g6bamLPeMdbrvQdoY5t7QYRcCL8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2012-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Here and There","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":17,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Hier und dort","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro De los Santos","original_name":"Pedro De los Santos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a5dc3a368484e14f2a9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teresa Ramírez Aguirre","original_name":"Teresa Ramírez Aguirre","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a5dc3a368484e14f2ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorena Guadalupe Pantaleón Vázquez","original_name":"Lorena Guadalupe Pantaleón Vázquez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a5dc3a368484e14f2b1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154433,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heidi Laura Solano Espinoza","original_name":"Heidi Laura Solano Espinoza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a5dc3a368484e14f2b5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Néstor Tepetate Medina","original_name":"Néstor Tepetate Medina","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a5dc3a368484e14f2b9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolina Prado Ángel","original_name":"Carolina Prado Ángel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a5dc3a368484e14f2bd","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noel Payno Vendíz","original_name":"Noel Payno Vendíz","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a5dc3a368484e14f2c1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1154437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolás Parra Quiroz","original_name":"Nicolás Parra Quiroz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a5dc3a368484e14f2c5","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1073834,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Antonio Méndez Esparza","original_name":"Antonio Méndez Esparza","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a6f6e8f0e0a267962003299","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1874416","wikidata_id":"Q2859289","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qQeuMPJGtqY3cNbKAx6hJIoeCPq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/g6bamLPeMdbrvQdoY5t7QYRcCL8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
