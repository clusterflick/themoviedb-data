En route to Lucknow, they meet with Nawab Buland Akhtar Changezi, and subsequently meet with him a few days later so that he can use his influence to secure an editor's job for Anwar with a magazine. Nawab then asks Anwar to teach his sister, Husna, some poetry, to which he agrees, and eventually finds that she is the very same veiled woman. Both fall in love with each other and the Nawab approves of this alliance, even though Anwar lives a poor lifestyle. The formal engagement ceremony takes place and arrangements are made for the wedding to take place soon. The heavily indebted Nawab does not realize that soon he will find Anwar in the company of a lowly courtesan, Najma; and pressure will be brought on him to get Husna to marry wealthy Munne Raja - who is all set to auction the former's mansion as well as belongings.","popularity":0.4054,"poster_path":"/zMDSTLVbSkRaiI2FhL0npBMVeTv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26667,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rahul Theatres","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1963-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"Urdu","iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mere Mehboob","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rajendra Kumar","original_name":"Rajendra Kumar","popularity":0.4136,"profile_path":"/i7rOkTUcpsz7LbAj1M4aJXvx44g.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Anwar Hussain","credit_id":"582f9fd292514162cf0016e3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashok Kumar","original_name":"Ashok Kumar","popularity":0.4169,"profile_path":"/qgGxN6haBTelGteikmDrGFixadV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Nawab Buland Akhtar Changezi","credit_id":"5a85272c0e0a2653b3019fdf","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1066770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nimmi","original_name":"Nimmi","popularity":0.1116,"profile_path":"/tIcshVshHnaOS4allq7l7eavoWg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Suraiya / Najma","credit_id":"582f9fe092514162c90016ad","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1034087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ameeta","original_name":"अमीता","popularity":0.0999,"profile_path":"/woSs7MMjreCcBohUYfHfA1AUkvf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Naseem Ara, cousin of Husna and Buland Akhtar","credit_id":"5b4076239251414f610021b5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":639461,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mumtaz Begum","original_name":"Mumtaz Begum","popularity":0.1868,"profile_path":"/lbzmD4putTxLLaXfWiyh2HBCTAH.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Naseem's paternal aunt ('Bua')","credit_id":"5b407636c3a36840b800310b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110085,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pran Sikand","original_name":"Pran Sikand","popularity":0.3902,"profile_path":"/aTI9CC8ktetco0VKQGDtdSQBuuJ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Munne Raja","credit_id":"582f9ff892514162d2001722","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":629439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Walker","original_name":"Johnny Walker","popularity":0.0961,"profile_path":"/f69kcueOEADjkYW2aKhYfq8I8mn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Bindadin K.
