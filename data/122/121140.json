BOB AND THE MONSTER crafts contemporary footage, animation and compelling interviews with archival performances and personal videos from Bob's past to reveal the complex layers of this troubled, but hopeful soul. Testimony from his peers, including Courtney Love, Anthony Kiedis and Flea add texture, but it's the depth of Bob's music, interwoven throughout the film, that illuminates this unforgettable and inspirational story.","popularity":1.2323,"poster_path":"/veC3C57HnOOWKDOj7QiOY72iNj5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bob and the Monster","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1237,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flea","original_name":"Flea","popularity":0.5748,"profile_path":"/nGQE7xf4YJeqO0a4lpFebhwI7R9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a5bc3a368484e14eb77","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73956,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Frusciante","original_name":"John Frusciante","popularity":0.2854,"profile_path":"/tuia85HcQuzDUwk5f2zfk7odXIw.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a5bc3a368484e14eb7b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Kiedis","original_name":"Anthony Kiedis","popularity":0.3739,"profile_path":"/5tsTeYpixbIDtBljiFgPgWt9KQP.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a5bc3a368484e14eb7f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":552133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Pinsky","original_name":"Drew Pinsky","popularity":0.6803,"profile_path":"/zbZVcTYiUeV92vco6QRpkTt7Iqt.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a5bc3a368484e14eb87","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":975071,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Weiland","original_name":"Scott Weiland","popularity":0.2901,"profile_path":"/5hImKlqz0Yy3jdWOsnoL0mvny22.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4a5bc3a368484e14eb8b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Courtney Love","original_name":"Courtney Love","popularity":0.5244,"profile_path":"/lIb3gMM1LoE53mHYnMWooBH4mDJ.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"56c069a7c3a36817f400c208","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1441148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gibby Haynes","original_name":"Gibby Haynes","popularity":0.1543,"profile_path":"/rgaWpWUMugQE5oDD81f93diiWLb.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5bd38dd00e0a2622cc0095c6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1073761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Forrest","original_name":"Bob Forrest","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/vtPj2tgZSiYkS3sXDmUq6qrMUb7.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"6618448cdbf1440186857313","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":999272,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keirda Bahruth","original_name":"Keirda Bahruth","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a5bc3a368484e14eb69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":999272,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Keirda Bahruth","original_name":"Keirda Bahruth","popularity":0.0598,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a5bc3a368484e14eb6f","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1226276","wikidata_id":"Q4934513","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":873,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pKZt7o9HNWbw6t7q4iZ9EIsnbNh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1552}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.72,"height":2779,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/veC3C57HnOOWKDOj7QiOY72iNj5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Edmonton International Film Festival","release_date":"2011-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Red Rock Film Festival","release_date":"2011-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
