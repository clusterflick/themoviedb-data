In both cases, he made many acquaintances, came across as engaging and helpful but finally vanished with millions in cash. Interviews with people who encountered the man and were duped by him, though despite this and despite losing money, many of them retain a humorous feeling about what happened.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":"/2FQPDXCVxxBiekhMhyZafJVjJ7Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bedragaren","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1867620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"György Zemplényi","original_name":"György Zemplényi","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"598ce61b92514178fc000278","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1074498,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Åsa Blanck","original_name":"Åsa Blanck","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/o3pBks2V4vSPOUiW0pK8N5CBsG7.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a62c3a368484e15015b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074499,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan Palmgren","original_name":"Johan Palmgren","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":"/9CRR2Cga2ErkZdLTuXsrLj1Mcir.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4a62c3a368484e150161","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1386411","wikidata_id":"Q14955191","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zfGqlaZl0WXeLqEUPlBcIspOPvi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1687,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/2FQPDXCVxxBiekhMhyZafJVjJ7Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1181}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
