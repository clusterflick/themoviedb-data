George and Kathleen Lutz's story went on to inspire a best-selling novel and the subsequent films have continued to fascinate audiences today. This documentary reveals the horror behind growing up as part of a world-famous haunting and while Daniel's facts may be others' fiction, the psychological scars he carries are indisputable. Documentary filmmaker Eric Walter has combined years of independent research into the Amityville case along with the perspectives of past investigative reporters and eyewitnesses, giving way to the most personal testimony of the subject to date.","popularity":0.3206,"poster_path":"/sh7Hbs4PWFFTYOlMLXW3JZt0veK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16623,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lost Witness Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":16624,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Regions International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I just wanted somebody to believe me.","title":"My Amityville Horror","video":false,"vote_average":5.667,"vote_count":60,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"我的阴宅","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Lutz","original_name":"Daniel Lutz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a368484e151685","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203836,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Bartell","original_name":"Susan Bartell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a368484e15168f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203837,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura DiDio","original_name":"Laura DiDio","popularity":0.0595,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a368484e151693","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marvin Scott","original_name":"Marvin Scott","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a368484e151697","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1203592,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Matthew LaCurts","original_name":"Matthew LaCurts","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a368484e15168b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158484,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eric Walter","original_name":"Eric Walter","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a368484e15167b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1158484,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eric Walter","original_name":"Eric Walter","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a67c3a368484e151681","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1727523","wikidata_id":"Q77401079","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4lmC5ZJlvV8pRJrNRNCuGhMf0cy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.669,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sh7Hbs4PWFFTYOlMLXW3JZt0veK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1370},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1763,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/frpTobQeifmtv2emmUTU5U27wIz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1175}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Fantasia International Film Festival","release_date":"2012-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Austin Fantastic Fest","release_date":"2012-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"My Amityville Horror TRAILER 1 (2013) - Documentary HD","key":"iyZqxv0eWog","published_at":"2013-03-01T00:33:19.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6e9c3a3685448008d70"}]}}}
