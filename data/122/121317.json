Everything seems to be fine with the middle class Bendrick family with their two teenage children and a younger son, until the mother starts seeing her first love again after 20 years. Just like their badly built house, the family façade starts slowly crumbling into pieces. The daughter, 15, finds her first love, and the boys too are puzzled by their own questions around adolescence and sexuality. The father tries to keep up a happy face, while the youngest son is the first and the most sensitive to realize how the family is heading towards a disaster.","popularity":0.3614,"poster_path":"/LLYqILeye2cm5K1Gq7rQpnwj5f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157,"logo_path":"/s537keIoi6wUOU8E9ztWaV2DY1H.png","name":"SVT Drama","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2001-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Family Secrets","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Familiehemmeligheder","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rolf Lassgård","original_name":"Rolf Lassgård","popularity":0.5927,"profile_path":"/jwS0hdn9k4APVHabGzzqGJz6n6j.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bosse Bendricks","credit_id":"52fe4a61c3a368484e14ff97","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Lundqvist","original_name":"Maria Lundqvist","popularity":0.1536,"profile_path":"/qpuCubTutyXo3H33DOS86S8Xh1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mona Bendricks","credit_id":"52fe4a61c3a368484e14ff9b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Magnus Krepper","original_name":"Magnus Krepper","popularity":0.5203,"profile_path":"/xFN9sb8S2fjcUtbWvzTxoLH4QUJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kjell's Father","credit_id":"52fe4a61c3a368484e14ff9f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":57015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sissela Kyle","original_name":"Sissela Kyle","popularity":0.267,"profile_path":"/F07lZ9cuwrSiHjLYofOBtbHKHU.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gun","credit_id":"52fe4a61c3a368484e14ffa3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbro Kollberg","original_name":"Barbro Kollberg","popularity":0.1545,"profile_path":"/zVsPHDjDjAj1zizhBk5D6HDW7sC.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5ab9e4e7c3a36871d6010412","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6292,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbro Kollberg","original_name":"Barbro Kollberg","popularity":0.1545,"profile_path":"/zVsPHDjDjAj1zizhBk5D6HDW7sC.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Asta","credit_id":"5ab9e4f6c3a36871dd00dd29","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathias Henrikson","original_name":"Mathias Henrikson","popularity":0.1147,"profile_path":"/sAeovtdLgSNrO9dbZL9kw6IG5fU.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5ab9e50d9251414d3400ef66","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kjell-Åke Andersson","original_name":"Kjell-Åke Andersson","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a61c3a368484e14ff93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231315,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Håkan Lindhé","original_name":"Håkan Lindhé","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/7zoBXX5vIdLbUg2E8JS4eHNpVF5.jpg","credit_id":"5cffe06a0e0a262576cd9120","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83883,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kjell-Åke Andersson","original_name":"Kjell-Åke Andersson","popularity":0.1088,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cffe0729251411a82c137f0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1029065,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anna Carlsten","original_name":"Anna Carlsten","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f41a550c175b20036657dab","department":"Production","job":"Casting"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0268297","wikidata_id":"Q10493924","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vDuegSC5SbhoTgA9gSiBuE5Gtea.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/LLYqILeye2cm5K1Gq7rQpnwj5f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
