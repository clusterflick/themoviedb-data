This skillful vérité portrait follows the unassuming Khoshjamal in the nine months leading up to the 2008 Beijing games. Living in an Islamic country, she is required to wear a hijab at all times and, unlike her fellow competitors around the world, cannot train with men; however, the power in her fighting resoundingly breaks down stereotypical barriers.  Khoshjamal’s experience as a world-class athlete may be familiar, but captured here is the importance of the coach-athlete relationship. The bond she shares with her feisty and much-admired female coach is revealed through everyday moments as both struggle through inequality to make their mark—in sport and society. Though it’s still the male athletes who are ultimately celebrated in her country, Khoshjamal’s accomplishments and lasting influence on scores of girls in Iran are undeniable.","popularity":0.0511,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":9231,"logo_path":"/zPaoz8FDKRBvST1iOzsJHphCIC.png","name":"brave new work GmbH","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kick in Iran","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3215166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Khoshjamal-Fekri","original_name":"Sara Khoshjamal-Fekri","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Self","credit_id":"612a5b4781140f002ab2d095","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3215167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maryam Azarmehr","original_name":"Maryam Azarmehr","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Self","credit_id":"612a5b4d223e20002fd821ad","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3215168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teremeh Azarmehr","original_name":"Teremeh Azarmehr","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"612a5b541bf876006228da1d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1073884,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arash Setoodeh","original_name":"Arash Setoodeh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a5cc3a368484e14f015","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1073882,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Katja Hahn","original_name":"Katja Hahn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a5cc3a368484e14f009","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1073885,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mohammad Farokhmanesh","original_name":"Mohammad Farokhmanesh","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a5cc3a368484e14f01b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1073880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fatima Geza Abdollahyan","original_name":"Fatima Geza Abdollahyan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a5cc3a368484e14effd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1073880,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fatima Geza Abdollahyan","original_name":"Fatima Geza Abdollahyan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a5cc3a368484e14eff7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1073887,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Armin Hofmann","original_name":"Armin Hofmann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a5cc3a368484e14f027","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1073886,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Frank Geiger","original_name":"Frank Geiger","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4a5cc3a368484e14f021","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1073883,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Saam Schlamminger","original_name":"Saam Schlamminger","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612a5af574d6c0002ac4819a","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1073881,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jakobine Motz","original_name":"Jakobine Motz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"612a5aeaa1d3320094f2f953","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1562347","wikidata_id":"Q1740813","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sundance Film Festival","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"AFI Dallas International Film Festival","release_date":"2010-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"True/False Film Festival","release_date":"2010-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
