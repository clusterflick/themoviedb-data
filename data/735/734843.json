Today in her mid-nineties, she lives with her two daughters – Maya Krishna Rao, a contemporary solo theatre practitioner based in Delhi and Tara Rao, who works as human rights campaigner in Bengaluru. Bhanumathi, an elegant and witty woman, whose hearing and memory doesn’t usually stand up, has led an enigmatic, passionate, yet a simple and pragmatic life. Filming Bhanumathi in Delhi and Bengaluru, with her daughters nudging her, the filmmaker takes the audience on a journey of life and performance, through the spasms of memory, complexities of relationships, love and a reflection of what could constitute a beautiful mind.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/7N91qQX3Ad4wiPKgnrGu19NbZpS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"a film by R.
