This conversation, much like the last one, is full of some very thought provoking insights to the ever evolving business of professional wrestling as well as random and obscure questions.  Speaking of random, this video starts off with a discussion about Ron Reis which has never been the jumping off point for any video release ever. Rob, Chris and Dave converse over such topics as what elements make a great pro wrestling faction, which wrestlers who should have had better careers, and the growing accessibility of wrestling footage online.  Dave also gives a great explanation and justification behind reviews and the ratings system.  If you liked Volume 1 then you will not be disappointed with Volume 2 of Hitting the Highspots with Rob Naylor, Chris Hero & Dave Meltzer.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/rnTDi8tTCC7Joe1kQpTtl6fmgEm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitting The Highspots - Dave Meltzer Vol 2","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":890,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rnTDi8tTCC7Joe1kQpTtl6fmgEm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
