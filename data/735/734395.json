Surrounded and inspired by the ogliastra countryside, the cyclopic guardian of plots and landslides, Maria Lai uses inert materials like stone, concrete, asphalt, metal and wood to work old and new legends into librettos of individual works, installations and interventions, thus becoming part of the landscape that calls to her. In making this film the authors have confided in the artistâ€™s role as a spokeperson, and it is as if one is listening to the voice of a wild olive tree - both millenary and contemporary - a voice that knows what to say (and can say whatever it wants) from beyond the boundaries of reality, history, nature and art. As that tree, the artist - confident of her roots - with a sound sense of rhythm and scansion, multiplies big and small stories, just as she did with the bread and fish in Santa Barbara di Ulassai along the way to the country church.","popularity":0.3072,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2001-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inventata da un dio distratto","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2746884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Lai","original_name":"Maria Lai","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/jav30zxaPywgTgoqBaP378aw0nA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5f3c108bbb10570034f33cb7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1996957,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicoletta Nesler","original_name":"Nicoletta Nesler","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3c105460620a0035a8cbd4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1996958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marilisa Piga","original_name":"Marilisa Piga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3c1037982f74003563a20b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3675,"name":"arts and culture"},{"id":2679,"name":"artist"},{"id":3466,"name":"sardinia, italy"},{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Italiano\", \"english_name\"=>\"Italian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"it\", \"native_name\"=>\"Italiano\"}","note":"","release_date":"2001-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
