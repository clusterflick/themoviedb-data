The piece explores how a closed system functions, as well as the idea of presence within and modifications to it.  The action in the video revolves around the former building of some kind of closed institution, where the staff are immersed in the ritual of carrying out their duties. Their only objective is to ensure the stability of a system through their physical presence. Everything proceeds in the usual fashion, and only in the final scene is the possibility of any change to the established order hinted at.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/tJEKdeOoC5MebCKVLXgYqHgaZwC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shift","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Smena","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2364742,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Polina Kanis","original_name":"Polina Kanis","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3aa981a3b5e60034f58532","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1126,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tJEKdeOoC5MebCKVLXgYqHgaZwC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
