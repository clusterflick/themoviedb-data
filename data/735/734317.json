Trying to flirt with a young girl, Simon, the best friend of Lord Patschog specifies Lords character: a person estranged to his environment, unable to accept his own existence. The party ends suddenly when Lord passes through a mirror! We find him again at the other side of the mirror, a place where he is forced to face countless reflections of himself and to be the reflection of anyone who stands on the other side of the mirror. Soon his sister follows him.","popularity":0.062,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":138737,"logo_path":null,"name":"Savefrag","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
