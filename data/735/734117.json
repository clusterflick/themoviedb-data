The filmmakers lived in the hostel for more than two months, establishing an extraordinary level of trust with their “cast” —from the home’s feisty cook to an elderly resident who was a terminal alcoholic. In what will later be recognized as a signature style, Longinotto films without judgement and finds the humor and humanity in situations and characters that might otherwise be seen as tragic. This stunning film debut earned awards at several European festivals and screened to acclaim in the US and Asia.","popularity":0.37,"poster_path":"/10Olhm1usx80jaOgiKFbsdmgPJc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5846,"logo_path":"/h9O2O30eqiYaNi8qRKclV2U4Wjw.png","name":"Thames Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":136610,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Film & Television School","origin_country":""},{"id":24488,"logo_path":"/qR7gDm9nMYdrqnVpksmNMhwI1ZI.png","name":"Women Make Movies","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Theatre Girls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3017676,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claire Pollak","original_name":"Claire Pollak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6055f9a68c44b900546564dd","department":"Directing","job":"Co-Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1046935,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Longinotto","original_name":"Kim Longinotto","popularity":0.0678,"profile_path":"/u5tB6AkfkgZ3nk3EBtWPlp0WigN.jpg","credit_id":"5f3acba746aed4003761fe94","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9765154","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1281,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/10Olhm1usx80jaOgiKFbsdmgPJc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":855}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":17971,"name":"homeless shelter"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
