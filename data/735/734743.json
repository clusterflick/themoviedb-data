This interview is unlike any other interview in the Highspots.com collection, which is safe to say because this interview starts of with a discussion about Shinjiro Otani. From beginning to end this video is a wrestling nerdfest; so you better do your homework.  The topics of job guys, important wrestling events Dave witnessed personally, rip off tag teams, who did the \"inside out bump\" first, the importance of Manny Fernandez career and so many other questions that you didn't even know you wanted to know the answer until now.  The amazing part about this interview is this conversation would have happened the exact same way even if the cameras weren't recording it. So sit back and enjoy as Rob Naylor and Chris Hero are \"Hitting the Highspots\" with Dave Meltzer.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/gsq7e7PwaIU6CxBzb6NmmOOvJeU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitting The Highspots - Dave Meltzer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":890,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gsq7e7PwaIU6CxBzb6NmmOOvJeU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
