They are known as Baladehi and Paeindehi. The movie tells the story of their conflicts. The Paeindehis purchase a bus after selling a salt marsh near the sea, causing Baladehis who live their lives by riding chariots (ilinka), lose their job. Disputes resume and the teacher and Pirbaba (elder) of the village try to reconcile them, but the village chief who does not want to lose his profits, makes the Baladehis buy a bus as well.... The arrival of the bus to the village reveals the fact that the village chief has planned it all to acquire more and more wealth. Learning this, the two tribes forget their dispute to punish the chief, and afterwards, they all resume their normal lives.","popularity":0.0735,"poster_path":"/5VpkaP2aYeL72Q0NfqEWgzDrUdj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"1986-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2337976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hadi Eslami","original_name":"Hadi Eslami","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":"/bAgcYYts1e6d1Ook0burAK7VwoZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3d8ac39715ae0037df998d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1588578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Morteza Ahmadi","original_name":"Morteza Ahmadi","popularity":0.0857,"profile_path":"/vG44iZws2f7ithuwmCpI2ewGyqm.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3d8acc9590e3003572b00c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1174333,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hamid Taati","original_name":"Hamid Taati","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3d8ae39ae613003646804c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2337981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hossein Memarzade","original_name":"Hossein Memarzade","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3d8aed35a61e0035f8baff","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1316492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mehri Mehrinia","original_name":"Mehri Mehrinia","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":"/bFFnWEfzqqoOYHijIDWUjbdEPe7.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3d8af48805510037e72a14","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5225629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mahnaz Eslami","original_name":"Mahnaz Eslami","popularity":0.048,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"67a26a8b7ebb0614ff26c793","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2748070,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Morteza Rastegar","original_name":"Morteza Rastegar","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"626373a557530e0a742c0324","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1261536,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dariush Farhang","original_name":"داریوش فرهنگ","popularity":0.241,"profile_path":"/9Qc2oc7T2Z5krqK1VHpFzBfdRom.jpg","credit_id":"5f3d8a4b9715ae0035e0118b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":399947,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hossein Zandbaf","original_name":"Hossein Zandbaf","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/6F7DCH8GsNiWXTh8au5JmTuhG4I.jpg","credit_id":"5f3d8b15afe22400346b8451","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1591735,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yadollah Samadi","original_name":"Yadollah Samadi","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":"/dkBsmvsYwhnbsudFWqZbuIQrPN3.jpg","credit_id":"5f3d8a2d9715ae0037df991c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1806038,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Babak Bayat","original_name":"Babak Bayat","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/lec1h6zkUzYW3QqN3nKszeToAbX.jpg","credit_id":"5f3d8a5e8805510036e789a9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1416751,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mahmoud Dowlatabadi","original_name":"Mahmoud Dowlatabadi","popularity":0.1228,"profile_path":"/1N1u9TE6FMoOpoWtAqdWMlVVGg3.jpg","credit_id":"5f3d8a4235a61e0036fa2684","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0090781","wikidata_id":"Q14756521","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1685,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5VpkaP2aYeL72Q0NfqEWgzDrUdj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1123},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1726,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tZcblSXrmoSJM777xI4ZABuAgvx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1150}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Persian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Persian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fa\", \"native_name\"=>\"Persian\"}","note":"","release_date":"1986-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
