It’s terrific background material, especially the music disc with the favorite characters both human and muppet. Plus some of my nostalgic favorites — it helps if you once had a baby or toddler in your lap, clapping along with you for these things. I can’t think of a better way to honor the show, and am ready for a followup, with more favorite segments.","popularity":0.5712,"poster_path":"/ac5WA1N2MikJj8xIlb53LKQFWys.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":350,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sesame Street: 50 Years and Counting","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55983,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Henson","original_name":"Jim Henson","popularity":0.4689,"profile_path":"/93vzGW2kWwmAJ8HpbErzKMHXDME.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Ernie","credit_id":"5f3b9cb81c043500368d1dfb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Oz","original_name":"Frank Oz","popularity":1.6212,"profile_path":"/mb2JbT8s6LIgaxj6QTph0NW1pmI.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cookie Monster","credit_id":"5f3b9ccc29c626003685e2e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroll Spinney","original_name":"Caroll Spinney","popularity":0.2904,"profile_path":"/rYn1E9Um326MA1sWCEBlMCFkRGD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Big Bird","credit_id":"5f3b9cdd2495ab0031d17aa1","order":2}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12906102","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ac5WA1N2MikJj8xIlb53LKQFWys.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
