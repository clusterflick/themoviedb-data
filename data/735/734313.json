When a mysterious man passes her test, will she finally open her heart to love?  Puccini’s last opera Turandot, unfinished at his death, is musically his most adventurous work. Infused with Asian touches, it cannot deny its Italian heritage, culminating in the world-famous aria ‘Nessun dorma’. In 2017, the director duo Ricci/Forte were awarded the prestigious Italian Music Critics Award Franco Abbiati for best direction for their creative project.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ujrigk7j5Q9rbiPHcsqdCaGMCzC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turandot - Sferisterio Opera Festival in Macerata","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1562559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebeka Lokar","original_name":"Rebeka Lokar","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":"/sMwXFZP7fGDmtUXVYOVbZKKmuG6.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3ba7cf46aed40035690d14","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1680766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renzo Zulian","original_name":"Renzo Zulian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3ba7d61fb94f0033b092ed","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2180094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Fijačko Kobić","original_name":"Valentina Fijačko Kobić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3ba7de1c043500338bf941","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2746541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Berislav Puškarić","original_name":"Berislav Puškarić","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3ba7e529c6260035866b31","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2746542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Božimir Lovrić","original_name":"Božimir Lovrić","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3ba7eb66e46900344d131a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2746543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Davor Radić","original_name":"Davor Radić","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3ba7f2be4b360034b33f84","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2746544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Filipović","original_name":"Mario Filipović","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3ba7f91fb94f0036ad8091","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2746545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivo Gamulin","original_name":"Ivo Gamulin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3ba8002495ab0033d13871","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2746546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neven Paleček","original_name":"Neven Paleček","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5f3ba8081fb94f0033b094b5","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2746547,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marcello Mottadelli","original_name":"Marcello Mottadelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3ba82466e46900364e3f88","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1952893,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stefano Ricci","original_name":"Stefano Ricci","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3ba81a1fb94f0034aca6fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ujrigk7j5Q9rbiPHcsqdCaGMCzC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":666}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
