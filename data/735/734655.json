Through text, brief interviews, and images of the empty spaces of Port Townsend's former Chinatown, the film examines early instances of racism against the Chinese in the U.S., from the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 through various lynchings, beatings, and murders. The Chinese Gardens also documents Chinese American resistance to these crimes, illuminating the hidden history of that tumultuous time.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chinese Gardens","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valerie Soe","original_name":"Valerie Soe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3d8ee435a61e0035f8ca0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valerie Soe","original_name":"Valerie Soe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3d8faaafe22400356e6591","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2748073,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"John Kiffmeyer","original_name":"John Kiffmeyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3d8f9c9715ae0037df9f34","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638469,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Valerie Soe","original_name":"Valerie Soe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3d8efa9590e3003374a590","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2231565","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
