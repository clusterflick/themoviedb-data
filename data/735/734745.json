These two men met and became friends in FCW when it was the developmental for the WWE. Before any of that is discussed, Rob wants to talk about some of the highlights of Dr. Tom's career: his debut, working for Paul Boesch, going to Portland, turning heel in Mid South, the \"I Need to Talk to Tom\" angle and much more. These two also talk about some of the all time great tough guys in wrestling and how important they were for the business.  Like we mentioned earlier, there is plenty of discussion about the developmental system. Who were the can't miss prospects that slipped through their fingers? Who were the unsung heroes? What was the environment like when Dr. Tom was in charge of FCW? Of course, both men share their favorite stories about working with the late great Dusty Rhodes.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/uasQqW5Lat7O2pPOjJ2oVGg8OSu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitting The Highspots - Dr. Tom Prichard","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uasQqW5Lat7O2pPOjJ2oVGg8OSu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2016-02-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
