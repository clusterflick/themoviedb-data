Gloomy but not entirely devoid of comedy, it represents a rather amusing mixture of slapstick, early avantgarde, Švankmajer-esque animation and Leningrad Necrorealism. At the heart of it is the life story of a depersonalised hermit who has been thrown out of historical time and is stuck in a looped timelessness. This is the story of a solitary war, fought simultaneously in external and internal territories, while blurring the boundaries between them in the dreams and reveries of a madman.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/waS9K747YCEIppwscf68WzFUYQE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life Of Gorislav Chuzhdozemniy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Zhitiye Goreslava Chuzhdozemnogo","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2745369,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimir S.","original_name":"Vladimir S.","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3a9e01c5840d0034a0fe80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2745365,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ivan Shestov","original_name":"Ivan Shestov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3a9da9c5840d0032a49af8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2745372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greht","original_name":"Greht","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3a9e2fa3b5e60037ef71ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2745368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eugene E.","original_name":"Eugene E.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3a9ddec5840d0034a0fe3e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/waS9K747YCEIppwscf68WzFUYQE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":761}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
