The Bally Astrocade was unique among cartridge games in that it was designed to allow users to change game cartridges with power-on. When pressing the reset button, it was possible to remove the cartridge from the system and induce various memory dump pattern sequences. Digital TV Dinner is a collection of these curious states of silicon epilepsy set to music composed and generated upon this same platform.","popularity":0.2077,"poster_path":"/mmZaroB2XMxOjLvpRJIo2pWUn3W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Digital TV Dinner","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275327,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dick Ainsworth","original_name":"Dick Ainsworth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616d8bbea097dc002a905c44","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3275328,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raul Zaritsky","original_name":"Raul Zaritsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616d8bd2ba131b00614fc73d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2746613,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jamie Faye Fenton","original_name":"Jamie Faye Fenton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3bc51746aed400346d0013","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mmZaroB2XMxOjLvpRJIo2pWUn3W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":852}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10159,"name":"computer animation"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"},{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
