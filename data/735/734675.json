The virtual journey takes the viewer to various African, European and Asian countries, in order to find the place where it was originally created, produced and sold. What seems easy in the beginning turns out to be a demanding process, yet an interesting experience in accessing information, communicating with people from totally different backgrounds and indulging in uncertainty, to celebrate the search itself — wherever it may lead. The film shows how boundaries between originality and reproduction merge, in a world where everything can be remixed and reprinted easily. Searching for the Perfect Gentleman tells a multi-layered story about trust, persistence and interconnectedness in a globalized world.","popularity":0.0362,"poster_path":"/lcmGponzEoShh2aTPH8Xa7TDTOQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Searching for the Perfect Gentleman","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2748117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lena Windisch","original_name":"Lena Windisch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself (voice)","credit_id":"5f3f603d904f6d0036a397ee","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2748117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lena Windisch","original_name":"Lena Windisch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3da407e295b40034a10825","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lcmGponzEoShh2aTPH8Xa7TDTOQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bcqxLCA6vHRHYh9TESFuqAvMkaO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1422}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":170487,"name":"essay film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Besides the Screen","release_date":"2020-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow International Documentary Film Festival DOKer","release_date":"2020-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
