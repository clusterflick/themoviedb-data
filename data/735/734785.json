The artist subverts the tradition of studio painting by using a computer to make simple line drawings. Later, the computer is transformed into a canvas through the regressive act of directly marking the monitor. Painting is related to scatology as a correlation is made between art making and infantile fantasy.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":"/7JsMiwR74kplSR2nebBYB4auc1g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whoa Whoa Studio (for Courbet)","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1667245,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cheryl Donegan","original_name":"Cheryl Donegan","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/ooo1r68pk6I8f400juj6KAEr48n.jpg","credit_id":"5f3e2a9bfdc146003452e258","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1395,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7JsMiwR74kplSR2nebBYB4auc1g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":930}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
