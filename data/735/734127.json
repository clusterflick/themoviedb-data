Lermontov's 19th century novel leaves a vapor trail on the action, but A Hero of Our Time is more precisely a portrait of contemporary Los Angeles, a tale of wayward heroism played out against a landscape of yearning and desolation. Director/writer Michael Almereyda, whose screenplay for Wim Wenders' Until the End of the World will be produced this year, completed principal photography for A Hero of Our Time in October of 1985. Dennis Hopper's participation occurred during a break in the filming of Blue Velvet.","popularity":0.5565,"poster_path":"/c0H3SdmsE5Z0FinNmcI2tUaMHBS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A
