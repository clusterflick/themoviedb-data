Born with an intellectual difference, Stéphane and Audrey want to prove to the world that they too can win medals. For three intense years marked by training and competitions, we follow them until the end of their ambitious dream, that of competing at the Special Olympics World Games in Dubai. Intertwining both sports odyssey and human portrait, this feel-good documentary offers an immersion into a fascinating world where athletes with an intellectual difference are at the forefront.","popularity":0.3418,"poster_path":"/1g4AAnwdreJIlwIYfoDYhTHhEEH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145532,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Vues de
