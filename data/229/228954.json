He is determined to run things his way.  One night in peaceful Seattle, a Tong gambling parlor is wiped out in a bloody massacre. Two men are caught; only Joe Wong (Daniel Hung Tang) - an innocent accomplice - manages to escape. Realizing that the others are brutal murderers, Joe becomes a man on the run - from the cops, from the FBI, and from the Tong's deadly hit squad. He meets Vinny (Hwee Ling Lee), an enslaved prostitute. Desperate and trapped, they escape together, hunted by Walker, the cop who won't quit until he tracks them down.  But there's no way out for the two lovers. In an act of passion, Vinny takes the bullet meant for Joe. Joe has only one choice left - to face the relentless Walker. Both men know that when they meet again, only one will walk away.","popularity":0.2988,"poster_path":"/kx37N9CIa5hOdWwpHFqk3JkbhY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Border of Tong","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Massacre","type":"Alternate"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Heavener","original_name":"David Heavener","popularity":0.1275,"profile_path":"/mYDvhyXR3HJ5fAhEZ3vI5wzo4Wf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Randy Walker","credit_id":"52fe4edd9251416c7516512b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Hung Tang","original_name":"Daniel Hung Tang","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Joseph Wong","credit_id":"52fe4ede9251416c7516512f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3908533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janessa Fitzgerald","original_name":"Janessa Fitzgerald","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63e12b5acd20460085b41302","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Chu","original_name":"Michael Chu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ede9251416c75165135","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0101498","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/z5r4iyEhRZuOBRKN719zy7fLO8a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/kx37N9CIa5hOdWwpHFqk3JkbhY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/njHsGUfmmvG63g10lwkYNWvD8ss.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bP2F7DY7tEtxzgZ5tPk3OKdkXtd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5964,"name":"chinese mafia"},{"id":212756,"name":"tongs"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
