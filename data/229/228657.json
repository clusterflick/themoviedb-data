The father, in an excess of parental concern, separates the lovers by sending his daughter away so that she might forget her lover, unaware of their married state. During this time, she gives birth to a daughter. After some months, the young mother returns to her family manor and presents her father with his new granddaughter, which causes a most unfortunate scene. Unbeknownst to the young woman, her enraged father falsely accuses his son-in-law of theft and has him incarcerated in order to separate the lovers in an irrational attempt to force his daughter to forget this \"unworthy\" young man.","popularity":0.2013,"poster_path":"/1551fxdHqi9ydb92yGE8yluFls0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Family Secret","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1095430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Baby Peggy","original_name":"Baby Peggy","popularity":0.149,"profile_path":"/ovc6OvG6d9zGfM3fRfaWc4OJWyk.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Peggy Holmes","credit_id":"52fe4ed39251416c75163bdf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1120784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gladys Hulette","original_name":"Gladys Hulette","popularity":0.0789,"profile_path":"/uvsTd2w1s52CRePbptkMzBBNsm3.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Margaret Selfridge","credit_id":"52fe4ed39251416c75163be3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Currier","original_name":"Frank Currier","popularity":0.1276,"profile_path":"/1j34PFDp9rAMPtospPYrR9CHY0.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Simon Selfridge","credit_id":"52fe4ed39251416c75163be7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Beaumont","original_name":"Lucy Beaumont","popularity":0.1869,"profile_path":"/2q6yQKr0aKkWJtIwO38pZxSsI9t.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Miss Abigail Selfridge","credit_id":"52fe4ed39251416c75163beb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34508,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Earle","original_name":"Edward Earle","popularity":0.3087,"profile_path":"/mybd58aGD8RYdfjObAcbdgx4og2.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Garry Holmes","credit_id":"52fe4ed39251416c75163bef","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Mackey","original_name":"Elizabeth Mackey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Aunt Mandy","credit_id":"52fe4ed39251416c75163bf7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":589729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha Mattox","original_name":"Martha Mattox","popularity":0.1855,"profile_path":"/42D4sj76ZMCrWAiPMmU3PWUvCjc.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Nurse Sneed","credit_id":"52fe4ed39251416c75163bfb","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cesare Gravina","original_name":"Cesare Gravina","popularity":0.1748,"profile_path":"/dwrv8VttqLIDlp7M5P6fUftRdhd.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Tomaso Silvano","credit_id":"52fe4ed39251416c75163bff","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1097174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Turner","original_name":"Martin Turner","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Uncle Mose","credit_id":"54c4bfb79251416185002ee1","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108987,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William A.
