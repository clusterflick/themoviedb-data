He blows smoke rings which do little tricks. He looks at the audience and taps the ash off his cigar. The telephone rings and makes Jerry jump - he looks cross. We see Jerry and the person he is speaking to in little circular cut-outs placed on another image of a landscape with telegraph poles stretching off into the distance. The man Jerry is speaking to is wearing a dressing gown and a funny little hat - possibly Scottish. The man says: \"I want you to paper the parlour.\" Jerry nods and replies: \"I'll be on the job in ten minutes!\" Jerry attempts to put a wallpaper table together. Slapstick stuff ensues. It keeps collapsing.","popularity":0.0634,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Jerry Papered the Parlour","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Bilby","original_name":"Bert Bilby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ed89251416c751644df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sid Griffiths","original_name":"Sid Griffiths","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ed89251416c751644d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1926-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
