When the home’s owner returns he drags the package inside, then goes about doing a few more activities before deciding to finally open it. Upon removing the paper, he notices it’s a large steel barrel. Using a blowtorch, he gets the lid off and sees it’s full of oily water… but rising out of the water is a nude, voluptuous, smiling woman, who immediately starts to entice the man by massaging her breasts. Naturally, being in a barrel for who knows how long, she needs to get cleaned off and hops into a bubble bath. While she’s lounging in the tub, the man gets into bed, lights a cigarette and starts to remove him clothes in anticipation. We get to see fantasies from both the man and “the fairy.” —The Bloody Pit of Horror","popularity":0.175,"poster_path":"/pwn2t7znzukdSEmzMooZ0emF5B7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bloodthirsty Fairy","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1365916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"To Katinaki","original_name":"To Katinaki","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"598e3275c3a36838e9001a73","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1520913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Lampe","original_name":"Pierre Lampe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"598e327c9251413833001eb3","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":102047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Bouyxou","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Bouyxou","popularity":1.105,"profile_path":"/ur6lJWnLPSdLxG31sXLIuVuSW7l.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"598e3284925141383c001e3b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Raphaël Marongiu","original_name":"Raphaël Marongiu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"598e328b9251413833001eca","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1868026,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Louise Duparc","original_name":"Marie-Louise Duparc","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"598e3292c3a3683969001bea","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":104225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jio Berk","original_name":"Jio Berk","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"598e3299c3a36838d2001d9e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1868027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chérie Peace","original_name":"Chérie Peace","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"598e32a09251413833001ee6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1868028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spirou Adamopoulos","original_name":"Spirou Adamopoulos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"598e32a89251413800001f29","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263167,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland Lethem","original_name":"Roland Lethem","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/1JpCtomjsI8wr9twqYYm5ccZi5p.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ed19251416c751637f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263167,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roland Lethem","original_name":"Roland Lethem","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":"/1JpCtomjsI8wr9twqYYm5ccZi5p.jpg","credit_id":"59a97b6fc3a3683c4d02c854","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1880529,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Julien Parent","original_name":"Julien Parent","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59a97b7ac3a3683ccc03074d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0197503","wikidata_id":"Q61978411","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w7rlMpnBvRIwcFDe5F8ysg59bhv.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1487,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pwn2t7znzukdSEmzMooZ0emF5B7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":991},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eIf2UE9C7mD222SeBVPZEhdBAoF.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
