In the Third Reich, however, the Führer and his Nazi bigwigs were laughed at. The political jokes of the Hitler years were a barometer of true public opinion. But those who dared to make jokes critical of the regime lived dangerously. In the early Nazi era, Hitler jokes were punished as \"insidious\", during the war even as \"undermining of military strength\" and the penalty was the death penalty! The conflict with the Nazi authorities ended more mildly for other pranksters: the cheeky cabaret artist Werner Finck was deported to a concentration camp, but was released again.","popularity":0.3477,"poster_path":"/bEWWRlILbaFzXLtI1ktmLJvZVIn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":249326,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brümmer & Herzog Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":89793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ilona Grundmann Filmproduction","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laughing With Hitler","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Heil Hitler, das Schwein ist tot Humor unterm Hakenkreuz","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5230,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hubertus Bengsch","original_name":"Hubertus Bengsch","popularity":0.4379,"profile_path":"/55DYLHScj5ODnmXWYWyaUZakxdT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (German)","credit_id":"52fe4ece9251416c75162f73","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arne Elsholtz","original_name":"Arne Elsholtz","popularity":0.0904,"profile_path":"/812GJMDwHW9ScBb1jQpnboUhckq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (English)","credit_id":"52fe4ece9251416c75162f77","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1052284,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Volker Michalowski","original_name":"Volker Michalowski","popularity":0.1841,"profile_path":"/v6Q6U2Y74fPnJspnIymzI6EgeIq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hitler","credit_id":"52fe4ece9251416c75162f7b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":568713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Stiglmeier","original_name":"Klaus Stiglmeier","popularity":0.0831,"profile_path":"/yUPWi1oNE0Bd4VONw5fm6D7n6zo.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Göring","credit_id":"52fe4ece9251416c75162f7f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":144215,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rudolph Herzog","original_name":"Rudolph Herzog","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ece9251416c75162f85","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3399102,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oliver Engelhardt","original_name":"Oliver Engelhardt","popularity":0.0996,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330e9ab40d0fe007a7dc03f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27619,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Henning Brümmer","original_name":"Henning Brümmer","popularity":0.0503,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330e9b1d38b58007bfc2a9d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0826734","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2590,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bEWWRlILbaFzXLtI1ktmLJvZVIn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1727}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
