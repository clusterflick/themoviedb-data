A cartoon curtain rises. A U.I.C. production. M/S of Sid Griffiths reading a newspaper. He folds it up and looks at his drawing board. He sees Jerry walking along with a bag of golf clubs on his back. \"Hello Jerry, where are you going?\" asks Sid. Jerry walks along and says \"Golfing!\" Sid sits back in his chair and says: \"Off to the links, eh?\" Jerry says: \"I've got my own.\" Sid scratches his head. \"Own what?\" \"Links!\" Jerry holds out a cufflink. It has the initials AO and FB on either side. Sid scratches his chin. Dissolve into some sheet music. It is the song \"The More We Are Together\" and is the official song of the Ancient Order of Froth Blowers. (Presumably this is what AO and FB stands for). Dissolve back into shot of Sid at the drawing board. He wags a finger at Jerry. \"Beware of the 19th hole!\" Jerry looks puzzled. He puts his cufflink in his pocket.","popularity":0.086,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Golf","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sid Griffiths","original_name":"Sid Griffiths","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ed89251416c7516458d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Bilby","original_name":"Bert Bilby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ed89251416c75164587","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0336519","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1926-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
