He then swims around with just a snorkel sticking out of the water. He emerges and submerges then sticks his upper body out of the sea and blows a jet of water out of his mouth. He swims along doing the front crawl. He looks very alarmed to see a whale swimming by him. His ears elongate. He screams and waves his arms in the air. Suddenly he is lifted out of the water by the whale - Jerry stands on his back.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jerry's Treasure Island Travel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1263303,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bert Bilby","original_name":"Bert Bilby","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ed79251416c7516430d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70711,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sid Griffiths","original_name":"Sid Griffiths","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ed79251416c75164313","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1926-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
