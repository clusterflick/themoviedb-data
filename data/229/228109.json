Your teenage years are never easy… but for Maude, things couldn't be worse. Within one week, she is suspended from school, stranded by her best friend, dumped by the boy she loved and inherits an enormous amount of money with the passing of her grandmother– only to be claimed under one condition: Maude must prove by age 18 that she knows exactly what to do with her life. But with her 18th birthday rapidly approaching, Maude must dive into a world of self-discovery or else lose the inheritance.","popularity":1.6028,"poster_path":"/w4AgnH9ZzpYFuNiNHEleoaxOyB8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17380,"logo_path":null,"name":"EBF Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two-Bit Waltz","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":20,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":962547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Mamet","original_name":"Clara Mamet","popularity":0.4721,"profile_path":"/zHvd8tIFjMpx3jkZHCZc7VSL8qx.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Maude","credit_id":"52fe4ebf9251416c75161043","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William H.
