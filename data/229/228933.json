Their first day at work is awkward but polite, with Jack all too aware of Sue’s privileged status as daughter of a well-respected general. This, however, will be no ordinary mission: as they train their sights on an unarmed terrorist suspect, a power struggle erupts between the smart, sophisticated Sue and the dogged, blue-collar Jack.","popularity":2.1391,"poster_path":"/cpCb1VdxYyo98b0eWfgHEi3qMUX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44727,"logo_path":null,"name":"Khaos
