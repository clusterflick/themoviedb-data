In this film a group of people are heading out West to Hollywood so they pack up their \"wagons\" and head out where they must battle various elements including crossing a dangerous river and battling Indians. The \"wagons\" are actually cars with a cover on them and the Indians even ride in on bicycles so you can tell the type of humor that Roach is going for.","popularity":0.411,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1923-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Uncovered Wagon","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Parrott","original_name":"James Parrott","popularity":0.3597,"profile_path":"/od32ZGilfKocacyL4EBKdcqkaL4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Bill Bunion","credit_id":"52fe4ebd9251416c75160c07","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1041512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katherine Grant","original_name":"Katherine Grant","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":"/iVWXfb8B1gYrspOuQIaiaMEo5iD.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mollie","credit_id":"52fe4ebd9251416c75160c0b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":88958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noah Young","original_name":"Noah Young","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/g6JErSrooY8JZgUkADkFiBNGXiP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ebd9251416c75160c0f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1041514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Rowe","original_name":"George Rowe","popularity":0.1696,"profile_path":"/gwjUURxylsA0D02s9NYXi3zTUvs.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ebd9251416c75160c13","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Jones","original_name":"Mark Jones","popularity":0.2299,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ebd9251416c75160c17","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1472314,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wally Howe","original_name":"Wally Howe","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/dCRkE4f9senVlBcCSGLT1Eubqcq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ebd9251416c75160c1b","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.A.
