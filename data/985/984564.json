She requests his help in escaping from an evil witch who has entrapped her on the glass mountain. He sets out to find the mountain and is helped on his way by a rather pathetic old giant and a magic butterfly who lends him a pair of wings. Finally, he arrives at his destination and the witch sets him to work on three impossible tasks...  The Drummer was one of the winning entries in 'The Magic Mirror' competition to find new animators for children's stories. The main condition was that the stories had to be adapted from existing fairy or folk tales. The series was sponsored by Kelloggs and the series producer was Anne Wood of Ragdoll Productions.  Shown on ITV, world wide TV, video and at international animation festivals.","popularity":0.0389,"poster_path":"/ypkwPJsRXEqiFt3s1m13DpSriu0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99433,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pearly Oyster Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":61833,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kellogg Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Drummer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1956453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ged Haney","original_name":"Ged Haney","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629dc20765e0a2550a298908","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1956453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ged Haney","original_name":"Ged Haney","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629dc232d2147c117e5e68d7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1956453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ged Haney","original_name":"Ged Haney","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629dc2107d5db5086be9101e","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1867867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Calder","original_name":"Emma Calder","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629dc1e2f3e0df009d6ef256","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1867867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emma Calder","original_name":"Emma Calder","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629dc1f0e4c9eb009bc0ed17","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1956453,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ged Haney","original_name":"Ged Haney","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629dc21de4c9eb0066f31db6","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ypkwPJsRXEqiFt3s1m13DpSriu0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10121,"name":"stop motion"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
