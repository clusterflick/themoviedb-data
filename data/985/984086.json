Documenting the activism of three decades amidst the intense sexual politics of radical feminism and social change, ‘memory film’ tells the inner story of a journey of liberation – gender fluidity, utopian feminism, love and its tribulations, the pleasure and pain of motherhood, violence against women, the desire for a world free of war and colonizing, and ultimately mortality and impermanence.","popularity":0.1113,"poster_path":"/eFV1WNyNxrgdXdN86oHhfEm5ZGU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92036,"logo_path":"/yzevqr6GX0Y2hJT2rXsQhuJgNYH.png","name":"Documentary Australia Foundation","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":147226,"logo_path":"/2vo7KiWQ6y04UJSoa8iMfvDX6ry.png","name":"National Film and Sound Archive of Australia (NFSA)","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":176568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anandi Films","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":153487,"logo_path":"/lLUhhdFmhLVKWdBpRe3Nwaa2U6h.png","name":"University of Technology Sydney","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2023-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An immersive, poetic diary film about transformation and ‘the personal is political’.","title":"Memory Film: A Filmmaker's Diary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"memory film","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeni Thornley","original_name":"Jeni Thornley","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/41o3we0RWKdz4lyYHSWWutNUeaf.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"629c5ec20929f600990183ac","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Megan McMurchy","original_name":"Megan McMurchy","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629c5d63f10a1a14342622a0","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1817901,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lindi Harrison","original_name":"Lindi Harrison","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629c5d0f65e0a255086a20ce","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1583921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeni Thornley","original_name":"Jeni Thornley","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":"/41o3we0RWKdz4lyYHSWWutNUeaf.jpg","credit_id":"629c5d207e12f00f22a8af62","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1348366,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Zubrycki","original_name":"Tom Zubrycki","popularity":0.07,"profile_path":"/nPPW0pRmG7ryvsTW7Hsu324UiqE.jpg","credit_id":"629c5d4765e0a255086a2112","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3576741,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Toula Anastas","original_name":"Toula Anastas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629c5d857d5db5086be3e8da","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Advisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":930078,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marcus Eckermann","original_name":"Marcus Eckermann","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629c5e6665e0a2550a24314f","department":"Crew","job":"Technical Advisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28452251","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1599,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eFV1WNyNxrgdXdN86oHhfEm5ZGU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Melbourne International Film Festival","release_date":"2023-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"‘memory film: a filmmaker's diary’ (Trailer)","key":"505107727","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-01-27T06:54:57.000Z","id":"629c5cd465e0a255097a57ac"}]}}}
