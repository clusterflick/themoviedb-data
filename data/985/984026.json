These are based on the history of the town which was founded on the banks of the river Oshun. This river itself is one of the most important river deities of the Yoruba whose cults spread even as far as Brazil. Aduni Susanne Wenger, a chief priestess of the Obatala cult, is shown rebuilding the once neglected Oshun shrine, with her fellow artists, Adebisi Akanji, OyeWale and Lani. The Beiers show how art based on traditional pagan religion forms the foundation of the modern movement.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9TdYTK3mXzBfoKopIDRxTMByrFo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Images","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3507167,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frank Speed","original_name":"Frank Speed","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629c133dcaa508009fcc52da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3576516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ulli Beier","original_name":"Ulli Beier","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629c13343faba00050a1e2f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9TdYTK3mXzBfoKopIDRxTMByrFo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
