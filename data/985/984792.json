Garrardâ€™s maintenance job on the building site allowed him to move about easily with his camera concealed behind his apron - into which he had cut a hole. This ingenious shooting style results in images combining imaginative angles with a not infrequent lack of focus.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":176684,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film and Photograph League","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1935-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Construction","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3578803,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alf Garrard","original_name":"Alf Garrard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629e4fdc1e9225009cf78ef7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1935-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
