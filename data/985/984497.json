Becoming unhoused with an infant inspired her to champion childcare and preschool as a human right. Funny and irreverent, Clarissa's infectious energy pulls us along as she presses forward, with fortitude gained through effort and loss. But juggling this work with raising a young son pushes Clarissa into a personal healthcare crisis far too common among stressed, working mothers, especially women of color. Clarissa's Battle follows her journey as a community leader, political candidate and time-stretched mother as she fights for the health and dignity of children and their parents nationwide. This isn't just Clarissa's battle - it's our battle, too.","popularity":0.5187,"poster_path":"/hw8FpBHubCAFrtLaz5gTJ3gqyYX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clarissa's Battle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4961280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clarissa Doutherd","original_name":"Clarissa Doutherd","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66f32b7d18f8ad4cf37e671c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3063362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patty Murray","original_name":"Patty Murray","popularity":0.0604,"profile_path":"/tlq4rDoU4TkMsikQIdMjekx8AZ2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66f32b9d3efb8ea1e5c77359","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3577988,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"C.B.
