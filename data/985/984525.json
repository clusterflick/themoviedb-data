One man, two women. Three lives in seclusion, but not lacking in passion. The man collects firewood by the side of the tracks of a now defunct train, while in his free time he enjoys the company of a little lamb. A woman who is fond of cave paintings displays the whole arsenal of data and notes from a life of fascination. The other - filmmaker Narcisa Hirsch - takes long walks in the woods while reflecting on decades of artistic practices and philosophical readings.","popularity":0.0661,"poster_path":"/4CaDudE06HcOfWquzQphFKDQ1Js.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2014-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La ciudadela","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2081534,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rubén Guzmán","original_name":"Rubén Guzmán","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629da139a284eb009df8b7e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4239084","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4CaDudE06HcOfWquzQphFKDQ1Js.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"su","note":"","release_date":"2014-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
