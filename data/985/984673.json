Waiting for a train to an unknown destination are two couples: one lesbian, one straight. As they move through the public and semi-public spaces of the train station - lobbies, stairwells, bathroom stalls - the couples and individuals exchange a series of glances (some overt, some furtive) that implicate one another in a web of desire, power, fear, homophobia, and heterosexism.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/jYeJXeDnI1PsKXnwcJ85GRIK3GI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strait","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3041330,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evie Leder","original_name":"Evie Leder","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629e20ee5507e932261a91ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jYeJXeDnI1PsKXnwcJ85GRIK3GI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
