There, he finds and rides ridiculous lines and creates films that terrify and/or inspire the rest of us.  Last year, COVID broke that tradition.  However, fortunately for Travis, thereâ€™s plenty of backcountry right in his backyard in Jackson Hole. All of the sudden, he saw an opportunity to reset and reconnect with his old stomping grounds.  Epic snow. Incredible terrain. Fresh air and beautiful solitude. Sometimes, Alaska comes to you.","popularity":0.4054,"poster_path":"/tr9jateXuLXIBC2lYM1RIkuaXEi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98206,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quiksilver","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TRAVIS RICE || RESETTER","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81948,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Travis Rice","original_name":"Travis Rice","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":"/hyyfP9RbVN3v2CvKtqOJ5e6sUOP.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rider","credit_id":"629bf4c1f10a1a009a1d3d83","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fBpxY9fZEuMfIs7wK7ar3dD0Gnr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tr9jateXuLXIBC2lYM1RIkuaXEi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3522,"name":"snowboarding"},{"id":183493,"name":"snowboard"},{"id":186823,"name":"backcountry"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"TRAVIS RICE || RESETTER","key":"cHSjInARd_0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2020-12-17T17:00:09.000Z","id":"629bf550caa5080067f60ee6"}]}}}
