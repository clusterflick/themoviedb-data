In addition to getting in trouble with the law, the Whites, who live deep within Appalachia, uphold a time-honored dancing style, even as they contend with poverty, drugs and other issues. Alternately humorous and sad, the movie is an unflinching look at life on the criminal margins of rural mountain culture.","popularity":0.9209,"poster_path":"/7EQQsuK1Hk1zcoBlNBKfU41aS39.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6328,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dickhouse Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":65210,"logo_path":"/72QPukfmt6dGT7NS028S2Ji9TjE.png","name":"MTV Production Development","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia","video":false,"vote_average":6.71,"vote_count":69,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesco White","original_name":"Jesco White","popularity":0.1887,"profile_path":"/3OFzEf6RW8Mia2UZIrhLpgSYpsn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe479fc3a36847f813fb85","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142598,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Nitzberg","original_name":"Julien Nitzberg","popularity":0.0664,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe479fc3a36847f813fb75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Knoxville","original_name":"Johnny Knoxville","popularity":1.2737,"profile_path":"/m7pkqxOSdIojhcLwVmlww2nwJCl.jpg","credit_id":"52fe479fc3a36847f813fb7b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Tremaine","original_name":"Jeff Tremaine","popularity":0.2346,"profile_path":"/3R8FemTgvyY1vLn9r0lYlL45P3Q.jpg","credit_id":"52fe479fc3a36847f813fb81","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":142599,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katie Doering","original_name":"Katie Doering","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe479fc3a36847f813fb8b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":142600,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Storm Taylor","original_name":"Storm Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe479fc3a36847f813fb91","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1396227","wikidata_id":"Q7774922","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2S0Kk3cMPE2CX0vEJ6Fp5OjPZgI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rPFyxrGlIPqS6H7DiXott4hymOR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7EQQsuK1Hk1zcoBlNBKfU41aS39.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zPSZm6V9m7ecTRAF6ke64XoXDJ7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ioAnXpIRXztq6duviz0fazkqPd2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uDl6SZmHb7L4RkW6s4y69dqw2Gp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":246,"name":"dancing"},{"id":8232,"name":"west virginia"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia (2009) Official Trailer #1 - Documentary Movie HD","key":"AQBiXDNVeSA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2013-02-12T06:46:36.000Z","id":"5f6a9860a0b6900037480eab"}]}}}
