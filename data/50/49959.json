They're to play in Paris at Charles's school reunion. In getting to Paris and back, the characters interact with Aimee's ex-husband and her abrasive, cruel ex-mentor, Louise's would-be lover who turns out to have a husband, Mickey's long-time lover and her children, Bertrand's Germanic wife and their children who speak no French, and Frederic's distant mother. The band also meets Clara, a mercurial free spirit who beguiles Bertrand, then Mickey, then takes up with someone else in the band.","popularity":0.5394,"poster_path":"/8bRvkKrodvTemCzHYHv6Qehuo6j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28766,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions Marcel
