The film is in two completely separate parts, and the directors of these respective sections, left-wing Pier Paolo Pasolini and conservative Giovanni Guareschi, offer the viewer contrasting analyses of and prescriptions for modern society. Part I, by Pasolini, is a denunciation of the offenses of Western culture, particularly those against colonized Africa. It is at the same time a chronicle of the liberation and independence of the former African colonies, portraying these peoples as the new protagonists of the world stage, holding up Marxism as their \"salvation\", and suggesting that their \"innocent ferocity\" will be the new religion of the era. Guareschi's part, by contrast, constitutes a defense of Western civilization and a word of hope, couched in traditional Christian terms, for man's future.","popularity":0.8922,"poster_path":"/thP95HJ5eOx0HrZ5jXhDUpqLaA5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opus Films","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1963-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Rabbia","video":false,"vote_average":7.115,"vote_count":26,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39466,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Giorgio Bassani","original_name":"Giorgio Bassani","popularity":0.1606,"profile_path":"/iUB7OsYvjB0McPugamUuzRNHvDB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Poetry Narrator - Part One (voice)","credit_id":"5ebb4824aad9c2001f230509","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1076487,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Renato Guttuso","original_name":"Renato Guttuso","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/d3fcQaDHjfqBdoMQypjt6qtFlFA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Prose Narrator - Part One (voice)","credit_id":"5ebb48310cb3350021d10b8a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2636478,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gigi Artuso","original_name":"Gigi Artuso","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator - Part Two (voice)","credit_id":"5ebb4846aad9c2002122d21b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlo Romano","original_name":"Carlo Romano","popularity":0.1975,"profile_path":"/tJRnl3NmlZrkkmrl0wB2vWUhLwW.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator - Part Two (voice)","credit_id":"5ebb484f614c6d001d8e6dde","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1141815,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles de Gaulle","original_name":"Charles de Gaulle","popularity":0.1933,"profile_path":"/dvJ2c6x0KoWEGLDZFGxls5pqrwS.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5ebb4856614c6d001c8e22f0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120575,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dwight D.
