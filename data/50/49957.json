Enduring hardships from everyday life on the streets of Vancouver, this sub-culture depicts street life as much more than stereotypes portrayed in mainstream media. The films takes a deep look into the lives of the men who race carts, the adversity they face, and the appeal of cart racing despite the risk.","popularity":0.7257,"poster_path":"/7GcWrslIotd6knpgd4nQSVDNrhC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It feels like freedom","title":"Carts of Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Les Chariots de l'Enfer","type":"French title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Murray Siple","original_name":"Murray Siple","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6020e50f5690b5004121709d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143101,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tracey Friesen","original_name":"Tracey Friesen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47b2c3a36847f81434ad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Murray Siple","original_name":"Murray Siple","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe47b2c3a36847f81434a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2054120,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Christian Bégin","original_name":"Christian Bégin","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6020e6035ed96200401bebb8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":143100,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Murray Siple","original_name":"Murray Siple","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6020e58a0c2710003ff19baf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589644,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michael Brockington","original_name":"Michael Brockington","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6020e5c7d6c300004065ab53","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1633175","wikidata_id":"Q5047441","facebook_id":"CartsOfDarkness","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aPtnGMgnY3fMlZqxOZMxvxSamSp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3VAv4IWjX1naAfMi8rCsjyorOoa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2523},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1417,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eNBgXnC25CPUbkaBGeakOVJixEh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2523}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1701,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7GcWrslIotd6knpgd4nQSVDNrhC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1134},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/idpLEKPGoTvyIsIk14PINV8QgF.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5XEoyw23Vwa1QPGvBYyh31jH9gi.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":1066},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wDqYWeWiyDuY4o91G6THogIq4D0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4U16jRV6rlE82pHYMHCCQsDOOKT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2981,"name":"homelessness"},{"id":9666,"name":"street race"},{"id":158993,"name":"man in wheelchair"},{"id":160223,"name":"vancouver"},{"id":170195,"name":"homeless man"},{"id":211044,"name":"alcohol problems"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"18A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: Film Poster (Hot Docs)","release_date":"2008-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Carts of Darkness Official Trailer: An extreme sport?
