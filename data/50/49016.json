It’s a story. The story stretches back to the ancient mountains of China, to the deep Canadian bush — from a parking lot big-air jump in Michigan to Norway’s Arctic Circle. It’s shouted from the top of Colorado’s Rockies and around the rocky rim of Lake Tahoe. This is a story that’s rewritten each winter, and one we’ll never tire of telling.
