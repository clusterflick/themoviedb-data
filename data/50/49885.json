A pirate without a straight leg, without a boat, treacherous and bloodthirsty and without the treasure map.  A baroness flamboyant, unscrupulous, praying mantis, penniless, but with a boat.  A young man without fear and without brains, but with the treasure map engraved somewhere in his failing memory.  A doctor without drinking, providential specialist of failing memories and other atypical amnesia ...  It is this dream team that sails anchor one morning in the year of grace a thousand and seven hundred and a few, towards the treasure island and its coves of pink sand.","popularity":1.317,"poster_path":"/i02oRvMfF5j2MX5NSR0pi2aSwta.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16026,"logo_path":null,"name":"FIT
