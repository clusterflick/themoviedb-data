His only friend is Julia, a shameless 15-year-old girl who is more than willing to help Pablo with his transition from childhood to adolescence, and give him some advice on sex, love, and life in general. On a quiet country road just outside of the village, Pablo meets Paco, an oddly calm, well-dressed stranger whose car just broke down. Nevertheless, he seems more interested in the boy than fixing his problem.","popularity":0.2993,"poster_path":"/cRCb1NAJZNks3xU8RNuR9mMMcJb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18429,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tiny Sumo Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":10659,"logo_path":null,"name":"Iván Noel Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A betrayal that ended a childhood.","title":"In Your Absence","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":21,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"En tu Ausencia","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Em Sua Ausência","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Wo warst Du?","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"В твоё отсутствие","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","title":"U tvom odsustvu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gonzalo Sánchez Salas","original_name":"Gonzalo Sánchez Salas","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Pablo Benitez","credit_id":"52fe478bc3a36847f813b85f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francisco Alfonsin","original_name":"Francisco Alfonsin","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/bLSng4FZgtsIPme0Mt1xm4aQ9x3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Paco","credit_id":"52fe478bc3a36847f813b857","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":141896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Salido Saborido","original_name":"Pedro Salido Saborido","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Adult Pablo","credit_id":"52fe478bc3a36847f813b85b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":141898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anabel Azuar","original_name":"Anabel Azuar","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Pablo's Mother","credit_id":"52fe478bc3a36847f813b863","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":141899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Tutor","original_name":"Ana Tutor","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Julia","credit_id":"52fe478bc3a36847f813b867","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":141900,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio J.
