Sharing the same lead actress (Brigitte Mira), cinematographer (Jürgen Jürges), and editor (Thea Eymèsz) as in Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s 1974 Film “Angst essen Seele auf”, these twin works offer a searing indictment of prejudice within German society.","popularity":0.1751,"poster_path":"/6zGrhhh1gehTC1eVHXIexXTeFHx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112882,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yilmaz Arslan Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angst isst Seele auf","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2726,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Mira","original_name":"Brigitte Mira","popularity":0.3219,"profile_path":"/aTscEqH9GSbQDlT7hnKFilvzNkf.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Emmi","credit_id":"54b41872c3a368210c00391d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre Sanoussi-Bliss","original_name":"Pierre Sanoussi-Bliss","popularity":0.1665,"profile_path":"/jFgVyAnBQcLE2kLzI3X2YKlFure.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mulu (voice)","credit_id":"62bad9eeabdafc0051df1b8b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1580648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Selim Dursun","original_name":"Selim Dursun","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Hirschke","credit_id":"62bada02229ae21211b43d5d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1887383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael J.
