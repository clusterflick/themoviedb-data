On checking out his decrepit estate the boys find one of their dad's ancient friends hiding in a closet with a bag full money. Whilst they decide what to do the pensioner is left to suffocate in the closet, leaving them with a much bigger problem to deal with; tell the police, or leave the body in his own home and pretend nothing happened (keeping the money in the process). This opens their world up to a series of bizarre incidents resulting in the village's quirky population gently decreasing during their short stay.","popularity":0.3019,"poster_path":"/v18GqHPHV9LaeV479Z8z92Yfq0K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Accidents will happen.","title":"The Drummond Will","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":142583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Drakes","original_name":"Jeremy Drakes","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Solicitor","credit_id":"52fe479ec3a36847f813f89f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Hansler","original_name":"Jonathan Hansler","popularity":0.1857,"profile_path":"/xJVuDrldtxddbGlQGZ67u9xyfRR.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Constable","credit_id":"52fe479ec3a36847f813f8a3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":142586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Jeffrey","original_name":"Victoria Jeffrey","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Betty the Barmaid","credit_id":"52fe479ec3a36847f813f8a7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":510105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Oosterveen","original_name":"Mark Oosterveen","popularity":0.1868,"profile_path":"/9ZrZhGRLCGTptMOij6cZSQ74Vn7.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marcus Drummond","credit_id":"52fe479ec3a36847f813f8ab","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":142585,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phillip James","original_name":"Phillip James","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Danny Drummond","credit_id":"52fe479ec3a36847f813f8af","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":142582,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Butterworth","original_name":"Alan Butterworth","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe479ec3a36847f813f89b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1657448","wikidata_id":"Q7731086","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8gLzg6goNV1r76EY0uzoWLOmsLz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":2.817,"height":398,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/htEspINCetxK8u5fLUOvX9TQr5i.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1121}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/v18GqHPHV9LaeV479Z8z92Yfq0K.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.71,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oCMpj2nwC65IBJF44FFc335Hhkq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":710},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hla2GF5uleGJIT7LAMVvGUDWGya.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8FmqmskyshbBWA3M3p4N6DXmGxN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Drummond Will - Trailer #2","key":"8RQiljV6rds","published_at":"2011-06-03T21:10:25.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6aac3a36854480057c0"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Drummond Will Trailer","key":"3RjQYTea1ko","published_at":"2010-09-30T10:02:33.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6aac3a36854480057bf"}]}}}
