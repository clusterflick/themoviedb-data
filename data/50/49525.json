And nearly 40% of babies who die in the province to die because of the violence of their parents. This explains the fact that nearly 30,000 children are supported by the DPJ until the age of 18. But this government agency is in a position to meet the needs of young people? Journalist and documentary filmmaker Paul Arcand presents the testimonies of children and adult victims of abuse of all kinds, and interviews politicians, social workers and members of the judiciary on their perception of the problem. In addition, Arcand denounces the carelessness of a bureaucratic system that does not always seem to be concerned about the well-being of those for whom they are responsible.","popularity":0.2628,"poster_path":"/m4ynF4PIyIULueidcoqseBdgF3S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":280,"logo_path":"/1rwkrpgsc0pWmkvEOabbPzEsGLi.png","name":"Cinémaginaire","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2005-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thieves of Innocence","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Arcand","original_name":"Paul Arcand","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/u3PY50uaWg5dYQ2BMcglicWqdvT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe479ac3a36847f813e8c7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1125946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathalie Simard","original_name":"Nathalie Simard","popularity":0.1431,"profile_path":"/iLxsrACFsIPBCmNWKBUoJtMWrJY.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe479ac3a36847f813e8db","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1038738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Bigras","original_name":"Dan Bigras","popularity":0.128,"profile_path":"/hja4DDInH0hRm2V7Hyo4vjeAN6Y.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe479ac3a36847f813e8cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1152708,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pauline Marois","original_name":"Pauline Marois","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/iLbQBKrXNu56efJittMsHgsOCtc.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self (archive footage) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe479ac3a36847f813e8d7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152707,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Lévesque","original_name":"René Lévesque","popularity":0.0361,"profile_path":"/oBz5iRyVcl62Ufo7YE9B3k33fi.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage) (uncredited)","credit_id":"52fe479ac3a36847f813e8cf","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Arcand","original_name":"Paul Arcand","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/u3PY50uaWg5dYQ2BMcglicWqdvT.jpg","credit_id":"52fe479ac3a36847f813e8e7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Arcand","original_name":"Paul Arcand","popularity":0.1155,"profile_path":"/u3PY50uaWg5dYQ2BMcglicWqdvT.jpg","credit_id":"52fe479ac3a36847f813e8e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6986,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniel Louis","original_name":"Daniel Louis","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c690956c3a3686fb6d61c73","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6987,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Denise Robert","original_name":"Denise Robert","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":"/4X5ey3K847bvdtXYIsiGOH8sRw1.jpg","credit_id":"5c690942c3a3686fb6d61c30","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0485165","wikidata_id":"Q3236151","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/wtB8HwXowYeEBMM5xaxn1kq1iW0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/m4ynF4PIyIULueidcoqseBdgF3S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":516,"name":"child abuse"},{"id":6086,"name":"government"},{"id":207691,"name":"abuse"},{"id":251982,"name":"dpj"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
