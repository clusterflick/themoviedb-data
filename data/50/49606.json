This rusty orange story is about the origins of TGR, outlaw athletes and the ragged lifestyle that has kept this posse's dream and way of life alive. The movement is stronger than ever with Nobis accomplishing the impossible in Alaska, the Olenicks taking their park skills to AK, Jeremy Jones straight-lining 50 degree spine walls, Sage fusing style and big mountain and Dana Flahr emerging as a dominate force in s kiing. This vagabond tale will take you through the lifestyle of skiing and the passion that continues to change the face of the sport. Take a ride in the orange truck that started it all on a rowdy road trip through India, Turkey, Switzerland, France, Alaska, Aspen, Utah, Montana, California and Jackson Hole.","popularity":0.2633,"poster_path":"/ybHGBBIRE7Lnz9WOz8mEaMSnh00.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11117,"logo_path":"/vkZJsXBKKfHZVLMDxuMktZXNmyA.png","name":"Teton Gravity Research","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"he Tangerine Dream is a film that represents 10 years of broken down trucks, whiskey bottles, wanderlust and the most down and dirty skiing and boarding you have ever seen.","title":"The Tangerine Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74459,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Jones","original_name":"Jeremy Jones","popularity":0.2128,"profile_path":"/lLSa6XXc0Tdn8JyKx9aRYXO411I.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fa0fcc6a097dc003759dbcb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1085112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Olenick","original_name":"Michael Olenick","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fa0fcd4417aaf0038e4d4c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2841829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Olenick","original_name":"Peter Olenick","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fa0fcebcb6db500372ea36b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":115016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victoria Jealouse","original_name":"Victoria Jealouse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5fa0fd06bdc34c00396c362d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":131974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karina Hollekim","original_name":"Karina Hollekim","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5fa0fd1b1c09fb00361ac94b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":588116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Nobis","original_name":"Jeremy Nobis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fa0fd282cff1800386f44b7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1114514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dylan Hood","original_name":"Dylan Hood","popularity":0.0418,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fa0fd38a097dc003959ceaf","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":571927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sage Cattabriga-Alosa","original_name":"Sage Cattabriga-Alosa","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/lWXSVO24az869nac6TRH2cp9H0.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fa0fd4d2cff1800396f2b6d","order":7}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0811617","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c97OPDMIHW7cwmQGOI4V7kjDrMb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.72,"height":1082,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ybHGBBIRE7Lnz9WOz8mEaMSnh00.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":779}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2006,"name":"extreme sports"},{"id":3522,"name":"snowboarding"},{"id":159558,"name":"snow skiing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Tangerine Dream - Ski Movie Trailer","key":"JacqyklEGNE","published_at":"2007-05-11T07:50:02.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec6aac3a36854480057c1"}]}}}
