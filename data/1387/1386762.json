This includes individuals who were directly impacted by the violence, as well as those who continue to struggle with the  social, economic, and political consequences of the conflict. While the actual violence and conflict may have ended, the legacy of the Troubles still lingers on in Northern Ireland; many are still struggling to come to terms with what happened and find a way to move forward.","popularity":0.2052,"poster_path":"/vasSxzNbak5fJrf28HMY5ypAyRH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":244541,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wagner
