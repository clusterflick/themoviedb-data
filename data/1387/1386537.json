But their marriage is not a happy one: Malcolm disrespects and ignores Clarissa, and Clarissa must suffer in silence for the good of her family. So when Clarissa meets Captain Phillip Burke, a Union surgeon who is a prisoner of war, she volunteers to assist him. Soon sparks fly both on the battlefield and behind closed doors. And even though Clarissa and Phillip are bound to others and to opposite sides of the war, their forbidden love seems doubly sweet - that is, until the fickle hand of fate intervenes. Based on Linda Swift's novel This Time Forever, Clarissa's War is an unforgettable story of love and hate set during the most tragic period of our nation's history.","popularity":0.0892,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clarissa's
