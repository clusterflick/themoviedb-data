Now they’re fighting back.  They want to create their own company, open their doors to other traumatised, talented, survivors, and together, ‘reclaim the stage’.  It won’t be easy. They’re young and fragile. They have no money or experience. But in a run-down studio, with a gender-fluid ballet insurgent to direct them, they fight for the chance to dance once again, with defiance, hope and joy.  They must confront their traumas if they are ever to take the stage again. It is a journey of pain, hope, resistance as they fight for justice & groundbreaking, liberated ballet.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":"/aDV2kvrbMZfgwK693N1eQ6oYflA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ballet abused these dancers.
