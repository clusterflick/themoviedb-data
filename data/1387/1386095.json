Using Yeonwoo Stage theater group's production Pannori Arirang Gogae as its subject matter, the film takes a unique approach by separating visual and audio elements - showing rehearsal scenes, preparation footage, dressing room moments, and performance scenes while overlaying them with live performance audio, audience reactions, interviews, and recordings from Yeonwoo Stage's evaluation sessions. The intentional dissonance between visual and audio elements is interpreted as a means to actively engage viewers with the film. The inclusion of edited interviews from various individuals as off-screen sound suggests an intention to reflect on reality and reconsider the meaning of both Pannori Arirang Gogae and the film Performance Arirang within that reality.","popularity":0.0549,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":244444,"logo_path":null,"name":"서울영화집단","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Performance Arirang","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231494,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Park Kwang-su","original_name":"박광수","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/jMdyUCGsZlIzBQ0fnOnV2Pi61EV.jpg","credit_id":"67320c3e4cee4fc8d5d18c82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1490002,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Hong-joon","original_name":"김홍준","popularity":0.0812,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67320c574cee4fc8d5d18c8b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hwang Gyu-deok","original_name":"황규덕","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67320c6661626ac106be75c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3298197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Moon Won-leep","original_name":"문원립","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67320c7db6a2a9f14a2b860f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
