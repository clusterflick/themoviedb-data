Nadhar is something of a relic, a slow man stranded in a frantic, productive society. For those around him, his slowness can at best serve as a derisory spectacle. An expansive meditation on human nature, slowness and being profoundly out of step with the world.","popularity":0.4965,"poster_path":"/gBR3Qdg6u4snUfgRozWA0wCgDG0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2025-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":179,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Slow Man and His Raft","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","title":"Nadharer Bhela","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1608209,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amit Saha","original_name":"Amit Saha","popularity":0.1135,"profile_path":"/4HC06Zj57Ntk5CuEvUuRPvyoQ5V.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Nadhar","credit_id":"67622eaf1f4a9572c4ffd7a7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1363545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ritwick Chakraborty","original_name":"Ritwick Chakraborty","popularity":0.3324,"profile_path":"/5UQBHY7BSYqfhuUtulX7fAwAc3G.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67622e9ecc2b6d9fccaaed55","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1294949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Priyanka Sarkar","original_name":"Priyanka Sarkar","popularity":0.709,"profile_path":"/aUJa73r2OBlhT4tznBgvFDqa0fG.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6765ca5c8e9d9ccdeb90d58a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1608207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aparajita Ghosh Das","original_name":"Aparajita Ghosh Das","popularity":0.1847,"profile_path":"/l3NQyAh5TQYPFjPT1no7AJjNnCb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"676af175607554482ba9e0a5","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1608200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pradipta Bhattacharyya","original_name":"Pradipta Bhattacharyya","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/fiBtIrt7b6mxbcTesFGiAlV2xOp.jpg","credit_id":"6732509561626ac106be84b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1608200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pradipta Bhattacharyya","original_name":"Pradipta Bhattacharyya","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/fiBtIrt7b6mxbcTesFGiAlV2xOp.jpg","credit_id":"67623058e14e3bcfa74a1ae9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1608200,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pradipta Bhattacharyya","original_name":"Pradipta Bhattacharyya","popularity":0.0739,"profile_path":"/fiBtIrt7b6mxbcTesFGiAlV2xOp.jpg","credit_id":"676af1a1603e6d0ef964a0fd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt35649140","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3En9NmCx4EfcDpdsKbbYNBDtTeG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":"bn","file_path":"/gBR3Qdg6u4snUfgRozWA0wCgDG0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1363}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IFFR","release_date":"2025-02-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
