As Nancy faces a health crisis that threatens to keep her from reuniting with her loved ones for Christmas, her family reflects on the lasting impact she has had on their lives. With rich moments of laughter, tears, and the comforting scent of fresh-baked cookies, The Cookie Grandma not only honors this one remarkable life, but also invites viewers to reflect on the \"moms\" and \"grandmas\" that shaped their own life.","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/eY8fHP23WoJi5VrKTqjKJB3jVNB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cookie Grandma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5053997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Addison Forras","original_name":"Addison Forras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6732c1cff0cd1a6bfc0f1faf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5053997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Addison Forras","original_name":"Addison Forras","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6732c1e1efcf344133b52c52","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5054000,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christine Shrum Marque","original_name":"Christine Shrum Marque","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6732c1f4a7fdc8608788c5ca","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2010774,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ken Conrad","original_name":"Ken Conrad","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6732c20f7ad3518f624281e2","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5054003,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carson Carr","original_name":"Carson Carr","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6732c24da7fdc8608788c5df","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5054006,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kevin O'Donnell","original_name":"Kevin O'Donnell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6732c282efcf344133b52c9e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":905,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eY8fHP23WoJi5VrKTqjKJB3jVNB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":603},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1670,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p1EOozGEnlICXA69GwQyEtsFtf7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1113},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1082,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/86wvp2tR7tDAJ31YWjMpGq6YsKr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":721}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
