Soon after celebrating with cake, Richard enacts a generational tradition that will change the children's lives forever. As the night unfolds, Michael, the youngest, tries to avoid the celebration to the best of his ability. Sarah, the oldest, questions the tradition they are about to take part in, and her role in it. While Robert, the middle child, gets progressively more irritated as the night unfolds, trying his best to make sure nobody ruins the night he’s been looking forward to his entire life. Mary becomes conflicted as to if she wants to initiate the tradition, while Richard is trying to make sure it doesn’t fall apart.","popularity":0.3784,"poster_path":"/xn4nsbMzL3JXFxYFsC7O4eBz9f1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
