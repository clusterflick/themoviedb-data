'The Black Irish' opens with a tongue-in-cheek advertisement for holidays in Kinsale. However, this is not Kinsale, Co. Cork, this is Kinsale on the island of Montserrat in the West Indies. Settled by Irish people in the 17th century, there are still reminders of Ireland everywhere. The flag, the accents, and the names.  The film features interviews with local resident Patrick Robert Reilly, (singing 'Mother Machree'!) school teacher Catherine Ryan, Cork man Barney Columbia, University Lecturer Dr. Howard Fergus, Post Officers Mr. and Mrs. Allen, and a Belgian Bishop, Anthony Demesne, all of whom provide evidence of 'Irishness'. The legacy of Irish immigrants lives on in the names, religion, accent, traditions and sentiment of many of the island's inhabitants.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÃ‰","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"AG","name":"Antigua and Barbuda"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Radharc: The Black Irish","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5055106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Lemass","original_name":"Peter Lemass","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"673383e61d72eb65f42e7610","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
