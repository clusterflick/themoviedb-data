More than 30 Chicagoans, including Irv Kupcinet, Studs Terkel, Shirley Belle Cole and Chuck Schaden share their heartfelt memories of Chicago. Snapshots and original music from that period accompany the narrative, depicting an era when life was simple -- a streetcar to the Loop was 7 cents, and a box of popcorn at the Marbro cost a nickel.","popularity":0.1097,"poster_path":"/htVga8OtKiuxhr4MIRs9SIRsmTY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50946,"logo_path":"/1lTs6kx4LNc48mypKt9F0y5X3XH.png","name":"WTTW/Chicago","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Nostalgic Look at Chicago in the 1920s, '30s and '40s","title":"Remembering Chicago","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5055154,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Phil Holdman","original_name":"Phil Holdman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673389c2b7370ea6dc41332b","department":"Sound","job":"Music Consultant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4705698,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Steve Larson","original_name":"Steve Larson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673389d5b7370ea6dc41333a","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4705696,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christine Taylor","original_name":"Christine Taylor","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67338a23b7370ea6dc41335d","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5055161,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jane Kaplan","original_name":"Jane Kaplan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67338a4ebc78ce2b94ba6b2a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169164,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dick Carter","original_name":"Dick Carter","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67338a64058164c40523e257","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4705689,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karen Szwed","original_name":"Karen Szwed","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67338a7830ee10aa1b9b18dc","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4705692,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lynn Pollack","original_name":"Lynn Pollack","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67338a8b678d3856a76b3e4f","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1846152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don DeMartini","original_name":"Don DeMartini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67338aaa058164c40523e28e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5055182,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Cal Langenberg","original_name":"Cal Langenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67338b1430ee10aa1b9b1955","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5055187,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Roy D.
