It's about building a future of possibilities and feeling freedom and pleasure when you can, especially when you're not taught to. It's about letting go of a 'homeland' to plant new homes and seeds of belonging within transness and queerness; it's about the power of quiet survival and the belonging in unbelonging.","popularity":0.0382,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birthed Right","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
