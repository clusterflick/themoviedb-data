There they offered the best imported records and it soon became a sanctuary. Musicians like Claudio Gabis, Nito Mestre, Charly García, Andrés Calamaro, agree that it was the place of freedom and inspiration that they so needed. It was the time when the avant-garde of the Di Tella Institute was nourished by the incipient rock and art, causing an explosion in the middle of a society isolated and lethargic by the repressive state apparatus. El Agujerito tells the story of this iconic record store through archival material and testimonies.","popularity":0.1138,"poster_path":"/h9Bj6FKmjfSmRgM7AoTenO1WKzP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":244552,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duermevela
