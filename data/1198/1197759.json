It also features Dr Swee Chai Ang working with injured children in the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza. Dr Swee was an eye witness to the Sabra and Shatila massacre in Beirut, about which she has testified at the Kahan Commission and written in her book From Beirut to Jerusalem, and she went on to found Medical Aid for Palestinians, with which she remains active today. \"Life Under Occupation\" was aired on BBC1 as an episode of Everyman, a documentary series that ran from 1977 until 2005 and which focused on religious and moral issues. Of related interest is \"A Very Stubborn Person,\" another UK TV documentary that profiles Dr Swee.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Under Occupation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4345263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Seddon","original_name":"Catherine Seddon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653da9c4e894a6011ca3a795","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
