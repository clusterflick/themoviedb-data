During her stay in New York, she added cinema to her art practice, and upon returning to Buenos Aires, she shot a number of short films. In Autogeografía, she puts her own body in front of the camera, articulating recording and representation in an early video-performance work. Derived from her action Comunicando con tierra (where she extracted soil from the Machu Picchu which she later exchanged with other Latin American Artists), a purification ritual takes place—Minujín covers herself up in “barbarity,” soil and grains that anonymous hands throw at her from out of field. A territory for exploration where the absurd embraces the real—“The only thing that is true is what we invent.”","popularity":0.0546,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1976-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Autogeografía","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3056819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marta Minujín","original_name":"Marta Minujín","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/7v5TC0Tc8FUfvYrApkUrEsr1iSo.jpg","credit_id":"653ddacfe894a600c5168b4d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1976-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
