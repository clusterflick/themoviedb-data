Her prior biology studies, her research with geometry and pictorial scales materialized in experiences with papers and pigments over wood, fabric or rice paper, giving shape to a body of work dominated by abstraction and symbolic narrative. “Energy transforms until it forms an image,” she would say, and that statement becomes palpable in her series La epopeya del ser beta, inspired by Aldo Pellegrini’s poetry. With the conviction of exploring other formats, drawings and paintings from this cosmological period are animated in celluloid. Shot on 16mm film and produced in collaboration with artist Ramiro Larraín, Algunos segmentos is a plastic unit of abstract motives and color planes to the rhythm of the music by the Improvisation Group of La Plata (GILP).","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1970-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Algunos segmentos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4345406,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elda Cerrato","original_name":"Elda Cerrato","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653dd9c9519bbb011b4522cd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1970-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
