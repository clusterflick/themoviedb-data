The film invites viewers to consider the mental resilience required to be an officer, with conversations surrounding trauma exposure, emotional labour, multiculturalism and personal experiences of coping. Through displaying the forceâ€™s involvement in a recent traumatic case, as well as the trauma encountered throughout their individual careers, the documentary offers the opportunity to go inside the policing mind.","popularity":0.1122,"poster_path":"/q3vALhX7NqnwY0xjMEmTPmVF4GW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Aiming to expose the extreme mental and emotional demands of being a police officer, After the Sirens is an intimate documentary that unmasks how mental health is perceived and addressed in the police force from first hand accounts.","title":"After the Sirens","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4343162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Beechey","original_name":"Chris Beechey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"653c14f00fb17f01009643c5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4343158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manny De Freitas","original_name":"Manny De Freitas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"653c14d4cc968300ea705ae2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4343163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brendan Flaxman","original_name":"Brendan Flaxman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"653c1500c8a5ac013a8654ef","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4343159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Maguire","original_name":"Jack Maguire","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"653c14de519bbb00fe5bcf70","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4343161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Sykes","original_name":"Emma Sykes","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"653c14e7109cd0010b02e6c0","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4343166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melissa De Freitas","original_name":"Melissa De Freitas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653cda34109cd0014df43b35","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4343166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melissa De Freitas","original_name":"Melissa De Freitas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653cdaa6cc968300c9e395c9","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4343166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melissa De Freitas","original_name":"Melissa De Freitas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653cdae55907de00c495ef0a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4343166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melissa De Freitas","original_name":"Melissa De Freitas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653c153fbc2cb3010b4a450c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4343166,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Melissa De Freitas","original_name":"Melissa De Freitas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653c155e0fb17f01009643d2","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1421,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yxGM5GOrKe0DxIgu1ivfFVNVbYz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2526},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1521,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7BfCnI7Nw4vCJzWwR4TxOPKTJWq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2704}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q3vALhX7NqnwY0xjMEmTPmVF4GW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lzWGdexAyUQgRKsedF4AW4UXQbg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6149,"name":"police"},{"id":159315,"name":"mental health"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"After the Sirens - Full Trailer","key":"ZVaiSa1UQuE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-07-07T09:16:34.000Z","id":"653c1e1ce894a600c515a0eb"}]}}}
