'Tragedies of the Osage Hills' was directed by James Young Deer, the first known Native American film director, and boasted a cast of “hundreds of real Indians.” Described as a dramatic thriller interwoven with a “tender love story”, the film’s premiere in Cushing, Oklahoma occurred just months after the arrest of Ernest Burkhart, the subject of Martin Scorsese’s similarly themed 2023 film 'Killers of the Flower Moon'. The 'Cushing Daily Citizen' described 'Tragedies of the Osage Hills' as having a fictitious ending of the Osage and white men united under an American flag.","popularity":0.5415,"poster_path":"/mUZURIGYq2t1o94zMciB5HcwgSk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":212183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thompson Moving Picture Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The most sensational picture of the age.","title":"Tragedies of the Osage Hills","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4342722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lillian A.
