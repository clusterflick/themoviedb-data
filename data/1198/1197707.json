Birds and Bats is a new parody musical that follows Bruce Wayne’s (AKA Batman) family and what happens when he suddenly disappears. As the family tries to cope with the sudden disappearance of Bruce, they quickly have to figure out what to do with Bruce’s newly discovered son, Damian Al Ghul. The Robins of the past (Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, and Timothy Drake) train Damian while Batgirl (Barbara Gordon) trains vigilante newcomer, Spoiler (Stephanie Brown). Things go from bad to worse when a new Gotham villain (Reflection) steps onto the scene vowing to kill anyone who has ever escaped death. As the show progresses the question over everyone’s head seems to be, what keeps a found family together when everything seems to be falling apart?","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1urakdFG4URe5c8lc998fugGIX6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":212234,"logo_path":null,"name":"Official Sidekick
