This is the title of the new film by the Brotherhood of the Macarena. This work, whose script was written by Carlos Colón Perales, who also directed it together with the Sevillian director Carlos Valera Bastida, with the collaboration of the production company Valdeluxe, and the voiceover by Antonio García Barbeito, revolves around the history and legend of the Brotherhood of the Macarena, throughout almost five centuries, of the sacred and spectacular beauty of its processional departure, at dawn on Good Friday, of the devotion that overflowed Seville from a neighborhood and of Seville's love for the Esperanza Macarena which, arriving to Rome, culminated in the canonical coronation of 1964, the fiftieth anniversary of which this Macareno Jubilee Year commemorates.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/m3Z7UCA4BXA8hO4CM5FnePEBSrR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":212201,"logo_path":null,"name":"Valdeluxe","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2013-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Esperanza
