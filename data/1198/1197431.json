The four films of Core Dump are rhizomatic assemblages of found footage, performance documentation and recorded interviews that form narrative portraits of the uncertainty in the nervous system of the digital earth.  The films are fragmented arrangements of images and sounds, with each chapter forming links across geographic and temporal discontinuities.","popularity":0.1088,"poster_path":"/sirXnqwlzT0NKHUwxXS8Mneg6WU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Core Dump: Dakar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3072756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Francois Knoetze","original_name":"Francois Knoetze","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653ccfc85907de0138e148b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1503,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sirXnqwlzT0NKHUwxXS8Mneg6WU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1002}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":196398,"name":"electronics"},{"id":221100,"name":"waste"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
