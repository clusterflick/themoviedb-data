Filmed primarily in Dahatia, a refugee camp run by UNRWA near Bethlehem on the West Bank, the film shows a new side to this continuing saga; the story of children growing up and learning to survive in an atmosphere of daily tension. In eye-opening interviews, the young people explain what it means to live in a strife-torn environment and how they have managed to survive and remain hopeful. Narrated by Casey Kasem, well-known in the USA for his \"Top 40\" music program, and featuring commentary by Hanan Ashrawi.","popularity":0.1419,"poster_path":"/hKLGYe46bioecEUvvT8ufMZgXZs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stolen Freedom: Occupied Palestine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":562168,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tony Kandah","original_name":"Tony Kandah","popularity":0.1267,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653da845cc9683014eb942a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hKLGYe46bioecEUvvT8ufMZgXZs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
