Mai, unlike Teng, is not a first time mother.  She went to Manila to work as housekeeper after her passport was faked by the agency that’s supposed to help her get a job abroad. On the other hand, Teng left Negros Occidental without her father’s consent. Her eagerness to provide for her family was driven by her mother who abandoned them. Their personal dilemma led them to a shelter where they receive proper care as they prepare for motherhood. Now that their stay has come to an end, they are bound to make the hardest decisions of their lives not just as daughters to their parents but as mothers to their babies.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/rM23BvEGgvzB3BblfaNUtm9QkwA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2021-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Light of the Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4344669,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jerome Avanzado","original_name":"Jerome Avanzado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653d397acc968300ea70e1e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1472,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rM23BvEGgvzB3BblfaNUtm9QkwA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":981}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
