The overworked Frank is forced to rest at the country home of his friend, Mr. Gray, where he meets and falls in love with the host's daughter, Kate. She refuses his proposal at first, but later accepts because her father, who has two younger children, is experiencing financial difficulties. Following the wedding, Kate is subjected to Frank's verbal abuse and seeks solace with Jack. Their friendship enrages Frank, who tortures them with his accusations. During a dinner party, Frank accuses Jack and Kate of being lovers in front of the male guests. Jack is restrained from accosting his father, but Frank suffers a fatal heart attack. Later, Jack and Kate fall in love and are married.","popularity":0.3866,"poster_path":"/KFbufqbCGSGr99aSa9751Jy3Bu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selznick Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"LOVE KNOWS NO LAW BUT NATURE'S","title":"Sealed Hearts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene O'Brien","original_name":"Eugene O'Brien","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/xgK8VBc7jLcbfpY1PPpRPRqkt1J.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jack Prentiss","credit_id":"653d73f85907de00ac01579f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Edeson","original_name":"Robert Edeson","popularity":0.1969,"profile_path":"/qWHUMZ3pBUhoDH781Zhnon9xRqu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Frank Prentiss","credit_id":"653d7442e894a600c516444e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1370586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucille Lee Stewart","original_name":"Lucille Lee Stewart","popularity":0.0679,"profile_path":"/ld2nbWCyHBobWchsJ9iaAR0c0IE.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Kate Gray","credit_id":"653d7469519bbb00ab68b1dd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":558289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Dean","original_name":"Jack Dean","popularity":0.0767,"profile_path":"/6s403NV9x6xHPYgD0KT9XL7T0yY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Gray","credit_id":"653d749bcc968300c9e3db5a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edmund Goulding","original_name":"Edmund Goulding","popularity":0.2422,"profile_path":"/l4h95dSKe2CGNfSuAIRZn7mnwma.jpg","credit_id":"653d74f4bc2cb3010b4aed48","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1796902,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eugene Walter","original_name":"Eugene Walter","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653d752b109cd0010b038cd9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2420894,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"R.
