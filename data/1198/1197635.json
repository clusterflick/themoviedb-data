Duesseldorf sees the most successful, major label Runrig lineup coming to the end of its run, with Donnie Munro making one of his last stands as lead vocalist and frontman, before leaving the band.  By the time of the Cologne concert, Bruce Guthro had settled into his role as the new frontman of Runrig, made it his own and been warmly accepted by fans. 1997 saw both the ending of the 'old' Runrig and their departure from London-based label Chrysalis.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Runrig - One Legend - Two Concerts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
