An underground community found refuge in a porn cinema that Ludlam rented at night to stage his theater of the ridiculous. In 1970 he premiered The Grand Tarot, an extravagant burlesque where the arcana became characters and a reading of cards before the performance began established the order of the scenes. Rollo Six materializes that furtive experience, recovering in its formal commitment the inventiveness of chance that guided Ludlam's work. Katz superimposes edited scenes in camera, fracturing the screen through the use of masks that cover the lens and allow him to separately expose each corner of the frame.","popularity":0.3562,"poster_path":"/2IKCye3a2GP6agqH9731KV1VPHh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":212160,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mirror on the Moon","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reel Six: Charles Ludlamâ€™s Grand Tarot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1139749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Black-Eyed Susan","original_name":"Black-Eyed Susan","popularity":0.0474,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"653bf7c5109cd0010b02de26","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1584684,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Brockmeyer","original_name":"John Brockmeyer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"653bf7cb719aeb00e1193963","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Ludlam","original_name":"Charles Ludlam","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"653bf7d1564ec7013c206f98","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105057,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mario Montez","original_name":"Mario Montez","popularity":0.1069,"profile_path":"/yFzOT9ZvKt8kbuQ9xxfiYiUP1FE.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"653bf7d95907de011bc4285a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4342967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lola Pashalinsky","original_name":"Lola Pashalinsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"653bf7e0109cd000ad61c7fb","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1863361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leandro Katz","original_name":"Leandro Katz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653bf7ebbc2cb300eafc25f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1863361,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leandro Katz","original_name":"Leandro Katz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653bf7b95907de011bc4284e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/56U7EZ8kLmUmf2xe47oLT4UvyAb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2IKCye3a2GP6agqH9731KV1VPHh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1987-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
