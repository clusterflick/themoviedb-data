Surrounded by the advancing exponents of modernity—distribution centers, highways, multinationals—he moves through the seasons at his own pace. We follow him for several years in his fields on the outskirts of Amsterdam. With the help of his best friend Rinus, he grows potatoes, beetroot, grain, and strawberries, which he sells from his barn. In between these activities, his farmhouse proves to be a gathering spot for neighbors and friends, who share with him their dry wit and simple joy.","popularity":0.291,"poster_path":"/srG1ntXTekpXvGWUfjUO4c8YqlH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Docmakers","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gerlach","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1295140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aliona van der Horst","original_name":"Aliona van der Horst","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":"/xheLYA7rGNbmiwXF6T9PBviZI3S.jpg","credit_id":"653e5ea85907de00ac01e1ee","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1484771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luuk Bouwman","original_name":"Luuk Bouwman","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653e5e98c8a5ac011d6d84bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29084082","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/BL3hTY4IzcGoAh4HX66TzWaWtf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tluMCZbK83yOewsjcwKWibWrk2s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2339,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/srG1ntXTekpXvGWUfjUO4c8YqlH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1559}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Shanghai International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"IDFA 2023","release_date":"2023-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"2023-12-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
