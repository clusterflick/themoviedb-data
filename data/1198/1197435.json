The music from the film, created together with the artists Mino Ceretti, Carlo Ruffini and Davide Mosconi, will then flow into the album Uno zingaro di Atlante con un fiore a New York, released by RCA in 1973. As Franco Quadri had already noted at the time, the structure of the film unfolds in three moments which, although contrasting, blend into each other harmoniously, from a visual and musical point of view.  The first is of an exquisitely conceptual nature and focuses on the constructive values ​​of the architectural measurement of space;  the second is characterized by a convulsive explosiveness bordering on pop and, finally, the third brings the gaze back to the natural order.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/zfx0z4CDmP0TFgiX6hFklvFKoIr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echo","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4344122,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mino Ceretti","original_name":"Mino Ceretti","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653cd39ccc9683010b3e7e6a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4344120,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianfranco Pardi","original_name":"Gianfranco Pardi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/354VYz2mtTgnLoPZx0rw8PmYnCd.jpg","credit_id":"653cd368bc2cb300eafc8ce2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4344128,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Davide Mosconi","original_name":"Davide Mosconi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653cd420bc2cb300c97e24b8","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4344120,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianfranco Pardi","original_name":"Gianfranco Pardi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/354VYz2mtTgnLoPZx0rw8PmYnCd.jpg","credit_id":"653cd43fcc9683014eb8e7b5","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4344124,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carlo Ruffini","original_name":"Carlo Ruffini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653cd3bcbc2cb3014d4a6d13","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":908,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/zfx0z4CDmP0TFgiX6hFklvFKoIr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":604}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285787,"name":"experimental"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
