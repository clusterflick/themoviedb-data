As said before, story-wise it is slight, which is true for the series in general, but the series is not about the stories. It's about the visuals and humour, as well as the animals. 'Speaking of Animals in South America' succeeds in those areas and the colourful Amazon setting helps give it the necessary zest.","popularity":0.136,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Speaking of Animals in South America","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lou Lilly","original_name":"Lou Lilly","popularity":0.0841,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67ae61c0f87b3796279f58cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4864078","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1942-12-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
