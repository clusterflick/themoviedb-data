Twice a year, in summer and in winter, fans gather at Tokyo Big Sight, an international exhibition center in Japan. Dojinshi or self-published works from a variety of genres are exhibited and sold. Considered the best of subcultural festivals, Comiket celebrates its 40th year in 2015. Unparalleled in scale and in history, the 3-day event brings 600,000 people from around the world. Despite its enormity, however, much remains unknown about the event. Who attends the event? What goes on inside? What new things are formed? This program offers an inside look at the seemingly familiar yet hidden world of Comiket.
