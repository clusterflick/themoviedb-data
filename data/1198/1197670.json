Instead of reacting with rage against the world, she mourns in her own different way: by going out, speaking publicly, and fighting to trade love for patriarchy for the sake of our society. By interweaving every-day moments with the story of our protagonist, the film tries to describe the banality of this evil. Mothers of Daughters pushes the boundaries of documentary filmmaking by poetically and sensitively trying to find imagery for this unbelievable story, that could happen to any of us.","popularity":0.1083,"poster_path":"/etW5yyPYY0dFwyijbcGuik9DjU3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":236409,"logo_path":null,"name":"Delta Pi","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2023-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mothers of daughters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2121761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eleni Karagiorgi","original_name":"Ελένη Καραγιώργη","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/zooqKlDAyhcls8R1fYw1IniB2BF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"daughter","credit_id":"654fdde929383543f0b7044f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2782584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Sigalou","original_name":"Ζωή Σιγαλού","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Friend","credit_id":"66bcc025fb08b8ab62825b4d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2365048,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elke Margarete Lehrenkrauss","original_name":"Elke Margarete Lehrenkrauss","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653d6955bc2cb3010b4aea1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1094730,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Youla Boudali","original_name":"Γιούλα Μπούνταλη","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/xwuu92V1SoD2SAeGkVQnHCuYuQm.jpg","credit_id":"654fdc3441a56133693e25cd","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1094730,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Youla Boudali","original_name":"Γιούλα Μπούνταλη","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/xwuu92V1SoD2SAeGkVQnHCuYuQm.jpg","credit_id":"654fdc1b29383543f4865b57","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/etW5yyPYY0dFwyijbcGuik9DjU3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"el","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
