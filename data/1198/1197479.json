Inside, he is hit on the head and whiskey poured on his uniform. Gangster Louis Cantor (Mathew Betz) and his henchmen have used this ruse to get him off his beat in order to rob a warehouse. The Police Commissioner (DeWitt Jennings), knowing Trent is innocent, suggests he be dismissed from the force and get a job with the gang. At Cantor's swank gambling establishment Trent finds his girlfriend, Molly Malone (Ada Ince), who has been searching for him. With the evidence he has gathered, Trent captures Cantor and calls for the police.","popularity":0.3205,"poster_path":"/9qbQFaBUaPS2WDpaShLwjwYjpJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74922,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scott-Bennet Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fighting Rookie","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99347,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack La Rue","original_name":"Jack La Rue","popularity":0.3044,"profile_path":"/wskA4CUxsCtRHiEI63FTAkkDXAL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Patrolman Jim Trent","credit_id":"653cf0dc5907de011bc4948e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1173095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ada Ince","original_name":"Ada Ince","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/ddzghdgT2pOwYCCMoBxQ8QexNcK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Molly Malone","credit_id":"653cf0f1519bbb00c433ccc7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"DeWitt Jennings","original_name":"DeWitt Jennings","popularity":0.0497,"profile_path":"/xW7FxW2kwQqaIZpNcfACbFeFbBp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Police Commissioner","credit_id":"653cf10e109cd0012cfef062","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138220,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Betz","original_name":"Matthew Betz","popularity":0.1197,"profile_path":"/tpGMjJrquUADwkV8ZXJLofwNy8d.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lewis Cantor","credit_id":"653cf120bc2cb3010b4ab127","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Belasco","original_name":"Arthur Belasco","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Bates","credit_id":"653cf1325907de011bc494b0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121238,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Taliaferro","original_name":"Hal Taliaferro","popularity":0.2491,"profile_path":"/xAg9Rx5g3M58oPE46eD6yJK9ea5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Gambler","credit_id":"653cf144519bbb00c433ccf6","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Spencer Gordon Bennet","original_name":"Spencer Gordon Bennet","popularity":0.4206,"profile_path":"/sgw3I1GQ24pDnzNClxbADPuyp92.jpg","credit_id":"653cefeee894a600ad568ba7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1176363,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Paul Palmentola","original_name":"Paul Palmentola","popularity":0.0797,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653d1ec0cc9683014eb9077b","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117578,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fred Bain","original_name":"Fred Bain","popularity":0.0389,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653d1ecd519bbb00fe5c4995","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34802,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"James S.
