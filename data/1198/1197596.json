In a succession of tableau-like scenes, we follow the twists and turns in the relations of ten individuals gathered in an apartment on a warm Sunday evening. In a stylized and fragmentary story that unfolds via monologues and dialogues charged with repressed hostility or unconcealed jealousy and bitterness, the artists explore the areas of tension between people, in particular those domains where social and political conflicts find their reflection in the personal.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2Ry8mY1FQMMzShDiGjbKNPygFAt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mandarin Ducks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511757,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeroen de Rijke","original_name":"Jeroen de Rijke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bb12b71fd36f017d725969","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4511760,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Willem de Rooij","original_name":"Willem de Rooij","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65bb12e12b8a4301611aae05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0819698","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":945,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2Ry8mY1FQMMzShDiGjbKNPygFAt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":630}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
