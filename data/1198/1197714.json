Meanwhile, Dr Frankenstein is using the corpses from the graveyard to create his super-man. His work is interrupted when Ron Hardon and fat (male) wife Adelaida seek the doctor's expertise in helping them conceive a baby. Dr Frankenstein realizes that Adelaida must have breasts to become a mother, so he operates accordingly. A bit later, Ron catches his wife having oral sex with Frankenstein and becomes angry. But his anger turns quickly to joy, when Adelaida is suddenly pregnant and instantly has a baby. However the baby dies and, when Ron can't afford another medical session, the couple becomes lethargic. Dr Frankenstein decides to use Ron's body for his super-man experiments, killing him and then reviving him.","popularity":0.1214,"poster_path":"/1oloR0qOkmZ4aBIm8DegksK9psE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alan Smithee's Frankenstein","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1163565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vic Cicuta","original_name":"Vic Cicuta","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":"/hVC3Y5iXgLfevISMo0GiPccPqFN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"653d7dd0e894a600ad56c36c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":31330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leandro De la Torre","original_name":"Leandro De la Torre","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"653d7de0e894a600c51647c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2621544,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hernán Panessi","original_name":"Hernán Panessi","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/f0gl3mLZKg8fN6kDbsaXHTSPynB.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"653d7dec519bbb0138324a7d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3612606,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ezequiel Piñeyro","original_name":"Ezequiel Piñeyro","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"653d7df3109cd0012cff2f74","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2190255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramón Caribe","original_name":"Ramón Caribe","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6761acbe328322fcf318a6b6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germán Magariños","original_name":"Germán Magariños","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":"/to9MEjlrbs5Q2dF1IwAMD2TVv37.jpg","credit_id":"653d7dc0cc968300ade6c7c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2833216","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1oloR0qOkmZ4aBIm8DegksK9psE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
