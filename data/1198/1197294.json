In this age of digital avatars, he crafts a version of himself that is far more corporeal - by stitching together parts of himself to become his own cyborg twin. He calls this miraculous being into existence with a techno-magick concoction of symbology and code, and for a while they enjoy a strange and touching get-to-know-you-better of the self. But the cyborg has been corrupted by a cyberfeminist virus. This Other self embodies a dangerous idea: that there are parts of ourselves beyond our control. This lo-fi sci-fi features two transgender men, performing a very queer version of their own lives. It is an experimental hybrid of documentary, fiction and performance art.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/44djHgeExp84RBVu1lVgoh5WGiv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MyMy","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1843791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Shoulder","original_name":"Justin Shoulder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"653c4ae50fb17f00c85ba7ff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4343637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vincent Silk","original_name":"Vincent Silk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"653c4aec109cd0014df3ea96","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4343638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Stacy","original_name":"Jackson Stacy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"653c4af6e894a6011ca2f001","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2472999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anna Helme","original_name":"Anna Helme","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653c4ad7cc968300ade63a99","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3531814","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/44djHgeExp84RBVu1lVgoh5WGiv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
