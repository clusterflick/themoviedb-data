In Belfast, hockey is bringing Northern Irish youth together in a shared love of the game, providing a respite from the Protestant-Catholic turf warfare that pervades their lives. Set against the backdrop of a post-conflict society, the film provides an intimate glimpse into the realities of life in Belfastâ€”the 12-metre-high walls that divide Catholic and Protestant, the precautions Andrew and Paul must take to be friends, and the safety they find on the rink at Dundonald.","popularity":0.0847,"poster_path":"/umY8BDAArze0YGrMcloNseYGj1K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Hockey Came to Belfast","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4344324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Conway","original_name":"Linda Conway","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653cf0dc5907de00e1a1d499","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4344324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Conway","original_name":"Linda Conway","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653cf1ccbc2cb300c97e32cf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1029848,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Selwyn Jacob","original_name":"Selwyn Jacob","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653cf1ebc8a5ac011d6cd673","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3227262,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shelly Hamer","original_name":"Shelly Hamer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"653cf201c8a5ac0100f9d81d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/umY8BDAArze0YGrMcloNseYGj1K.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
