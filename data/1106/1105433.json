The film centers primarily around the stories of Sarah Hart and KC Haywood, two modern American nomads in search of adventure who stumble upon a wild, fledgling community of anarchistic kickballers upon their arrival in Chicago. They quickly find themselves immersed in a vibrant culture of creativity, love, play, and excess that embraces them as family. With the kickball league growing larger, structure, rules and competition creep into this anarchist's Garden of Eden and threaten to destroy its innocence and purity. As the community deals with these new challenges, disaster strikes unexpectedly when a freak accident hospitalizes one of their own. After rallying to support their friend and each other during this difficult time, it becomes clear that love, friendship, and the zest for life triumph over tragedy.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vPuZzioXscMd1LRi3uBwjzvxeQ6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The official story of Chicago's unofficial kickball league.","title":"Left Field","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982054,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Adam Blaszkiewicz","original_name":"Adam Blaszkiewicz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6421c4ee08cf8700a0156fb7","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982049,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Lawrence Adams","original_name":"Lawrence Adams","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6421c48c08cf8700bfee6824","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982047,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benjamin Steger","original_name":"Benjamin Steger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6421c45c53466100857a842e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982050,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Batte","original_name":"Chris Batte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6421c49a23be4600c0f65ffc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982052,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ian Miller","original_name":"Ian Miller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6421c4bc2dc9dc00de0d80f5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3260813,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"James Cadenas","original_name":"James Cadenas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6421c5118d22fc008403ce0e","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1399283","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":1402,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vPuZzioXscMd1LRi3uBwjzvxeQ6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
