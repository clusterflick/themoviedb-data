The implicit voyeurism and exaggerated hyperfeminity of such images are complicated by the accompanying sound track, in which the artist’s rendition of Chris Isaac’s melancholy pop song Wicked Game is punctuated by her repeated shrieking of the lyrics “I don’t want to fall in love.” Although she denies having an explicitly feminist agenda, Rist frequently merges eroticism and coquettishness with aggression and hysteria to produce provocative fantasies of female empowerment.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/A89r0B3kMmN6vDf35W0uYg969yJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sip My Ocean","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272324,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pipilotti Rist","original_name":"Pipilotti Rist","popularity":0.0776,"profile_path":"/4HWQlRBBel6h3fURlYTaFIIrysP.jpg","credit_id":"6421961808cf8700defef7f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12564372","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":917,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A89r0B3kMmN6vDf35W0uYg969yJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":611}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
