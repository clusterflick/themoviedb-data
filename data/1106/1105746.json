Without denying his genius, Manuelle Blanc examines the heroic figure of the artist in the Resistance, sifting through the reality of historical events and his actions. Drawing on archive footage and the insights of specialists (academics, critics and art historians), her film sheds light on the weaknesses, contradictions and ambiguities of the man who remains, half a century after his death, an undisputed icon of modern art.","popularity":0.0865,"poster_path":"/ilKXA4PH5goDXnTzb4zfXzNXS0x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46356,"logo_path":"/gwaoRQcAzCmsKv1z6L4D2nr0DBB.png","name":"Folamour Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Picasso sans légende","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":563891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pablo Picasso","original_name":"Pablo Picasso","popularity":0.1619,"profile_path":"/g2PSb8WdVPI6rKlK494mh6HADhU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"642b2e7ea3e4ba4ac6f87694","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1859656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuelle Blanc","original_name":"Manuelle Blanc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6422ae896a344800862683d2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27419153","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ud3EMB6b5q7B0TuOmCcHRrst5ge.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ilKXA4PH5goDXnTzb4zfXzNXS0x.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/w47ZiqhNHQ86V1sqLSQmMg8FiKG.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
