Along the way, the two record stories of the people that work in the parks and those that come to enjoy them, as part of the rich tapestry of the history of the park system emerges. Far from any clich√©d narrative, they hear profound stories of people from all ages, walks of life, and cultures that come to the parks seeking tranquility, healing, motivation, and connection to the natural world. Between the spectacular shots of the parks and compelling interviews are colorful bits of old maps, posters, and travelogues. This stunning road trip is a tribute to the national parks and their history, and is also a recognition of the people that appreciate them and work to maintain their beauty.","popularity":0.0448,"poster_path":"/uwVVmfXY7PycjTKHeanyjVX3DAB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out There: A National Parks Story","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2014602,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brendan Hall","original_name":"Brendan Hall","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642314012dc9dc00de0e101d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27441206","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hhvbR6r5025s8Q9wsSdcTvrVWyR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":2963,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uwVVmfXY7PycjTKHeanyjVX3DAB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Florida Film Festival","release_date":"2023-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
