But speaking privately to little Christian, Father Siro appears anything but reassuring, revealing to the child that a long and tortuous journey awaits him in his adult life: during his baptism Christian 'saw' the archangels cleanse the face of Christ from the wounds of his human suffering, and Christian himself will live an existence soiled and raped by pain.","popularity":0.0673,"poster_path":"/tW8xCPpnJnFUps3BwPtye9vt1MB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gli Arcangeli","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1471083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Riva","original_name":"Andrea Riva","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/cY2HMzvNPUGMRdXpwzNtcN2LliG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Christian","credit_id":"64231e730745e10077379fe9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":119366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesca Inaudi","original_name":"Francesca Inaudi","popularity":0.1853,"profile_path":"/3WXzvaRhbLZX9hWwox1aiF77fAl.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Marlena","credit_id":"64231e8b0c4c160113d1b022","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1471081,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simone Scafidi","original_name":"Simone Scafidi","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/hJybso4kE40has3VT4KhXdruC7a.jpg","credit_id":"64231e39976e480077ed34c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":847,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tW8xCPpnJnFUps3BwPtye9vt1MB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":599}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
