Combining different techniques from animation to archive material the film follows glow-worm’s attempts to find a partner in an environment that is no longer dark at night. The story about light and darkness moves from the scale of planetary to microscopic, from the calmness of nature to a hectic city and from artificial light to the green shimmer of a glow-worm’s behind.","popularity":0.2333,"poster_path":"/8G8Kcmg02Wl3x2GPJRRrn3RUBmr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33385,"logo_path":"/mwYzhJn7rRNr6cb695jJET72EoT.png","name":"Illume","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2023-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strangers in the Dark","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1413525,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Perttu Inkilä","original_name":"Perttu Inkilä","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6421e6fb23be4600c0f66a96","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3982213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jenni Pystynen","original_name":"Jenni Pystynen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/u8kP4H6Jck4ELEPENytQ0RxulCi.jpg","credit_id":"6421e7032dc9dc00fd1c15f1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3522409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viktor Toikkanen","original_name":"Viktor Toikkanen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642c7d378de0ae00978ee49d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2259046,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jussi Sandhu","original_name":"Jussi Sandhu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642c7d49d100b600c54ab0e9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3690589,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Henri Tondi","original_name":"Henri Tondi","popularity":0.0721,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642c7dbe8de0ae00b6567bc2","department":"Camera","job":"Grip"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2262174,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Joonas Saine","original_name":"Joonas Saine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/tLjBuh2K24BXwVOTUvv0x1pNfZu.jpg","credit_id":"642c7ddc6e44bf0111a0f978","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3345026,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Teemu Rosenqvist","original_name":"Teemu Rosenqvist","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642c7df3c0442901f003d010","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Technician"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8G8Kcmg02Wl3x2GPJRRrn3RUBmr.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":829,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xvc7GfsFTtKsReQGR5r8kvNLtKt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":553}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":178902,"name":"firefly"},{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
