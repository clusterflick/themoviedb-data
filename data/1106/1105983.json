Struggling with her environment, she is determined to redefine her identity. She finds herself on a route that leads to fame, notoriety, and what others consider success. Once she receives the spotlight she had only once dreamed of, she finds herself a lost soul. A lost soul who is detached from her past, and missing from her present, because the world she pined for didnâ€™t fulfill what was missing for her inside. In a search for internal peace, she finds spirituality through the Church. The choir songs lead her to the only important truth - faith.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LOST SOULS","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
