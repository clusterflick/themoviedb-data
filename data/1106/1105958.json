She would play songs from previous albums, including “Cactus Tree” from her 1968 David Crosby–produced debut and “Chelsea Morning” from Clouds, but the majority of her 11-song set came from her then-new album, Ladies of the Canyon. With tracks like “Big Yellow Taxi” and “The Circle Game” — the latter her response to Neil Young’s “Sugar Mountain” — Ladies of the Canyon marked Mitchell’s first platinum record. It was also her first to feature the piano, an instrument she’d use to produce warm, introspective songs less than a year later on Blue.","popularity":0.1544,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1970-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joni Mitchell: In Concert at the BBC","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":76138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joni Mitchell","original_name":"Joni Mitchell","popularity":0.1108,"profile_path":"/NSdryvQJs9GfCgnEFRsSXp2bP3.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"64234b2ed19a330077c0aca1","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1970-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
