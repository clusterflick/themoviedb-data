This film follows the story of three women in Scotland who, at the wake of the crisis, show their support for the people of Ukraine in small but heartfelt ways. In following their stories, the film shows ordinary people finding meaning and overcoming powerlessness through everyday acts in their local communities. These stories show our deep need to connect and resist and, whether we can change the world or not, are a bittersweet yet hopeful reminder of our common humanity. In the words of Volodymyr Zelenskyy \"home is also the front line\".","popularity":0.0851,"poster_path":"/2KtFnj3PUysWNqHpYNOC8gttmvJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"As the war in Ukraine erupts, people in Scotland show their solidarity in ways big and small.","title":"Home Fronts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3981171,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Sapouna","original_name":"Maria Sapouna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6420ea5268929c00a05ce795","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3761252,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Luis Maurizzio","original_name":"Luis Maurizzio","popularity":0.0542,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6420ea798d22fc00cc0f0c0a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2497673,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dimitris Manousiakis","original_name":"Dimitris Manousiakis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6420eaa76a3448007bb5c8e3","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3981172,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yiotis Beretzikis","original_name":"Yiotis Beretzikis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6420ea6d8d22fc01128a759f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1456211,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"C.J.
