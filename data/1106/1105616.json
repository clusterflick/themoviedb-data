Rage at his humiliation and inability to marry as a free man smolders in him throughout his servitude, near the end of which he sails to San Francisco with the Drew family. Also on board is Ralph Coolidge, who tries to retrieve from Drew his share of their gold mine, and who loves Drew's secretary, Mary-Will Tellfair. Shortly after their arrival, Henry Drew is murdered; suspicion falls on Ralph, the owner of the murder weapon, a curious Chinese dagger; but subsequent events lead Hung Chin Chung to confess to the crime.","popularity":0.2312,"poster_path":"/9KEML1BNyK2VUzWPPGeMd4ei8Vj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72164,"logo_path":null,"name":"Irvin V.
