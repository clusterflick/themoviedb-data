There is an ambiguity in their hierarchy. They might be perceived apart, joined together, one after the other, or one dominates the other out completely. This ‘relationship’ is what I am intuitively exploring. Film sees the unconscious neither as rational, or irrational. Film is a system of relations.” — E.B. 1977","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/u6hkOJTBSA5EzTLr4u3GZLYWMYl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hit and Run","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3980822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul McMahon","original_name":"Paul McMahon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"64209c7e23be4600df990b88","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ericka Beckman","original_name":"Ericka Beckman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/kvyQpJ0lc2MtyksTASH64kXl0Yo.jpg","credit_id":"64209c402dc9dc00bf59088a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ericka Beckman","original_name":"Ericka Beckman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/kvyQpJ0lc2MtyksTASH64kXl0Yo.jpg","credit_id":"64209c572dc9dc007c067dad","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ericka Beckman","original_name":"Ericka Beckman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/kvyQpJ0lc2MtyksTASH64kXl0Yo.jpg","credit_id":"64209c5f8d22fc01128a5b54","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ericka Beckman","original_name":"Ericka Beckman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/kvyQpJ0lc2MtyksTASH64kXl0Yo.jpg","credit_id":"64209c688d22fc00cc0ef118","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1350626,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ericka Beckman","original_name":"Ericka Beckman","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/kvyQpJ0lc2MtyksTASH64kXl0Yo.jpg","credit_id":"64209ca753466100cd40478f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679688,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brooke Halpin","original_name":"Brooke Halpin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64209cbe08cf8700fd86fbe1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u6hkOJTBSA5EzTLr4u3GZLYWMYl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
