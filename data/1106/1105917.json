She’s a college student excited for some quality time with her dad, but all of the sudden, he’s not answering his phone. As she waits for him, she looks for a way to fill the time. That’s when she meets a sensitive, long-haired surfer, an intimate connection that complicates her weekend even further. Built around body language and eye contact as much as dialogue, Offenberger’s film is a richly observed exploration of the emotions and needs of a daughter with an unpredictable father.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"San Clemente Syndrome","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15464480","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
