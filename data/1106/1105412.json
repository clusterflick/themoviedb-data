Helga is shown to be an over-anxious mother who worries excessively about her daughter. She even resorts to calculating the approximate time Ida will take to reach the shop. As night starts to fall, and Ida doesn't return, Helga becomes worried about her daughter, going so far as to phone the shop to see if Ida is there, but she is told that Ida never arrived. Helga and her sister Ruth search for Ida but to no avail. Finally they call the police.","popularity":0.335,"poster_path":"/r4iZim568tLXj4g9iTPhuFptkCP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109843,"logo_path":"/iwkwIEXWIPApzedElW5sY8LFZSx.png","name":"NRK","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":177,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black
