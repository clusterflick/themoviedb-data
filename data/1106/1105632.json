Accordingly, it is a huge album that musically feeds on the current sound of French and American role models as well as the East and West Coast rap of the nineties.

However, only making a joint album would be out of the question for calibers such as Haftbefehl and Xatar. That's why a film was shot without further ado. The album \"Der Holland Job\" is  accompanied by the short film \"Der Holland Job.\"","popularity":0.0975,"poster_path":"/zhJ4T2JeAVcPG9E10Kxc5NIfzzh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":196643,"logo_path":null,"name":"Four Music Production GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Holland Job","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haftbefehl","original_name":"Haftbefehl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"64225b8508cf8700fd87ca3a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2018675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xatar","original_name":"Xatar","popularity":0.0484,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64225b71c7a7e000a37b822c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2520216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazım Demirbaş","original_name":"Kazim Demirbas","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"659462dc028f1476eac6df35","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Giosh","original_name":"Laura Giosh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64225b6053466100857abf9c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ayfer Kızıl","original_name":"Ayfer Kızıl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"64225dfb2dc9dc007f0e0416","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2314271,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabian Köster","original_name":"Fabian Köster","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"64225e138d22fc007c0063f0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andre van Noord","original_name":"Andre van Noord","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"64225e3e8d22fc01128b2fa6","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982777,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mira Rosenmeier","original_name":"Mira Rosenmeier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64225e906a34480112ba7136","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982778,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Aleksander Kenanov","original_name":"Aleksander Kenanov","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64225ebe6a344800a90b26c5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3982769,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cihan Can","original_name":"Cihan Can","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64225c26c7a7e000a37b82b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2034670,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kubilay Sarikaya","original_name":"Kubilay Sarikaya","popularity":0.1058,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64225bf3c7a7e0007d20c921","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zhJ4T2JeAVcPG9E10Kxc5NIfzzh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"DVD","release_date":"2016-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Coup (Haftbefehl & Xatar) - Der Holland Job / Teaser","key":"w4vrXGYihLE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-05-27T12:44:50.000Z","id":"6422602e23be460082b375b8"}]}}}
