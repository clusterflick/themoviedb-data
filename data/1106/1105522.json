A name that hardly evokes anything, or not much, even in the heart of Chamonix, the Mecca of mountaineering. And yet, the one nicknamed “the Greek” in the 1950s, because of his paternal ancestry, was undoubtedly one of the most important French mountaineers of his time. High mountain guide, Yann Borgnet, is also passionate about the history of mountaineering. “The Greek” is one of the “old ones” who particularly marked him. Yann wants to follow in Georges’ footsteps. So the young guide imagines an alpine journey, designed to visit the great routes opened by Livanos. A dive into the heart of an immense vertical heritage, to meet a great, almost forgotten, figure of mountaineering and his heritage.","popularity":0.293,"poster_path":"/3xCdqM31WqUvUy9XFAuE81spRJI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103653,"logo_path":"/d8hY0usq5lvPmj2YtriyrV8oN56.png","name":"La Cuisine aux
