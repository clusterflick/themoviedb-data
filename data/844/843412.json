They enjoy evening festivities with their older teenage friends by the fire, go on mellow skateboard rides, and have a quiet daytime nap in the garden house. Caressed by the sun and the warmth of his relatives, hidden in the quiet tranquillity of the garden and far away from the cruelty of the outside world, Vadim enjoys his childhood days. Acting as a serene lullaby that mimics the movements of a gentle breeze, Summer provides warmth, joy and solace, offering hope and strength for the future.","popularity":0.1452,"poster_path":"/uG8BEoDhrX2NXQaPPLngkPEmP4L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157682,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mal de Mer Films","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Leto","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2871947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vadim Kostrov","original_name":"Vadim Kostrov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yz8dlX3NXhGFYdqCiV43HwFgubi.jpg","credit_id":"60d08e550f1e58002c92d840","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3131656,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gleb Piryatinskiy","original_name":"Gleb Piryatinskiy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d08e80fbe36f005d222670","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2871947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vadim Kostrov","original_name":"Vadim Kostrov","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yz8dlX3NXhGFYdqCiV43HwFgubi.jpg","credit_id":"614e0adaed2ac2008b50d643","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13884328","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.717,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uG8BEoDhrX2NXQaPPLngkPEmP4L.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":538},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/suiLSgO1tZXyoFL3au2M14KaKZD.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1335,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8GWesNsovHgcnsU5WviL9Yea3FE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":890},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/feeVmT62NibdJEXUEjknmb3pVMq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sheffield Doc/Fest","release_date":"2021-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"New Holland Island International Debut Film Festival","release_date":"2021-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Summer/ЛЕТО Trailer","key":"9oSY_ZS4IOA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-05-19T16:27:22.000Z","id":"60d08f19ecaef5002d2f9316"}]}}}
