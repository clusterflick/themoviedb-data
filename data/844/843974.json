After posting a Craigslist ad in the Casual Encounters section seeking a participant for a video, Tam responded with a project of his own.  After repeated discussions, both the artist and participant ultimately agreed upon a set of conditions that attempted to satisfy both of their respective needs. The participant's frustrated intentions quickly came into tension with the artist's own refusal to fully acquiesce to his demands, yet at the same time Tam's prerogatives as an artist required him to compromise his position and meet the participant halfway.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/aBENwCVcHm8UXZPgR7hkcrh3Sax.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The compression is not subservient to the explosion; it gives it increased force","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2230874,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kenneth Tam","original_name":"Kenneth Tam","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60d279bfc9dbf900270ed9ae","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1040,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aBENwCVcHm8UXZPgR7hkcrh3Sax.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
