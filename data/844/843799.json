The US wants to get its hands on the #WikiLeaks founder in what the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture called \"the collective persecution\" by a group of \"democratic\" states. If convicted, Assange could face decades in a US jail. In April 2019, Julian Assange was dragged out of the Ecuadorian embassy and sent to Belmarsh Prison for breaching his bail terms. Through WikiLeaks, Julian Assange published a trove of classified documents on the powerful elite, including war crimes committed by the military on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and embarrassing details from politicians' emails. The Assange Story pieces together accounts from Assange's friends, family and former colleagues to build up a clearer understanding of the personality and motivation in the man behind what's been called the 'biggest leaks in intelligence history'.","popularity":0.1081,"poster_path":"/wvA0bLaccKUgylgVZUDsogQ6vYF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85078,"logo_path":null,"name":"RT Documentary","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"WikiLeaks founderâ€™s journey from whistleblowing hero to exile","title":"The Assange Story","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150882,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Assange","original_name":"Julian Assange","popularity":0.2571,"profile_path":"/v5RJRSLHISrQsToSMMw8ixMml5w.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"(archive)","credit_id":"60d1cbf435c30a00270bf467","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2480648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Artyom Somov","original_name":"Artyom Somov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d1cc9dc9dbf9005c0b7e1e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3132688,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Konstantin Rozhkov","original_name":"Konstantin Rozhkov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d1cc6a0a517c00452f0f49","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wvA0bLaccKUgylgVZUDsogQ6vYF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"RT Documentary ","release_date":"2020-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
