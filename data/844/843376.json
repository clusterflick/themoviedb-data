His mother has left the family and his father is an alcoholic. The boy is a very violent troublemaker. The stand out point of \"A Crevice of Violence \"is that it doesn’t only show the cycle of violation but actually questions on how to exit this vicious cycle. The film tries to find a way through the attitude of his remarried mother and his judge in charge and the facial expression of the boy when he meets them.","popularity":0.3095,"poster_path":"/2jsoQpJdMcmLRgoT7prca7WGA0V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60264,"logo_path":"/dufUwEz5RcpEDe8UZtyXcFE5Yxa.png","name":"Korea National University of Arts","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2015-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Crevice of Violence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1678535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seo Jae-kyu","original_name":"Seo Jae-kyu","popularity":0.0448,"profile_path":"/sAc5oEj697v3ckpJ2v9vkJjzke.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ki-hyuk","credit_id":"60d2896365e0a200747c4f79","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1344158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeong Do-won","original_name":"Jeong Do-won","popularity":0.1435,"profile_path":"/rhtDzCPE2FEBVvMIoeVihvu0VHi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Judge","credit_id":"60d289de8d1b8e005eb7a840","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1615316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Hak-ju","original_name":"이학주","popularity":0.791,"profile_path":"/gajjcFdyWx49Mlca4JwTVe3zr87.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Chung-hee","credit_id":"60d28ab2e54d5d0047babebd","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1860479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gwon Gi-ha","original_name":"Gwon Gi-ha","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/yqpEnDc2vAzQozNiKIrX3pnsGHq.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Han-sung","credit_id":"60d28ac867b613002c64b39e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3131577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lim Cheol","original_name":"Lim Cheol","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d068662385130074bdd95c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3131577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lim Cheol","original_name":"Lim Cheol","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d0685a2385130028978a9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2jsoQpJdMcmLRgoT7prca7WGA0V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7920,"name":"violence in schools"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
