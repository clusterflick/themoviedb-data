Repetition is explored as a principle of memory, as an aesthetic device, a space to inscribe meaning. Repetition is also explored as historical mimesis, as an eternal return, and as a possibility for reinvention. Finally, repetition is a means to question the role of agency in human nature. This image-based study is a work in progress and is carried out incrementally, whenever the need arises to examine, excavate and repeat the memory.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2QFC9GsHmR2YmdKr2K3o2BfM9V6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradox of Time : Studies in Memory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1138259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bani Khoshnoudi","original_name":"Bani Khoshnoudi","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/tjIR0BwDAUg1xyY2EHxRLkbVskL.jpg","credit_id":"60d0c309cedac4002f8a8537","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1054,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2QFC9GsHmR2YmdKr2K3o2BfM9V6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":703}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
