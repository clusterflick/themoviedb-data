They are in danger, but Lucia refuses to betray her love. A ring falls to the floor, the nightmare begins – the nocturnal sky fills with lightning and thunder, madness and blood reign, there is a corpse, then another and yet another.  Staatsoper Hamburg's Lucia di Lammermoor turns the city into a stage. Inspired by worldwide women's protests, director Amelie Niermeyer has filmed dancers in the city and invites them into the theatre via video. They rush to the aid of the main character Lucia, who - like the director - asserts herself as a woman in a man's world.","popularity":0.0919,"poster_path":"/kio0LerOZSjfWSDJ6QMESzNTXqI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucia di Lammermoor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2113062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Pohl","original_name":"Christoph Pohl","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"60cf1a3c7a3c520078e7dd61","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Venera Gimadieva","original_name":"Venera Gimadieva","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/dl9ZP5LwXC0zlOhQuTgeGHnFenD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"60cf1a429f51af00290c0806","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1437953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Demuro","original_name":"Francesco Demuro","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/s3Hx5MaGA02CHE7oN7ikPfJOZF0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"60cf1a4a7a3c520058dc69f6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3130542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beomjin Kim","original_name":"Beomjin Kim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"60cf1a500a94d4005782ada3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2935371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Roslavets","original_name":"Alexander Roslavets","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"60cf1a57967cc7005842e48e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3130543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katja Pieweck","original_name":"Katja Pieweck","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"60cf1a5ed399e6002a7c0de8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2955288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Kluge","original_name":"Daniel Kluge","popularity":0.0486,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"60cf1a6543d9b10057a44cf1","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2281202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amélie Niermeyer","original_name":"Amélie Niermeyer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cf1a7ed43f01006f3bb6bd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2463679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giampaolo Bisanti","original_name":"Giampaolo Bisanti","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cf1a72d43f01004046061e","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kio0LerOZSjfWSDJ6QMESzNTXqI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
