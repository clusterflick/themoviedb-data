NOTHING I WANTED TO SAY is a feature film shot indoors during the confinement of the 2020 pandemic.

A reflection on isolation during the Covid-19 quarantine and on reconnecting with one's inner self.","popularity":0.2476,"poster_path":"/zZcm0YIZOIUnaUxnaWJb0va74GB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122465,"logo_path":null,"name":"DGT
