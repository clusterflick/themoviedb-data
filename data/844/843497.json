I built the scene in a game engine, and captured the events taking place there with virtual cameras. It is a collage of forms and functions, with textures and animations applied incorrectly. This material was obtained from public domain libraries, low budget game asset stores and preset banks. Mythological shapes show up in a haphazard and contextless way, mirroring the image flow of the internet era and the mental processes involved when making meaning of the world.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qsNEJtPbEMbPdW9BJYI0y2fC76N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ramblings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3131958,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tina Willgren","original_name":"Tina Willgren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d0d3af957e6d0046f9c5db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qsNEJtPbEMbPdW9BJYI0y2fC76N.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mfdEhJ1tckOqfKdbdoImVl7wrrk.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
