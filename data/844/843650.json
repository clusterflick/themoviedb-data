How to research the theme woman and all the themes that surround it, respecting the place of speech of each one? Based on an interview with eighteen women cultural makers from the interior of São Paulo, we open the way to listening and dialogue on macro-themes permeated by their trajectories. The stories are theirs, but they're ours. Expand the debate about being a woman, about feminism and about our pains and delights, about our contradictions and dreams. The documentary is then a research, an open process of listening, reinterpreting and giving voice to them.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/o0P0ykKyiIp3eSGDBf8UTMNsvcx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2021-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"dElas","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3138678,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Daniela Honório","original_name":"Daniela Honório","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8bff9aa78980045214761","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3132298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolina Capelli","original_name":"Carolina Capelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8bf92df86a80046d875f5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3132298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolina Capelli","original_name":"Carolina Capelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8bf86b7fbbd008098020e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3138676,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Milena Aurea","original_name":"Milena Aurea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8bfccd11e0e005fa85e4b","department":"Camera","job":"Still Photographer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3138677,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fernanda Barban","original_name":"Fernanda Barban","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8bfdaaa7898005d562e46","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3138674,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Guilherme Di Curzio","original_name":"Guilherme Di Curzio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8bfe966a7c3002f166626","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3138674,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Guilherme Di Curzio","original_name":"Guilherme Di Curzio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8bfa3b7fbbd005ef2883b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3138675,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Juliano Parreira","original_name":"Juliano Parreira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8bfb9a1c59d0045076f15","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3138674,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Guilherme Di Curzio","original_name":"Guilherme Di Curzio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d8bfab50733c004599bcda","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3132298,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolina Capelli","original_name":"Carolina Capelli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d12eff5b4fed002d210049","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":721,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5CZxukjZxV4SaIrIeZLQBENjizd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/o0P0ykKyiIp3eSGDBf8UTMNsvcx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"14","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"Mostra Delas 2021","release_date":"2021-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"dELAS - Trailer","key":"W-nVGjjRsMU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-03-14T23:55:30.000Z","id":"60d8bf3daa78980029d475bb"}]}}}
