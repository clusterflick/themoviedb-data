The Widow is an exploration of guilt, of obligation, and of the toll of caring for another.","popularity":0.3316,"poster_path":"/nNBReyuTXwPbu1by0gOG8E6JSJM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101494,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soundfirm","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2015-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Widow","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":79711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maggie Dence","original_name":"Maggie Dence","popularity":0.1524,"profile_path":"/cq8NoaaMvg0alruNMWr9GHF0Doa.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Elaine","credit_id":"60cff087fcf907002bbc5863","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":79090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Llewellyn-Jones","original_name":"Tony Llewellyn-Jones","popularity":0.1837,"profile_path":"/hYXF3qQTpKA4j0GbNO9qGMN27We.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Edward","credit_id":"60cff090b458b8006d05a030","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1539455,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Tania Lambert","original_name":"Tania Lambert","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cfeff87a3c52002a409e14","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3131402,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Marlena Ianni","original_name":"Marlena Ianni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cff010629b2c00409d9938","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2770898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katie Found","original_name":"Katie Found","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/mzvIwyLzmKO7LdroUGy7ZahH3nZ.jpg","credit_id":"60cfefc2cede690041be12e5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2599821,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ruby Mathers","original_name":"Ruby Mathers","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/vQ9XSx1Z0XYwnlQnpyu2agXR4ZG.jpg","credit_id":"60cff01ed11e0e0058a48285","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3131400,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katarina Mandic","original_name":"Katarina Mandic","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cfefea0021340057a40318","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1812061,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Diego Ruiz","original_name":"Diego Ruiz","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cff05cb458b8004027713f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2770898,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katie Found","original_name":"Katie Found","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/mzvIwyLzmKO7LdroUGy7ZahH3nZ.jpg","credit_id":"60cfefcc10dad6002a889d4b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638048,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Helen Grimley","original_name":"Helen Grimley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cff06ff263ba00293f9224","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3131403,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Melanie Liertz","original_name":"Melanie Liertz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60cff047002134006e626717","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4251130","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.713,"height":769,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nNBReyuTXwPbu1by0gOG8E6JSJM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":548}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vimeo ","release_date":"2017-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Widow // Teaser Trailer","key":"123921398","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2015-04-02T07:43:21.000Z","id":"60cff110967cc70058442323"}]}}}
