He tries to fill this void by drawing and hanging expressive drawings on the walls around him, but there is no one to see the boy's work. And although his room is packed with colorful gift boxes, the only color Adham knows is black. After all, gifts are not what he asks for.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broken Root","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3132156,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Asim Tareq","original_name":"Asim Tareq","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d1092f127778005f46d63e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3132157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Elzayat","original_name":"Sarah Elzayat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d10939bf31f20046734a98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
