The camera is mounted on the bow of a ship ploughing forward through a squall, and as the boat lurches up and down, the image does too - meaning that the viewer experiences the (unpleasant) sensation of movement too. The canny composition means that the frame contains both the ship and the waves, each moving in different directions.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/3mqqI7FxH2U6iisfpK8F7skafK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19681,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warwick Trading Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1898-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ship at Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3mqqI7FxH2U6iisfpK8F7skafK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1898-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
