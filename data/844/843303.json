Based on footage collected over a two year period, the film explores the inner and outer consciousness of the child and develops the nature of her fantasy life in abstract terms. Although the film deals with the reality of her world as shown by the documentation of sensitive relationships with her animals, it supercedes reality by creating its own rhythms and new images. Her joy and moodiness are contrasted by the superimpositions of color and black and white footage; and we are also aware of the subtle changes that have begun to take place as she matures. The free spirit of the child is revealed by the sound track based on recordings of her favorite music box layered over her interpretive zither playing and the reciting of Andrea's original poetry.\" - RS","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/uNraIbanxtmtiH1xOQhgBRj7Q0G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Andrea Acting Out","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2482456,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosalind Schneider","original_name":"Rosalind Schneider","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d008149f51af00290d9782","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":817,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uNraIbanxtmtiH1xOQhgBRj7Q0G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":545}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
