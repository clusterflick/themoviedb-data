Today's star is Tuti, a 16 year old street girl who dreams of being an actress. Itzik told her that she's going to be a star of a movie just about her, and she couldn't refuse. During the shooting Tuti doesn't understand what kind of a movie Itzik is making. She stands in his room, and he asks her to talk about herself. \"It's like a picture with time\" he tells her again and again. Slowly Itzik's questions become more and more invasive, and Tuti is starting to feel uncomfortable. She wants to leave, but Itzik is convincing her to stay while he shoots both of them. \"You see, now I'm also in the movie\" he tells her and ask if she wants to make a scene of the two of them.","popularity":0.0649,"poster_path":"/f2jfhstMfT1dLXx3HQhoQcRTNpq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21920,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Steve Tisch Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2017-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Film About Allis by Itzik Zaza","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1558513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tuti Ninio","original_name":"Tuti Ninio","popularity":0.1125,"profile_path":"/5xqSS0eGwo7iWSAHPAG1YMiSEQB.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Tuti","credit_id":"60d28ec88d1b8e002cc5c305","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3133489,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Itzik Zaza","original_name":"Itzik Zaza","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Itzik","credit_id":"60d28ed20a517c0023d45ed7","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2372142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Omri Loukas","original_name":"Gabriel Omri Loukas","popularity":0.1186,"profile_path":"/eFBJEmsgqbpzpYW4sN1fnU228Zr.jpg","credit_id":"60d28e8d95c0af004625f0a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3133489,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Itzik Zaza","original_name":"Itzik Zaza","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d28ebca27502002fc1400b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2372142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Omri Loukas","original_name":"Gabriel Omri Loukas","popularity":0.1186,"profile_path":"/eFBJEmsgqbpzpYW4sN1fnU228Zr.jpg","credit_id":"60d28e9943cd5400461b2303","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2372142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Omri Loukas","original_name":"Gabriel Omri Loukas","popularity":0.1186,"profile_path":"/eFBJEmsgqbpzpYW4sN1fnU228Zr.jpg","credit_id":"60d28ea4957e6d0046ffad7f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2372142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Omri Loukas","original_name":"Gabriel Omri Loukas","popularity":0.1186,"profile_path":"/eFBJEmsgqbpzpYW4sN1fnU228Zr.jpg","credit_id":"60d28e94e54d5d002ebe5136","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yonatan Kohavi","original_name":"Yonatan Kohavi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d28eaf0a517c005c820d92","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2372142,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Omri Loukas","original_name":"Gabriel Omri Loukas","popularity":0.1186,"profile_path":"/eFBJEmsgqbpzpYW4sN1fnU228Zr.jpg","credit_id":"60d28e9fbf31f2007ee1255d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8820356","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/f2jfhstMfT1dLXx3HQhoQcRTNpq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1414}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
