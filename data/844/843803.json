Animation director Yevgeny Fadeev joked, and curator Nadezhda Svirskaya took up the organization: in social networks, the reception of 5-second cartoons was announced, which anyone could send, regardless of their professional level. The initiators expected that the entire program would consist of a couple of minutes, because the open call lasted only a week, but almost 150 films were sent, including from abroad.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shcha, 5 sec - 4","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
