The narrator moves through issues of sex work, queer and feminine identity, class, immigration, consumerism, global health and quality of life. The dense narration is juxtaposed against a voyeuristic, bird’s eye view of a female bondage model struggling to be free from the ropes that bind her. Originally shot on black and white Super 8 film, this four and a half minute video invites its audience to question ourselves and the world we live in.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lxYNH4JzKoCmJ3ISa14TiYF2jDO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What's My Mother Fucking Name","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amber Dawn","original_name":"Amber Dawn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"60d28d76bf31f2007ee11ef7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amber Dawn","original_name":"Amber Dawn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d28d80a27502002fc139e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3071403,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amber Dawn","original_name":"Amber Dawn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60d28d89229ae2005e45b802","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lxYNH4JzKoCmJ3ISa14TiYF2jDO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
