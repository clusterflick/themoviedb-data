In Other People's Mirrors, the camera feels like an extension of the unstable characters it is following, taking on a near-home-movie style documentation of street performance and improvised art. It centers around the journey of Echo Transgression, a schizophrenic sex addict, who believes that if she follows the instructions being transmitted directly into her spine, then she will escape to her own version of nirvana. Underground legend Nick Zedd plays the alien phantom of Narcissus, a secret agent who makes sure she stays on course.","popularity":0.3804,"poster_path":"/2oInxjgD4BrnESITTl7KnMy8mNT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124490,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artvamp","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Other People's Mirrors","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3132404,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Echo Transgression","original_name":"Echo Transgression","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Echo","credit_id":"60d16197957e6d0073117aa1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106242,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nick Zedd","original_name":"Nick Zedd","popularity":0.2718,"profile_path":"/oHPbS8HBYCuwyqwcE6KF69qIlSE.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"the alien spirit of Narcissus","credit_id":"60d1619c95c0af005e29844a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3132406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Zuravel","original_name":"Vladimir Zuravel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Vladimir","credit_id":"60d161af4c2592005ecc74a0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3132407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ida Mae Rose","original_name":"Ida Mae Rose","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Melanie","credit_id":"60d161b4bf31f2004674b5e8","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3132408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cary Yets","original_name":"Cary Yets","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Just A.
