In this propagandistic documentary, the director juxtaposes images of class hierarchy and conflict in the West, with images of a flourishing East.","popularity":0.2497,"poster_path":"/rOTxJlPwe1V37cl2y41XSKutPeN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1963-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brüder und Schwestern","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herwart Grosse","original_name":"Herwart Grosse","popularity":0.1385,"profile_path":"/yYswUhmN6uJsIKB6ctDja6sHPPQ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"64642af79f37b0011e498157","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1318975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gisela May","original_name":"Gisela May","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":"/7P9NFfcStOA0hyUrrEir3zSMYqS.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"64642b0344a4240124de3992","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Heynowski","original_name":"Walter Heynowski","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":"/s87fL6oRJrX6kf5XIqNG3qM4poN.jpg","credit_id":"64642ab644a4240187778a4d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1572083,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Hans-Eberhard Leupold","original_name":"Hans-Eberhard Leupold","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64642abdf48b34011b6124e2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Walter Heynowski","original_name":"Walter Heynowski","popularity":0.0668,"profile_path":"/s87fL6oRJrX6kf5XIqNG3qM4poN.jpg","credit_id":"64642ab29f37b0017d57dca9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1505049,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Horst Donth","original_name":"Horst Donth","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64642aca44a4240124de3930","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2066487,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Inge Dochow","original_name":"Inge Dochow","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64642ad2f48b3400e3c0168a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1809241,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gerhard Münch","original_name":"Gerhard Münch","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64642ac376eecf015cba0d38","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2774487,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Barbara Lehmann","original_name":"Barbara Lehmann","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64642adaf48b3401384b6c82","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2968769,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hans-Jürgen Mittag","original_name":"Hans-Jürgen Mittag","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64642ae20284200136382842","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2357800,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean Kurt Forest","original_name":"Jean Kurt Forest","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64642aea02842000fcbddd60","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12874150","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rOTxJlPwe1V37cl2y41XSKutPeN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":523}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1963-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
