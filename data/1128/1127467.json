Craighead’s truly original art spans time and distance and tradition to combine imagery from Catholicism, Native American shamanism, and ancient mythology. Add to the mix her own dreams and mystic visions and the result is a unique synthesis of energy, color, and connectedness.  Through this new documentary, more people will be able to meet this extraordinary artist who paints from her own inner landscape and encourages a unique way of seeing oneself and one's place in the world.","popularity":0.1053,"poster_path":"/j0jutfB2Ast1BDnhpyU30V46sOe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":200193,"logo_path":null,"name":"Minnow Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meinrad Craighead: Praying with Images","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4064649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donna Campbell","original_name":"Donna Campbell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6462d0870f36550136a51e0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4064649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donna Campbell","original_name":"Donna Campbell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6462d09eef8b320172d64881","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4064651,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Georgann Eubanks","original_name":"Georgann Eubanks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6462d0abef8b320172d64896","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4064649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donna Campbell","original_name":"Donna Campbell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6462d0c2e3fa2f012446ff85","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4064651,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Georgann Eubanks","original_name":"Georgann Eubanks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6462d0d70f36550153c77258","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4064656,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Amy Kellum","original_name":"Amy Kellum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6462d0e5dbbb420170aa0009","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4064649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donna Campbell","original_name":"Donna Campbell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6462d0fd0f36550153c77281","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4064649,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Donna Campbell","original_name":"Donna Campbell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6462d108ef8b320172d648dd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1543496","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/j0jutfB2Ast1BDnhpyU30V46sOe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2383,"name":"feminism"},{"id":10706,"name":"spirituality"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":317831,"name":"divine feminine"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2009-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Meinrad Craighead: Praying with Images Preview","key":"3868417","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2009-03-26T17:45:25.000Z","id":"6462d1d70f36550153c77358"}]}}}
