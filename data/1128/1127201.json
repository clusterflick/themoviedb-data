Unexpectedly high temperatures for the time of year, doors that slam too loudly, a runny nose that is picked up loudly; these are annoyances that make the life of autistic Kees unbearable. It is thanks to his mother, who supports him unconditionally, that Kees survives in the outside world, which is so threatening to him. Subject to a strict daily rhythm, he makes long journeys every day in the autumn season as a passenger of his own model train.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ejASRKfq8jrmFC8LGYatsk1Bt90.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Plagued by his many fixations and obsessions with, among other things, the weather and sounds, 32-year-old Kees Momma tries to get through everyday life.","title":"Trainman","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27502398","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.696,"height":1437,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ejASRKfq8jrmFC8LGYatsk1Bt90.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
