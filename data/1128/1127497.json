With Yachiyo supervising Siegfeld, she and the five middle schoolers meet with Claudine, Futaba, and Suzu. The play they will be performing is Seisho's popular program \"The Wartime of Farewells\". As it had been previously revived with Kaoruko and Maya in the lead roles, Claudine and Futaba participate with an extraordinary resolve; meanwhile, Suzu gains a keen interest in Siegfeld's newborn raw gems.  Following Regalia, each of them has taken a step forward as a Stage Girl, but Shiro alone remains without a reason to stand on stage. Shiro has been a servant of the Siegfeld family since childhood, and has lived her life solely for Stella's sake, giving everything up for her. However, her reason of being is shaken up once a camaraderie between Stella and Ryoko starts to develop after their revue.","popularity":0.9677,"poster_path":"/teWq1gM2iZVvG8tPO8VBxTUBJZ2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42196,"logo_path":"/nQNmHvcmaT0zk1Rf0TYtLYO5MpI.png","name":"Bushiroad","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2023-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revue
