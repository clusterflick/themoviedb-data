The first is \"doubtful or uncertain\" and the second, \"capable of being understood in two or more possible senses\"","popularity":0.5043,"poster_path":"/oG6HjmGyHgFVKNZBj5UIWYc6Yz5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21363,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harvard Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-01-11","revenue":2000,"runtime":143,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bernstein at Harvard","title":"The Unanswered Question IV : The Delights and Dangers of Ambiguity","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Unanswered Question Volume 4","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9851,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leonard Bernstein","original_name":"Leonard Bernstein","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/gIcYeEYui0CVZ3eDE26iKUeDX6K.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6462fe88dbbb420170aa1ec4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Humphrey Burton","original_name":"Humphrey Burton","popularity":0.0724,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6462fe9b8c44b9780bf947ad","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1834864","wikidata_id":"Q152508","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":983,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eF4j5B6PYpH4rhzXS0GgHHvDvxT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1747}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oG6HjmGyHgFVKNZBj5UIWYc6Yz5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":853}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":2463,"name":"harvard university"},{"id":156181,"name":"lecture"},{"id":220414,"name":"linguistics"},{"id":283297,"name":"music"},{"id":299169,"name":"leonard bernstein"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1976-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Unanswered Question 1973 4 The Delights & Dangers of Ambiguity Bernstein Norton","key":"hwXO3I8ASSg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-04-08T08:02:35.000Z","id":"6462ff4b8c44b97809617e73"}]}}}
