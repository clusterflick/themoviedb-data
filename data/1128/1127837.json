It was, of course, order colonial in defiance of the republican order, in Algeria as in Paris where, on October 17, 1961, Algerians flocking from suburban slums were massacred by the police of prefect Maurice Papon, while they were peacefully marching for the independence of their country. On October 17, 2001, a commemorative plaque was placed in Paris on the Saint-Michel bridge: \"In memory of the many Algerians killed during the bloody repression of the peaceful demonstration of October 17, 1961.\" A surge of racial hatred, less than 20 years after the roundup of the Jews in July 1942. An Algerian, victim of this roundup, told us, holding back his tears, \"I still have nightmares.\"","popularity":0.4665,"poster_path":"/kAneZVYECol1547Xga9fSzuGrok.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":200272,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Méridien Créations","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'ordre Français : 17 Octobre 1961","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4065959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Jacques Beryl","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Beryl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6463dc79e3fa2f00e404e7af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4065959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Jacques Beryl","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Beryl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6463dc8e8c44b9780cf60046","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4065959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Jacques Beryl","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Beryl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6463dca3dbbb420170aa8b92","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4065961,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Richard Sovied","original_name":"Richard Sovied","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6463dcb1a672540143685392","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4065961,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Richard Sovied","original_name":"Richard Sovied","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6463dcbc8c44b9780bf9ba6a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4065959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Jacques Beryl","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Beryl","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6463dcc87e3483011a511ad7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4065963,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ghislain Duval","original_name":"Ghislain Duval","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6463dce08c44b97808fffb64","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4065965,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Barbara Floro Torrisi","original_name":"Barbara Floro Torrisi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6463dd067e348301716abda4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4065966,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pierre-Simon Ottajv","original_name":"Pierre-Simon Ottajv","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6463dd15dbbb4200fc89406d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11399772","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uABE6KOHPuOlUGtmPbGTIAYJ0H4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qipbrzsyUMuBgOHJHMjYRpFxanp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kAneZVYECol1547Xga9fSzuGrok.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/16As53zjkU0MTcrOPZpnklKPClo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10937,"name":"memory"},{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":169449,"name":"algeria"},{"id":187196,"name":"french colonialism"},{"id":213473,"name":"algerian war (1954-62)"},{"id":215036,"name":"state crimes"},{"id":293547,"name":"djazair"},{"id":312898,"name":"violence"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
