The title I Am Borderline, is based off of a campaign created By Betsy Usher and Wright Institute Los Angeles. The campaign's goal is to help reduce the stigma of BPD by asking individuals who identify with the BPD diagnosis to post pictures of themselves showing all of the other talents, labels, and thoughts about who they are. (Ex: I am a teacher). Being diagnosed with BPD does not mean that is all you are, it is only a label.","popularity":0.4737,"poster_path":"/4ZWq5WGdk28Z5me7cS0YpMwhj0g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Borderline","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":165958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff D'Agostino","original_name":"Jeff D'Agostino","popularity":0.2038,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jeff","credit_id":"64626c6d0f36550153c746dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amanda Gardner","original_name":"Amanda Gardner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Dancer","credit_id":"64626c7b8c44b900fc91e6e8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2273984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Allen Goldman","original_name":"Josh Allen Goldman","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/nVccDbCRxtYKHUsk8gP5l04M7ty.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Josh","credit_id":"64626c87ef8b3200fe7e1d3c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":94554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle Keaton","original_name":"Danielle Keaton","popularity":0.4429,"profile_path":"/ygzYXNOOVmsgiDSeO42wl7KvnT2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Danielle","credit_id":"64626c94a672540164df0705","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1240468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucy Walsh","original_name":"Lucy Walsh","popularity":0.115,"profile_path":"/kYHgk69EdbrjAyYWTFxlQodVsuh.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Lucy","credit_id":"64626c9eef8b320138879898","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4063810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Betsy Usher","original_name":"Betsy Usher","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64626cfca672540164df0730","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5596276","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4ZWq5WGdk28Z5me7cS0YpMwhj0g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
