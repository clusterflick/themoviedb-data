So much is unknown about black holes. Things like how they form and what happens when the threshold of an event horizon is crossed remain a mystery. But we do know that the force, energy, and momentum of black holes are inescapable and transformative. Falling in love has an unavoidable gravity much like that of an event horizon. Unpredictable and powerful, how it changes a person is an enigma.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Close Distance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4063426,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colleen Vandenberg","original_name":"Colleen Vandenberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64623cb6a672540164def0c4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
