She has fought for Civil Rights in the 1960s, school integration, prison reform, female healthcare equality, LGBTQ+ rights, HIV/AIDS prevention and support, before the AAPI community would even recognize it. In this film, we follow Suki as she goes from her neighborhood in Harlem where she’s lived for over 87 years to a lunch at her friend’s apartment in downtown. A conversation of action, identity, and belonging emerges between three generations of AAPI activists and storytellers.","popularity":0.0744,"poster_path":"/tWZqoTD1in9zYUDmKVy5LFILE9g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Call Me Suki","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2685607,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jess X.
