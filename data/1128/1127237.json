Two children play without noticing that time advances relentlessly, theirs, the one of the creatures, the one of the earth, and the one of the imagination. This elastic and layered time reveals itself in its traces, marks, and elements, allowing us to learn more about earth and its inhabitants. Five narrators accompany us in this excavation that is intended to be infinite, revealing time and its marks.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Growing Pains – A Film In Seven Parts","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2630283,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isabel Aboim Inglez","original_name":"Isabel Aboim Inglez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64623e2fa6725401010a56eb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
