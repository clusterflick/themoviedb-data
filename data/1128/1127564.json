Weeks later, he resurfaces at a meeting of the Communist Youth where he is denounced for certain \"reprehensible actions\" and excluded from the organization. As a result of the same \"reprehensible\" deeds he is expelled from the school. His schoolmates are never told what his actions actually were. \"Notorious deeds, unworthy of being mentioned,\" is the only comment provided by a high-level communist party representative. Now, 25 years later, those involved are keen to tell their side of the story.","popularity":0.141,"poster_path":"/xWlAzesLcevZvMoSQOAmn7Pr5HV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128559,"logo_path":null,"name":"Commitet","origin_country":""},{"id":200209,"logo_path":null,"name":"Akademie der Bildenden Künste Wien","origin_country":""},{"id":200210,"logo_path":null,"name":"Production Creatives","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2016-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notorious Deeds","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Already known and not worth mentioning","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Bereits bekannt und nicht der Rede wert","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Tempea","original_name":"Gabriel Tempea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6463123d0f365501190758a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Tempea","original_name":"Gabriel Tempea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646312450f36550170b36a64","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1276587,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Barbu Bălășoiu","original_name":"Barbu Bălășoiu","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646312570f36550170b36a71","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2266783,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Claus Benischke","original_name":"Claus Benischke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6463128be3fa2f0187b997e3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2409987,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexandru Munteanu","original_name":"Alexandru Munteanu","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646312a3ef8b32015556163c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1413598,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alex Dragomir","original_name":"Alex Dragomir","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646312dadbbb420119f6151b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1413599,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sebastian Zsemlye","original_name":"Sebastian Zsemlye","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"646312e8dbbb4200e22e1f3c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2808318,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriel Tempea","original_name":"Gabriel Tempea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64631370e3fa2f012447241d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1010184,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Heise","original_name":"Thomas Heise","popularity":0.095,"profile_path":"/xSTn9BmHKwkhdlrn0S3Txas5atc.jpg","credit_id":"64631415ef8b3200e3ae816c","department":"Production","job":"Consulting Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5002448","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xWlAzesLcevZvMoSQOAmn7Pr5HV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ro","note":"Jihlava International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2016-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Faptele sunt cunoscute - Trailer","key":"136605625","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2015-08-18T12:17:20.000Z","id":"6463155fef8b32013887e501"}]}}}
