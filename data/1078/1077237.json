Wuxia, a traditional form of martial arts literature that expanded into 20th century popular film and television, was created out of narratives and characters often from lower social classes that uphold chivalric ideals against oppressive forces during unstable times. The People’s Republic of China placed wuxia under heavy censorship for fear of arousing anti-government sentiment. Retainers of Anarchy is a 25-metre scroll-like video installation that references life during the Song Dynasty (960–1279 CE), but undermines its idealized portraiture of social cohesion by setting the narrative in Kowloon’s notorious walled city—an ungoverned tenement of disenfranchised refugees in Hong Kong which was demolished in 1994.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/onP7dBrLmir9HAPRM7UoewKOxc0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Retainers of Anarchy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3885116,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Howie Tsui","original_name":"Howie Tsui","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cccf63e24b93009edab7e4","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3885120,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Remy Siu","original_name":"Remy Siu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cccfaae24b93009edab80a","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Imaging Science"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3885120,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Remy Siu","original_name":"Remy Siu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cccf99d363e500de0fbd11","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3885124,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Sitji Chou","original_name":"Sitji Chou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cccfc2d363e5008e8f1a44","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3885129,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Kodai Yanagawa","original_name":"Kodai Yanagawa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cccfe0cee48100dee8d3e1","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3885132,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Kerel Alaas","original_name":"Kerel Alaas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cccfefcee48100c1df2b61","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3885126,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Roxanne Zagar","original_name":"Roxanne Zagar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cccfd36d97e60089f06df8","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3885116,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Howie Tsui","original_name":"Howie Tsui","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cccf7009dda4008384c4ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3885134,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Amelia Earhart","original_name":"Amelia Earhart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cccffccee481008efec450","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/onP7dBrLmir9HAPRM7UoewKOxc0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vancouver Art Gallery","release_date":"2017-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Power Plant: Interview with Howie Tsui","key":"KsrwVhAo9rk","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2020-11-10T18:29:39.000Z","id":"63ccd0accee48100c1df2bd1"}]}}}
