Once there, a team kayaked 500km along the spectacular Greenland coast while another team attempted to climb unconquered towering rock-walls.  Among the crew were film maker Claire Riordan and photographer Daragh Muldowney. Between them they captured the range of experiences and emotions encountered by our adventurers; from the harsh realities of life on the North Atlantic in a cramped 49ft yacht, to the heart-achingly beautiful scenery of a landscape under threat; from the vast isolation of the Arctic Circle to feasting with locals on whale blubber, walrus and polar bear stew!","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bSJ5pyitFYHzXPSqE33ghYFZFPR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2014-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Galway to Greenland - North of Disko","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","title":"North of Disko","type":"short title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bSJ5pyitFYHzXPSqE33ghYFZFPR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ga","note":"Premier on Irish language station, TG4","release_date":"2014-12-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ó Ghaillimh go dtí An Ghrianlaoinn – North of Disko","key":"125734377","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2015-04-22T21:10:48.000Z","id":"63cf3e28559d2200da92ecee"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"North of Disko - trailer 2","key":"104114386","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-08-22T15:50:49.000Z","id":"63cf3e9a1b157d00d54912c9"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"North of Disko Trailer","key":"87484859","site":"Vimeo","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-02-24T17:03:31.000Z","id":"63cf3e6d8dbc3300c61d148a"}]}}}
