unfortunately can't pin the official premiere date to the exact month/day, seems like 1998 was the official US festival premiere for it. if anyone has any flyers/photo evidence for these to help find out the exact premiere date, that would be super helpful! i set this as June 12th, '98 for now, since the guidelines mention major professional festivals as qualifying for a movie's release and that's the first day that the Florida Film Festival was held that year; looks to be the first large-scale professional festival this was shown at, where it also won that Kodak
