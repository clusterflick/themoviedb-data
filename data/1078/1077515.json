At first glance, this piece with its stringent composition and seeming calm seems to resemble a photograph. What we see is a cropped section of an angled overhead shot of a young man lying bare chested on a carpet.On closer inspection minimal movements can be discerned within this harmonious composition. These minute movements attest to the fact that he is alive: we intuit his breath and heartbeat from the fact that his chest rises and falls gently, and the artery in his neck pulsates.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/d1yBtZMMGOmcniHRwiK6TOGEb0d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heartbeat/Armpit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3734074,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wolfgang Tillmans","original_name":"Wolfgang Tillmans","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/8ifmEzroxMs4bWhb0zHRi7bQLI5.jpg","credit_id":"63cdc712e24b930081947d36","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1456,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/d1yBtZMMGOmcniHRwiK6TOGEb0d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":971},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1456,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bB4fYpBnFufMjqNDoTMhqCPl2Y2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":971}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":285257,"name":"armpit"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Julia Stoschek Collection (Düsseldorf)","release_date":"2018-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"MoMA – Museum of Modern Art, New York","release_date":"2022-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"David Zwirner Art Gallery","release_date":"2015-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
