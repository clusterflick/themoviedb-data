The videopoem blends minimalist poetry with inquisitive prose and juxtaposes them with the different visual tempo.  Eta Dahlia is a poet and filmmaker based in London. He works with spoken word, video, images, colours and music, integrating these elements into inseparable rhythmic and rhyming compositions to create coherent and complete multimedia poetic pieces. Through these interdisciplinary pieces Eta strives to reach a universal type of poem, where the understanding and appreciation of a piece is not limited to its original language.
