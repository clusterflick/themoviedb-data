Luciano, a tourist guide to the Châ da Caldeiras volcano, will be our guide. He has never left Fogo Island, and confides to us how he needs to get out of there. His daily chores: walk up the volcano, take care of his grapes and feed the cattle. In his spare time he accompanies his father, on the violin, with his Reco-Reco, a plain comb he scrapes a plastic tube with. The trip he invites us to take with him will also be his tour, an initiation journey in the heart of his country and culture.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24731,"logo_path":"/vwQj2DPMJWBlgKC2Ek6h4aOe5AQ.png","name":"Les Films Grain de Sable","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Som & Morabeza","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1623014,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristèle Alves Meira","original_name":"Cristèle Alves Meira","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/xSPXfi4KFvJA9TmacphBCS8JYjm.jpg","credit_id":"63cc479b9a643500ce14ee1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3884344,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Julien Michel","original_name":"Julien Michel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cc544809dda400cfd8c8a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
