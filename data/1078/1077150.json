Although I always had uncertainties and questions about my true belonging to the Mohawk culture and my ties to my community, I've never felt as culturally empty as I do now. Even if I always knew that I was a last generation Indian, I never felt that I needed to justify or explain who I was because my Grand-father was Mohawk, which in turn granted me that right. With his death, my heart and my roots seem to have slipped further away. »  Last Call Indian begins where the life of Morris Bonspille ends.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/4VMFVs8oMYCiUNlIB58wN9hSKJH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Call Indian","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1515819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sonia Bonspille Boileau","original_name":"Sonia Bonspille Boileau","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/6qXeVNYC8RD6pDRLQb2fxefYDIF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63cc832be24b93008193f2d6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3884531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sébastien Boileau","original_name":"Sébastien Boileau","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63cc8340d363e5008e8eed0e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3884533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joan Bonspille","original_name":"Joan Bonspille","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"63cc8349532acb007cc39f9e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3884534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Léona Bonspille","original_name":"Léona Bonspille","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63cc8351cee48100c1defe21","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3884535,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphane Bérubé","original_name":"Stéphane Bérubé","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"63cc835fd363e50079c1c378","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1515819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sonia Bonspille Boileau","original_name":"Sonia Bonspille Boileau","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/6qXeVNYC8RD6pDRLQb2fxefYDIF.jpg","credit_id":"63cc82cbcee4810084d421e6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1515822,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Patrick Kaplin","original_name":"Patrick Kaplin","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cc83e26d97e600add464b2","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1515821,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michel DeMars","original_name":"Michel DeMars","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cc839de24b93009b9cb7a0","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1515823,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Randy Kelly","original_name":"Randy Kelly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cc83bacee48100dee8aa44","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3884538,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Brennan","original_name":"Jason Brennan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cc837a532acb0084de72d9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3884541,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Philippe Racicot","original_name":"Philippe Racicot","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cc83cfd363e5008e8eedb8","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3884539,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Carole Thibeault","original_name":"Carole Thibeault","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cc838ee24b9300cdf901da","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1515819,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sonia Bonspille Boileau","original_name":"Sonia Bonspille Boileau","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/6qXeVNYC8RD6pDRLQb2fxefYDIF.jpg","credit_id":"63cc82bfcee4810084d421d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2392990","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1421,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4VMFVs8oMYCiUNlIB58wN9hSKJH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
