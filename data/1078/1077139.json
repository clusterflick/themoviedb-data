They encounter creatures with names that stimulate the imagination: sea cucumbers, frilled anemones, rough-mantled doris, pink shrimps, and Atlantic wolfish. Jacques Cousteau used to say that “people protect what they love, and they love what they know.” By uncovering the beauty and the richness of the depths of the St. Lawrence, Geneviève and Patrick hope to encourage people to come to love it… and protect it.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":"/5SaY5mtS9ib1OBcI4vP2fzkhzlZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deep Québec","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3884491,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Geneviève Bilodeau","original_name":"Geneviève Bilodeau","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cc6e889a643500872aea9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1993109,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Isabelle Couture","original_name":"Isabelle Couture","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/hpjSwGmHDxZQRRkV6rqzVfm6AoT.jpg","credit_id":"63cc6ebe09dda4007a6c8d93","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3884491,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Geneviève Bilodeau","original_name":"Geneviève Bilodeau","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cc6e8fd363e50079c1b83c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1993110,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Katarina Soukup","original_name":"Katarina Soukup","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cc6ed9e24b9300cdf8f61f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2478717,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Patrick R.
