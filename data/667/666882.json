Although continually threatened by development the area stayed intact largely due to being ensnared between two railroad tracks.  Murmur is a collaboration between filmmaker Jan Locus and sound artist Stijn Demeulenaere. Just before first light, they recorded the dawn chorus. The city drone permeates the sound of the swamp, and a strange mix enfolds between the sound of an awakening nature and a human presence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/hGk1JOonnGIVu3Y1MqNFVsV19X1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murmur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2396953,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jan Locus","original_name":"Jan Locus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2c5cdc1685da0011e6d2df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2520243,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stijn Demeulenaere","original_name":"Stijn Demeulenaere","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2c5cf197eab40015ad348f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hGk1JOonnGIVu3Y1MqNFVsV19X1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"IFFR 2020","release_date":"2020-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Murmur (excerpt)","key":"353743321","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2019-08-14T08:45:28.000Z","id":"5e2c5c81c2823a001597a42e"}]}}}
