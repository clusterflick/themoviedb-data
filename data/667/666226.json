Yet this place, which remains largely as it was when dinosaurs roamed the planet, is currently at the mercy of destructive extraction industries, including logging and mining. Weaving together the conflicting narratives of activists, locals and Aboriginal communities, and told through the experiences of a trail running doctor and a relentless environmentalist, this documentary, presented by Patagonia Films, unpacks the complexities of modern conservation and challenges us to consider the importance of our last truly wild places.","popularity":1.477,"poster_path":"/iThxHFKDrTKuUvBsDBqGWJeYfOa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148014,"logo_path":"/sh5M67BZcLtrMkyX6sXTcg4ci2z.png","name":"Patagonia","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What if running could save a rainforest?","title":"Takayna","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1408909,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alex Lowther","original_name":"Alex Lowther","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e28b9d29638640011aab610","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"PATAGONIA","instagram_id":"patagonia","twitter_id":"patagonia"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.562,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iThxHFKDrTKuUvBsDBqGWJeYfOa.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5657,"name":"australia"},{"id":180550,"name":"rainforest"},{"id":194161,"name":"tasmania"},{"id":209560,"name":"aboriginal"},{"id":261310,"name":"takayna"},{"id":261311,"name":"tarkine"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Takayna - Trailer","key":"hZPBZ46ov0s","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-05-09T15:15:08.000Z","id":"5e28bbe14ca676001a41d44b"}]}}}
