Mogul skiing has become a very popular event at the Olympics, but beyond the fact that competitors ski down some bumps and do a couple jumps, spectators don’t really understand. Bumps, directed by Canadian National Team member and filmmaker Zac Hoffman, fills this gap.  The sport has yet to be shown to the public in a way that does it justice. A mogul run is exciting to watch, but once someone knows what goes into being able to make it down that course, it becomes so much more. It’s a display of strength, intensity, finesse, strategy, individuality, and mental fortitude.","popularity":0.2796,"poster_path":"/ftSWExXpoGefzwE2o5aK5PhApDM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-02","revenue":5600,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bumps: A Mogul Skiing Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Bumps","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bumps","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2518083,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zac Hoffman","original_name":"Zac Hoffman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e28b1ae98f1f10012f4b757","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9E0AALmXRrlJQHpHfGW19DrLjA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.629,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ftSWExXpoGefzwE2o5aK5PhApDM.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":755}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":248915,"name":"skiing"},{"id":261309,"name":"mogul skiing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2014-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2015-12-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
