It is 1987. The dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos has just been overthrown. Newly elected President Corazon Aquino struggles to wrench control of the country from her own military. A Rustling of Leaves poses the key question facing the revolutionaries and the Filipino Left: Should the People’s Movement continue the guerilla war, or do they dare enter legal politics and reveal the hidden face of the revolution?","popularity":0.2532,"poster_path":"/iEviraFjtZbwEnt1QdalFticOJ0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129002,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kalasikas
