Friends Gregor Möller, Philip Kist and Anne Lewald visit in 2013 and 2017 and do what is strictly forbidden and for which they might have ended up in a forced labor camp: even though accompanied by state watchers, they secretly film their travels, accompanied by state watchdogs. We get an extraordinary insight into one of the most closed societies in the world and experience the 'beautiful new world' as the state propaganda machinery displays it.","popularity":0.2262,"poster_path":"/4rxPiMPHWM3FKGXOgND4xWLwhRI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Postcard from Pyongyang","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"A Postcard from Pyongyang - Traveling through North Korea","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"헬로우 평양","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Hel-low-pyong-yang","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Cartolina da Pyongyang","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2519067,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anne Lewald","original_name":"Anne Lewald","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2a856a4ca6760017455d7e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2519066,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gregor Möllers","original_name":"Gregor Möllers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2a85571685da0019e3d6a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11429372","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oDt7Sj1Na3Yas2J9EjaDA94BIK1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4rxPiMPHWM3FKGXOgND4xWLwhRI.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/b5fBI5JpmGkRavuPEhaoeuKBW6H.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.702,"height":1913,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/mzcILBQYWHdywbCkOwqifDYXVkl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1343},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sRA9jKW6rUQT6aXfJEtnakn7LYm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9935,"name":"travel"},{"id":261734,"name":"north korea"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Florence Korea Film Fest","release_date":"2020-09-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2019-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A POSTCARD FROM PYONGYANG - TRAVELING THROUGH NORTH KOREA (Official Trailer)","key":"310568934","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-01-10T14:24:40.000Z","id":"5f6da123325a5100356e06b7"}]}}}
