Hearing about the death of his uncle Ganondorf, Adikin assembles an army to seek out Link. Will our lost hero stop Hyrule's new threat?  The Legend of Young Link is a fan film from 2008 inspired from The \"Legend of Zelda\" series and a fan film called \"Legend of Link\" by Obsession Studios. It was made purely for fun and no other reason. All the actors were friends of mine who also shared a love for Zelda. This is the first time this movie is being presented in full length.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/yrQND6gHrjHRJMBe5KZ4YPKJMSj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two years after Ganondorf is defeated, Ganondorf's nephew Adikin seeks vengeance on Link.","title":"The Legend of Young Link","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yrQND6gHrjHRJMBe5KZ4YPKJMSj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
