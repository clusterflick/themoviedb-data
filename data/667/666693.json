A sequence of images edited on camera with a posteriori sound intervention. Cinescape opens windows through the bars. Its title invites the viewer to let go, be taken away by the lens-shot. A double move in which a shot makes the world its prey and releases it again in the projection: a game of light and shadow. Cinescape is an invented compound word Cine (cinema) + escape. At the same time, phonetically it sounds exactly the same as “sin escape”, which means no or without escape. Sound intervention: ROM (Roberto Etcheverry & Omar Grandoso).","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinescape","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2519390,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Macarena Cordiviola","original_name":"Macarena Cordiviola","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2b360d98f1f1000ff8e124","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
