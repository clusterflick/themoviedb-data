The idea was to edit all the curtains shots he ever made in strictly chronological order – as a pars pro toto representation of his oeuvre and philosophy of cinema.  With Love – Volume One 1987-1996 developed from this project. How close it is to the original intentions behind Curtains, only Pilz can say. But considering that Pilz's whole life and art is about self-development, discovery and realisation, every film he makes is in its own way another sum total. Each film is a debut as well as a cenotaph for what was so far; in loving memory, for a morrow of love. This development demands encounters with other people; that's the only way to grow. Come along and meet Pilz − and yourself.","popularity":0.0452,"poster_path":"/rhi5eEdV0SSP5j3meLrTjpXxjI4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136367,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Pilz Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2020-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"With Love – Volume One 1987-1996","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","title":"Curtains","type":"Working Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Pilz","original_name":"Michael Pilz","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/pqAgRCqueTPDi8ck9nh3hKCj2jO.jpg","credit_id":"5e29266898f1f10012f55cc9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Pilz","original_name":"Michael Pilz","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/pqAgRCqueTPDi8ck9nh3hKCj2jO.jpg","credit_id":"5f1029d42a210c0036ee46e2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Pilz","original_name":"Michael Pilz","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/pqAgRCqueTPDi8ck9nh3hKCj2jO.jpg","credit_id":"5f1029c12495ab0034357e54","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1382121,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Pilz","original_name":"Michael Pilz","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/pqAgRCqueTPDi8ck9nh3hKCj2jO.jpg","credit_id":"5f1029b52a210c0035ee09f7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1127,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rhi5eEdV0SSP5j3meLrTjpXxjI4.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":751},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vnKh6FtSweDyXnHG2B6t8cctGo8.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Festival Ecrã","release_date":"2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
