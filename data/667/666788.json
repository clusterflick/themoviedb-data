After filming finished in 1944, these extras were sent to Auschwitz. Nina Gladitz interviews the survivors and perpetrators, wondering if Riefenstahl knew this would happen at the end of production.  Tiefland was filmed from 1940-1944 but was not released until 1954. Leni Riefenstahl sued Gladitz over the documentary.","popularity":0.1339,"poster_path":"/eB5cLJ0EZDXVa7jMjuJ49aC7Kyj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":153252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nina Gladitz Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1982-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time of Darkness and Silence","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2519830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Reinhardt","original_name":"Josef Reinhardt","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e2bb2df4ca676001445f3eb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leni Riefenstahl","original_name":"Leni Riefenstahl","popularity":0.1769,"profile_path":"/rxD6oG0TCQm1ASARgi0eKB3QQt9.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5e2bb506688cd0001bc7f0b3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2519828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Gladitz","original_name":"Nina Gladitz","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60857a8833a533002aff6e99","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2519828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Gladitz","original_name":"Nina Gladitz","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60857a98960cde002a862682","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2519828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Gladitz","original_name":"Nina Gladitz","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60857a788c44b9003fed7ac6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3066928,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gerhard Dietrich","original_name":"Gerhard Dietrich","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60857ace8d22fc0058bee5f4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2519828,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Gladitz","original_name":"Nina Gladitz","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e2bb28fc2823a001796e0dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1027205","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lmvcDsmZmNveiR0CLVsmcJxzTT6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eB5cLJ0EZDXVa7jMjuJ49aC7Kyj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/b6BJ6Kje7l0FiCY2dGllREsq2N5.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1182,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sl1GUklQq9WxlyAIOBfS7stttOv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":788},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/wuwN45XaN2WMQzuioCXvU8jbDXq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"Westdeutsche Rundfunk","release_date":"1982-09-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
