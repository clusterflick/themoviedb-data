Personal physician to Queen Victoria, also physician to the Swedish royal family (he spent his last years living in the Royal Palace in Sweden), \"Axel Munthe\" knew everyone from the poorest clients to the most well-endowed. His love of animals, his support of bird sanctuaries, his involvement with architecture as he constructs his impressive villa throughout five summers, and his interests in archaeology and hypnotism are all explored.","popularity":0.5192,"poster_path":"/5EjDyIgvBg2D7aH89dcQrH7Kv1G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1787,"logo_path":"/tWdfCS6OBkxSuXao5lluNKDIvlc.png","name":"CCC Filmkunst","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1962-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Story of San Michele","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le livre de San Michele","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"O.W.
