This did not make foreigners of any stripe very popular, and those from \"guest worker\" countries were particularly disliked. In this film, set in 1938, a half-Polish boy goes to Poland in search of his mother, runs into financial and psychological difficulties there, and is sent back to a Swedish mental hospital. In another story, an unfortunate woman suffers a miscarriage and ends up at the asylum where the Polish boy is being kept.","popularity":0.4883,"poster_path":"/avB0MFZFVLBtvXSLH2unahYJBay.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7834,"logo_path":null,"name":"Treklövern","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska
