Despite Arthur's entreaties to Merlin to let him become his apprentice, Merlin insists that there are more important things in store for him. When Merlin nominates Cynthia as his new apprentice, Arthur leaves in search of his destiny. Soon after, he is captured by the evil Sir Baldrick and left in a dungeon to be devoured by a dragon. Fortunately, Cynthia, using her magic powers and guile, frees Arthur in time for him to go to Stonehenge and compete with the Knights of the Realm who try to pull the sword from the stone to become King. Of course, Arthur easily removes the sword and is crowned the new King.","popularity":0.3488,"poster_path":"/pZ5RuGpXVdAE33GazuwusccBosF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65288,"logo_path":"/iXd0oGOIsFTL4kKz0knYT2VMuMJ.png","name":"Burbank Animation Studios","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1998-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Camelot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224175,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alistair Duncan","original_name":"Alistair Duncan","popularity":0.104,"profile_path":"/y9Ua8C3JxBinwvBKmZY2BMmjKC7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c78a8959251412a4f47472d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1128161,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robyn Moore","original_name":"Robyn Moore","popularity":0.1661,"profile_path":"/sHxhBQDmZFDoVdNJdUHmdwhd8Sx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c78a89f0e0a2611da0e76c0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1445417,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Perry","original_name":"Lee Perry","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":"/zMpLa0qU9ByTvHxmkNyLLKIyH0I.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c78a8a79251412a5d474832","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1070139,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roz Phillips","original_name":"Roz Phillips","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6256cd384cd91200500a5ad5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1070139,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roz Phillips","original_name":"Roz Phillips","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6256cd45323eba0dc6d71d37","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1975867,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Turner","original_name":"Steve Turner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6256ced62efe4e0e4f9b5ec6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1064880,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Leadon","original_name":"Paul Leadon","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6256cd3d0e4419009c934179","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1070165,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Roddy Lee","original_name":"Roddy Lee","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6256cf064cd91200500a63bf","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1071392,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David C.
