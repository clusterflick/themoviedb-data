Two Inuit men in Canadaâ€™s Far North choose the site, cut and place snow blocks and create an entrance--a shelter completed in one-and-a-half hours. The commentary explains that the interior warmth and the wind outside cement the snow blocks firmly together. As the short winter day darkens, the two builders move their caribou sleeping robes and extra skins indoors, confident of spending a snug night in the midst of the Arctic cold!","popularity":0.5251,"poster_path":"/8HqkuZuwNJXx8rmwXmZ2yVOkWR4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1949-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Build an Igloo","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Arctic Notebook No. 1: How to Build an Igloo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1308354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Wilkinson","original_name":"Douglas Wilkinson","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f3a3385f2b8d00fef3d3db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1308354,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Wilkinson","original_name":"Douglas Wilkinson","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534568b30e0a267bd4001e14","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1308355,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael Spencer","original_name":"Michael Spencer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534568da0e0a267bc6001d25","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1308356,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Chester C.
