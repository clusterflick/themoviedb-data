Central to this work is the complex emotions surrounding love, separation, and the metonymic twinning of objects, including that of edited images and saturated sound.  “AMOR is an exquisite lyric, shot in Rome and at the natural theatre of Salzburg. The recurring sounds of cutting cloth, hands clapping, hammering, and tapping underline the associations of the montage of short camera movements, which bring together the making of a suit, the restoration of a building, and details of a figure, presumably Beavers himself, standing in the natural theatre in a new suit, making a series of hand movements and gestures. A handsomely designed Italian banknote suggests the aesthetic economy of the film: the tailoring, trimming, and chiselling point to the editing of the film itself.”  (P. Adams Sitney, Film Comment).","popularity":0.1727,"poster_path":"/a1eO5sHwxsdtnPnhCMhUdbJCDeP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amor","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Beavers","original_name":"Robert Beavers","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":"/2bYi9uNjaUBwjxFufd67XAZjbqz.jpg","credit_id":"5344d310c3a3682598000df4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0300935","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":875,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8amBYQl75osvcLtH1nLD5IYzZ6Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1556}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a1eO5sHwxsdtnPnhCMhUdbJCDeP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Österreichisches Filmmuseum, Vienna","release_date":"1980-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Toronto Film Festival","release_date":"2000-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
