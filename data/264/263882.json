The older woman ceremoniously lays a table â€“ she repeatedly spreads a cloth and smoothes it out. The table is set and glasses and jug filled with water. A balanced and controlled ritual follows in which the jug is passed round and water is repeatedly sipped. Water becomes the lens through which we see and the medium through which the protagonists connect. The sense of connectivity is abruptly severed when the first glass tumbles.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1996-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mirrored Measure","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2397940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Stephens","original_name":"Kate Stephens","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5d666882ba48020012273616","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2397942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Pucill","original_name":"Jane Pucill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5d6668a9b3e6270018fe62f2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Pucill","original_name":"Sarah Pucill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534552b30e0a267bcd001b91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1422559,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandra Lahire","original_name":"Sandra Lahire","popularity":0.0653,"profile_path":"/nHbLQ3Gy3jILGTsld6L4k4dKXa4.jpg","credit_id":"5d6668d3b3e6276090fe376d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Pucill","original_name":"Sarah Pucill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d6668f0ba4802001327349f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Pucill","original_name":"Sarah Pucill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d66690ab3e6276e56fe3767","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Pucill","original_name":"Sarah Pucill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d66691f58361b4ec5214807","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2397940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Stephens","original_name":"Kate Stephens","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d666afdb3e6270018fe658e","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2397940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Stephens","original_name":"Kate Stephens","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d666b1458361b0011221c89","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Pucill","original_name":"Sarah Pucill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d666b1f58361b0011221c8c","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Pucill","original_name":"Sarah Pucill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d666b39b3e6270018fe65b9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Pandemonium Moving Image Art Festival, ICA, London","release_date":"1996-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
