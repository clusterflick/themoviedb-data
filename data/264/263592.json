He remains connected to Berlin with every fiber of his being; the city’s culture, its essence, and as far as he’s concerned, Israel is no more than a pit stop. He gradually pulls away from his wife, his son who does not get him, his sisters who are haunted by the past, and the rental flat where he’s lived all these years. He sets up shop in a budget hotel by the Tel Aviv seaside, hangs out with a group of fringe misfits, and dreams of moving back to Berlin.","popularity":0.1279,"poster_path":"/9Z7GOjmalBG38hTfcBrjJucMiZt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1980-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transit","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1443413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fitcho Ben-Zur","original_name":"Fitcho Ben-Zur","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"63cd580dd363e50086d38789","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1433578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gedalia Besser","original_name":"Gedalia Besser","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"551d5043c3a3683a140001e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1448785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yair Elazar","original_name":"Yair Elazar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"551d504c925141374c0001c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruth Geller","original_name":"Ruth Geller","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"63cd58319a643500ae03a6c3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1156765,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fanny Lubitsch","original_name":"Fanny Lubitsch","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"63cd5838e24b9300896765b6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2929688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gita Luka","original_name":"Gita Luka","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"63cd583ee24b93008194570d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1301951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amnon Moskin","original_name":"Amnon Moskin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"63cd58459a643500ae03a6cc","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1320129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liora Rivlin","original_name":"Liora Rivlin","popularity":0.0993,"profile_path":"/jVUKLuD6RrHk9mpgQRNXxZH9eif.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"63cd584ce24b93009edaefb2","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1936460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Talia Shapira","original_name":"Talia Shapira","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"63cd5854cee48100c1df610c","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2187666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moti Shirin","original_name":"Moti Shirin","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"63cd585b9a643500872b543a","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584574,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gideon Singer","original_name":"Gideon Singer","popularity":0.1354,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"63cd586209dda400cfd9375d","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Wachsmann","original_name":"Daniel Wachsmann","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"551d5033c3a3683a250001ab","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1326713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Wachsmann","original_name":"Daniel Wachsmann","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cd57919a6435008abbba48","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2506063,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daniel Horowitz","original_name":"Daniel Horowitz","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63cd57869a643500ae03a699","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0138884","wikidata_id":"Q7834326","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":934,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ypUUNT9ptMf4ZgW42mtxGqbCN9i.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":624},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":975,"iso_639_1":"he","file_path":"/9Z7GOjmalBG38hTfcBrjJucMiZt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":650}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
