Not only must they contend with each other, they must also deal with the bankers who have the power to shut them down at any moment. The story begins at the premier of director Viktor Rote's newest film \"The Tin Cat,\" which stars his popular wife Riki Rote. The film's writer and Viktor's brother Richard is miffed when he is not allowed into the screening. Viktor's ambitious mistress and aspiring star the Nina is also not invited in. The film is a hit so Rote is allowed to begin his new film by producer George Kuballa. George is also head of the studio. His rich and frequently rejected wife is Lore, a major financial studio backer who prefers spending her time consorting with her handsome young chauffeur.","popularity":0.3719,"poster_path":"/uMQGXfKNyDlAT3qt8PXDJT4YUCK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7397,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metropolis
