The film opens with an entranced seated woman working her fingers through a single strand of hair and proceeds to explore her lived imaginary in which desire and fear interlace. She re-visions different moments in time which are haunted by an absent lover. Like a playful fairy princess, this lover appears upside down in an armchair, hanging legs-down from the ceiling, playing dead on the floor, or eating roses; her body continuously permeates the woman’s reality. The film’s shifting points of view jump between the protagonist, fantasy spaces and her lover, making an internal world leak into what is external with the fluidity of blood into water.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/67IsjWKIk0KvqGRaa3RhjfvDVsa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swollen Stigma","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2762805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Pucill","original_name":"Sally Pucill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f4e833820af770037f7b6d6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2762806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachael Gomme","original_name":"Rachael Gomme","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f4e834e1684f70038757d21","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1297334,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah Pucill","original_name":"Sarah Pucill","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534553470e0a267bd7001c09","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2099735","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2250,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/67IsjWKIk0KvqGRaa3RhjfvDVsa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
