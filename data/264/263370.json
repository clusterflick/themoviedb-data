There he escapes to the world of memories, having imaginary conversations with his dead friend. However, the news of a new murder alerts him to the dangers lying ahead. Shot in Turkey following the years of military regime, Av Zamani carries autobiographical elements as the director Erden Kiral also had to flee the repressive regime of his country to be an exile in Germany. The weakness of the film is that the director is not able to take enough distance from the events to give the story a more universal appeal. Av Zamani was screened at the Montreal World Film Festival 1988.","popularity":0.1079,"poster_path":"/roGY3nJf2U2gNIvhlwgG84Vrubb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57301,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mine Film","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hunting Time","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1058958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aytaç Arman","original_name":"Aytaç Arman","popularity":0.2232,"profile_path":"/sF7IBfmzfOuK6bfmVIQURlqHVam.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"writer","credit_id":"60ecbef0dfaae9002d136d79","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":142769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Şerif Sezer","original_name":"Şerif Sezer","popularity":0.5149,"profile_path":"/oXyB4z975gWL0xWusL6bjBTKN6c.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"housekeeper","credit_id":"60ecbf19140bad0046234648","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1163381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zihni Küçümen","original_name":"Zihni Küçümen","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":"/dgLtbm2dqhgTPjM1Fz7uun8gnWx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Ali","credit_id":"60ecbf2dfe6c18002dfe6b0e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2796491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nüvit Özdoğru","original_name":"Nüvit Özdoğru","popularity":0.0862,"profile_path":"/6RrPKky4M7vOci2UjWiyvgOAGoB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"murder victim","credit_id":"60ecbf42dfaae90046d3c941","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3155694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dilaver Uyanık","original_name":"Dilaver Uyanık","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/i6c8CdIH5i3sRqn96qQv8tNyOTZ.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"fisherman","credit_id":"60ecbf65134d58002f0e58af","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1630190,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ferit Edgü","original_name":"Ferit Edgü","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ecbf87091e62005ea896be","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1811276,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kadri Yurdatap","original_name":"Kadri Yurdatap","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ecbf9a68b1ea00756eece4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":550371,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sarper Özsan","original_name":"Sarper Özsan","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ecbfc55f622b007eaafc4e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3155700,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sedan Isin","original_name":"Sedan Isin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ecc03c140bad002f065b4a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1811297,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Nevzat Dişiaçık","original_name":"Nevzat Dişiaçık","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ecc0146dc507002e03495e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3155698,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Nur Ozalp","original_name":"Nur Ozalp","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ecc02a51a64e005d5f3062","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1494809,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kenan Ormanlar","original_name":"Kenan Ormanlar","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60ecbfe4706e56002edc231f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erden Kıral","original_name":"Erden Kıral","popularity":0.0956,"profile_path":"/swYu2MoWoz6Mi1u3lWcB2A755QF.jpg","credit_id":"5799bc7ec3a36821d3000f65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0123388","wikidata_id":"Q10959936","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"tr","file_path":"/roGY3nJf2U2gNIvhlwgG84Vrubb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":527}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2041,"name":"island"},{"id":13028,"name":"writer"},{"id":34079,"name":"death"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-02-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
