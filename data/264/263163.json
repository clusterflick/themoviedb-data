The city assigns one of its best detectives, Yan Gao to find \"the Wise One,\" the crime lord behind the murders. To do this, Yan sets up a series of surveillance sights around the city. When port guard Ye learns that he and his supervisor have been chosen to monitor one of the Wise One's main hideouts, he is delighted. It is the most exciting thing to have happened to him in years. But problems come because he must work nights and is sworn to secrecy. His girlfriend Bai Lin misinterprets his absences and this causes trouble. More trouble comes when her old lover shows up. Matters are made worse when a message for Ye and Tian to stop their surveillance does not get through.","popularity":0.4695,"poster_path":"/q4fYs5k9BXFBJt5fC4Tc2LxtpYb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1997-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surveillance","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Ambush","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"趁热打劫","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Mai fu","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1412860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Feng Gong","original_name":"Feng Gong","popularity":0.2077,"profile_path":"/9eFGBGSfST2T1AFC1O0dmvOcGMq.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Ye Minzhu / 叶民主","credit_id":"54c00914c3a368404600ae65","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1072015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jiang Shan","original_name":"Jiang Shan","popularity":0.2387,"profile_path":"/sHPX5kyt4lsosQNg3DRGsszyckd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bai Lin / 百林","credit_id":"54c0092192514148f000da25","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teng Rujun","original_name":"Teng Ru-jun","popularity":0.1729,"profile_path":"/p3RMCjlrVK84Ud2TJHaE437Bd9N.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Tian Gongshun (as Rujun Teng) / 田恭顺","credit_id":"54c009dc9251413635009fe0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niu Zhen-Hua","original_name":"Niu Zhen-Hua","popularity":0.1056,"profile_path":"/dMVmeySzCcGj9cBIBX5p1OEhyeP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Zhi Zhe / 智者","credit_id":"54c00aa6c3a3681da0006dea","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zhang Jiayi","original_name":"张嘉益","popularity":0.9064,"profile_path":"/tQRxpV4zANdupViBw7nRyFtJqvR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gao Yang / 杨高","credit_id":"54c00b209251416eae008d35","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":134028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chen Hao","original_name":"Chen Hao","popularity":0.3055,"profile_path":"/hFZuGj7dkZlNQLRRIxY7TuJYXBZ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Tong Tong / 童童","credit_id":"54c00b8092514148f000da5d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1467672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Haihai Lin","original_name":"Haihai Lin","popularity":0.0618,"profile_path":"/hg7bHodiK6LbKGbuKyLhqRCwsh4.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Tai / 小邰","credit_id":"637b03601bf87600879950d3","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134026,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Huang Jianxin","original_name":"Huang Jianxin","popularity":0.5011,"profile_path":"/enSVmPi7UMS3YmiMhD7PWzoeguT.jpg","credit_id":"54c00bfc9251416e9b00970f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265187,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yang Yazhou","original_name":"Yang Yazhou","popularity":0.0586,"profile_path":"/515nLxhJVSGyO5ey9MaCDeW3QbU.jpg","credit_id":"54c00c0dc3a368389c009b9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0151464","wikidata_id":"Q7647026","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dOW5FrNLxVsgFKNCChH2FEcWLSW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q4fYs5k9BXFBJt5fC4Tc2LxtpYb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
