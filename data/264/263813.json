His world is very ordered and secure and perhaps feels a bit claustrophobic. When he observes that a murderer has been declared psychologically incompetent and is to be placed in a mental institution, probably for the rest of his life, François feels the murder's plight very keenly. As time goes by, the murderer's situation is more and more unbearable to him, and he breaks off his engagement. Afterward, he has a liaison with a girl he has not known before, an act that somehow frees him. Now he wants to free the murderer somehow.","popularity":0.3137,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":42044,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministère de la Culture Française de Belgique","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1978-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Une page d'amour","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2180216,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramon Berry","original_name":"Ramon Berry","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Moshé","credit_id":"5bf5cb679251415cc10b5936","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Geraldine Chaplin","original_name":"Geraldine Chaplin","popularity":1.6829,"profile_path":"/hu9GC4GaJhgsjz99IrmO5YnzHiC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lise","credit_id":"5bf5cb969251415cc80b6264","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17578,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sami Frey","original_name":"Sami Frey","popularity":0.4676,"profile_path":"/7yb6JIdlMNWxc6SKhRVxauxa9wW.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"François Karwitch","credit_id":"5bf5cba8c3a36818a50bb984","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Dalio","original_name":"Marcel Dalio","popularity":0.3696,"profile_path":"/yYZMbAl56e5S7uFbiFbj0YziIDB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"624d2cd118864b0055c212ee","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1828229,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maurice Rabinowicz","original_name":"Maurice Rabinowicz","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bf5cc35c3a36818a30cb830","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1828230,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yvette Michelems","original_name":"Yvette Michelems","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e0eb1a5f7be3773254cf1e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1828229,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maurice Rabinowicz","original_name":"Maurice Rabinowicz","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e0eb26c360d27b275ef092","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1828229,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maurice Rabinowicz","original_name":"Maurice Rabinowicz","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e0eb31c7be2998221c2fa2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4935638,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Joel Marcipont","original_name":"Joel Marcipont","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e0eb4564654fc659afd4fe","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1428112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Jacques Mathy","original_name":"Jean-Jacques Mathy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e0eb53000000000042a77a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4148754,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Yves Vandermereen","original_name":"Yves Vandermereen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e0eb5ec3ff8f9707080197","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":39694,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jean-Claude Bonfanti","original_name":"Jean-Claude Bonfanti","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e0eb71000000000042aab6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4935643,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Alain Verreyken","original_name":"Alain Verreyken","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e0eb9630b2e5c7af8fbf13","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4935645,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Julien Mortier","original_name":"Julien Mortier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e0eba907df9e2ad2bb4d05","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0170738","wikidata_id":"Q3549675","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"1978-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
