On his arrival, he is greeted with the words Herzlich Willkommen, or \"cordial, heartfelt welcome.\" However, once he finds employment, what he experiences is anything but a cordial welcome at his new job, where he is a teacher/counselor for \"wayward children\" located in a former castle. The institution is headed by a former Nazi who runs it with the help of the more criminal, bullying boys. Despite these obstacles, Friedrich manages to establish a rapport with a boy who wants to go \"straight,\" and also begins to have an affair with an attractive female teacher at the school.","popularity":0.5384,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1990-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Herzlich willkommen","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55897,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Uwe Bohm","original_name":"Uwe Bohm","popularity":0.3979,"profile_path":"/6yguQnb4EBUf5nstGdbZspUXmAm.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Friedrich Dombrowski","credit_id":"541abcd6c3a3684ea10013d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2340,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Auer","original_name":"Barbara Auer","popularity":0.5055,"profile_path":"/6luVLipGUCnjEJ6x0UKEqGByJOD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Elke Kramer","credit_id":"541abce3c3a3684ea10013de","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hark Bohm","original_name":"Hark Bohm","popularity":0.354,"profile_path":"/qbK0MB6h73iuqXJ4e8ttaKdHB1C.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Direktor Dr. Fischer","credit_id":"541abcf00e0a26013e001379","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Thalbach","original_name":"Anna Thalbach","popularity":0.4943,"profile_path":"/iDO5j72dsEYrLFfSYhQpUSzOYMd.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Iris","credit_id":"541abd010e0a26013e00137d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva-Maria Hagen","original_name":"Eva-Maria Hagen","popularity":0.2796,"profile_path":"/rETk5RoYSgDV1KjM7azjglOsZij.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Sekretärin","credit_id":"541abd22c3a3684e870012c7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Gwisdek","original_name":"Michael Gwisdek","popularity":0.4469,"profile_path":"/u7MRuYvinuG38duqsDsKIA2DxqV.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Hausmeister","credit_id":"541abd30c3a3684ea7001366","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5233,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Hoenig","original_name":"Heinz Hoenig","popularity":0.7131,"profile_path":"/7UEy95iM0OLLThG26ZdLL0H8vPt.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Iris' Vater","credit_id":"541abd550e0a26013b0012fb","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hark Bohm","original_name":"Hark Bohm","popularity":0.354,"profile_path":"/qbK0MB6h73iuqXJ4e8ttaKdHB1C.jpg","credit_id":"541abcbbc3a3684ea7001359","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1425569,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Richard Borowski","original_name":"Richard Borowski","popularity":0.0522,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642f3f1431032500bd557306","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37350,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jens-Peter Ostendorf","original_name":"Jens-Peter Ostendorf","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642f3e3b6dea3a00f396acca","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1143,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Edward Kłosiński","original_name":"Edward Kłosiński","popularity":0.0977,"profile_path":"/yUx8cVgLNoZbMbyTGIr0xFEUGQU.jpg","credit_id":"642f3e596dea3a00f396acd2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":36740,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Birgit Missal","original_name":"Birgit Missal","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642f3eb26dea3a00d43683ba","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":67419,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Peter C.
