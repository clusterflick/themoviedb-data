What's the street-level experience of voters in today's America? In a triumph of documentary storytelling, ELECTION DAY combines eleven stories--all shot simultaneously on November 2, 2004, from dawn until long past midnight--into one. Factory workers, ex-felons, harried moms, Native American activists and diligent poll watchers, from South Dakota to Florida, take the process of democracy into their own hands. The result: an entertaining, inspiring and sometimes unsettling tapestry of citizens determined on one fateful day to make their votes count.","popularity":0.5221,"poster_path":"/cxwBGZyyX4bQY9Wp5OVt5TQnAjo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Election Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1064947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katy Chevigny","original_name":"Katy Chevigny","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53438b080e0a2679bf0051a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117841,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kirsten Johnson","original_name":"Kirsten Johnson","popularity":0.3191,"profile_path":"/9h1DYSYLnPujVBtM4mklFDnZByj.jpg","credit_id":"5f77e17321621b00353d3822","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117841,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kirsten Johnson","original_name":"Kirsten Johnson","popularity":0.3191,"profile_path":"/9h1DYSYLnPujVBtM4mklFDnZByj.jpg","credit_id":"5f77edcb58efd30037ba0db6","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1010005","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cxwBGZyyX4bQY9Wp5OVt5TQnAjo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15134,"name":"election"},{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-03-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
