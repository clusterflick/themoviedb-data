Fugard's intense political opinions were enough for the USSR to object to Marigolds being shown in the 1980 Berlin Festival, but the objections were dropped when it was learned that Fugard had already built up a strong fan following in Eastern Europe (for various reasons, the film was not released in the US until 1984). Winston Ntshona stars as a black South African gardener who travels by foot into the white community looking for a job. Upon arriving, Ntshona discovers that another black, John Kani, may have been hired for that job. Ntshoa ruins the chances for himself and Kani by accusing the other man of planning a theft. Both men are eventually hired by a fellow outcast, a white poacher (played by Anthol Fugard himself). The message would seem to be that if the have-nots of the world stick together, it matters little how badly they're treated by the \"haves.\"","popularity":0.6844,"poster_path":"/hBGOUeE2FVOHLtfYl73LF8fsw3e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"1980-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marigolds in August","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Winston Ntshona","original_name":"Winston Ntshona","popularity":0.1546,"profile_path":"/uwtYuKAfjqncfD1lyYQ1uAavQRH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Daan","credit_id":"63efdbae15376c00b1ed82bc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Kani","original_name":"John Kani","popularity":0.9522,"profile_path":"/g7tqg3q128a5O2qXMCwVnXsow9I.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Melton","credit_id":"63efdbb815376c008335405b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Athol Fugard","original_name":"Athol Fugard","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":"/vr4iRP4Mvc8QWYUtceVKKEpebbB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Paulus Olifant","credit_id":"63efdbc44a4bfc00b2f8a97a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3925618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nomonde Mhlobiso","original_name":"Nomonde Mhlobiso","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Alice","credit_id":"63efdbcecaaca2007c7b88c9","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3925619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joyce Hesha","original_name":"Joyce Hesha","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Melton's wife","credit_id":"63efdbdba24c5000848c0bad","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3925620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mandla Nene","original_name":"Mandla Nene","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Man","credit_id":"63efdbe3caaca2007c7b88da","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3925621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Ntshinga","original_name":"Mabel Ntshinga","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Emily","credit_id":"63efdbeca24c5000d4e2c56a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3925622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dudu Nene","original_name":"Dudu Nene","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Sophie","credit_id":"63efdbf5524978009641643c","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3925625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zola Marwanqa","original_name":"Zola Marwanqa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Evelina","credit_id":"63efdc07a672540082024b0f","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Athol Fugard","original_name":"Athol Fugard","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":"/vr4iRP4Mvc8QWYUtceVKKEpebbB.jpg","credit_id":"63efdc1da67254007de7e828","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121419,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ross Devenish","original_name":"Ross Devenish","popularity":0.1261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63efdc14524978008efc791c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0138594","wikidata_id":"Q6763288","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2530,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hBGOUeE2FVOHLtfYl73LF8fsw3e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1687}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
