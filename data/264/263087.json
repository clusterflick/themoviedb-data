Patty feels like an outcast even in her own family and is unable to understand why her father can't seem to love her. Her town eventually becomes host to a prisoner of war camp. A young German soldier escapes from this camp, and Patty finds him hiding in her secret place in the woods outside of town. After getting to know him, she ends up harboring him from his captors and, in the way of many adolescents, falls in love with him. Patty knows what she is risking by helping him, but in his company, she feels important, special, and respected as she has never been. In the end, his regard lifts her self-esteem and helps her to face the heartbreaking events to come.","popularity":2.1091,"poster_path":"/86A35fAZL2WGWAobI9gtIf3e8b4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15869,"logo_path":null,"name":"Highgate Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":5253,"logo_path":"/cxgRBXMNcbcE0dIaeCc4tbDa4KI.png","name":"NBC Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer of My German Soldier","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":42195,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kristy McNichol","original_name":"Kristy McNichol","popularity":1.2381,"profile_path":"/uRrj8mDbEWgTLElb1tWdFrzayN1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Patty Bergen","credit_id":"533fb2e20e0a262b92000bb6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52374,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Davison","original_name":"Bruce Davison","popularity":1.1035,"profile_path":"/41JtouCUhnnBwWmdsemPydtk3FB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Anton Reiker","credit_id":"533fb2f20e0a262b29000bbe","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esther Rolle","original_name":"Esther Rolle","popularity":0.583,"profile_path":"/ulp6iIEtjAOvJ1f3pijRsNTsPE5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ruth","credit_id":"533fb2fc0e0a26361f000dc9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Constantine","original_name":"Michael Constantine","popularity":0.9731,"profile_path":"/lrLDIfx7Cjcx0Kk34ptY1BAABfP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Harry Bergen","credit_id":"533fb3070e0a262b5c000bee","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1216876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Barrie","original_name":"Barbara Barrie","popularity":0.4288,"profile_path":"/eUVrPjqoAKGFuF6ORUOEzfXgAhb.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Bergen","credit_id":"533fb3100e0a262b92000bbb","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":152699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Noble","original_name":"James Noble","popularity":0.1568,"profile_path":"/wx6flzyPDZrYZ0ppMCc4upV50JX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Pierce","credit_id":"640f9222ede1b000bac002f2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robyn Lively","original_name":"Robyn Lively","popularity":0.8095,"profile_path":"/tz4oKXOkJhHZezaQUTgo66gPn77.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sharon Bergen","credit_id":"640f922db4224200f79096d9","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1254685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Hall","original_name":"Margaret Hall","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/tt0zg1A376Q2YroYWHuqrQb0bt.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sister Parker","credit_id":"640f926fe18e3f0816c3f296","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Haney","original_name":"Anne Haney","popularity":0.5854,"profile_path":"/yb2RVcI5JLlFlT5wLVa8XNvnbAL.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mrs. Benn","credit_id":"640f92a2e18e3f07b423e6a8","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonny Shroyer","original_name":"Sonny Shroyer","popularity":0.2251,"profile_path":"/f68GKDlKc2KVGfmDoGNTQdO45of.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"McFee","credit_id":"640f92b0a6c104009afe5520","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3961812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jane Hickey","original_name":"Jane Hickey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Edna Louise","credit_id":"640f92bfb4224200d8659e8e","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1134774,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Nell Santacroce","original_name":"Mary Nell Santacroce","popularity":0.1716,"profile_path":"/qG5XHkQYpHVIs8Bpe0glSJB5teM.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Gussie Mae","credit_id":"640f92cbaf85de00839126d3","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3961813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Morris","original_name":"Roy Morris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Freddy","credit_id":"640f92e9ede1b0007b4e4dc9","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3961814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William Ovell","original_name":"William Ovell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":15,"character":"Mayor Holderness","credit_id":"640f930ec390c500a46765bb","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
