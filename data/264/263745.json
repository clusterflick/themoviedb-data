The two become pregnant and the evil genius persuades the king to believe that the senior queen poisoned the junior queen out of sheer jealousy; the king believes but takes no action. The frustrated Minister tries to eliminate the pregnant queen, but she is saved by a courtier whom the Minister kills. The pregnant queen escapes many trials and gives birth to a son (MGR). He grows up and meets a young woman (Janaki) and her friend (Nagaratnam) and falls in love, unaware that she is a princess. Their love grows, but when he comes to know that she is a princess, he distances himself from her. After many trials, the two come together and live happily.","popularity":0.1827,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1950-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marudhanaattu Ilavarasi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":584602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"M.
