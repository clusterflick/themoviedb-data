Valeska is the Polish/German matriarch of a family living on the German side of the border. Her son is involved with the Hitler youth, but nonetheless keeps secret the presence on family land of a Jew who is hiding from the authorities. When the son inadvertently kills a soldier to prevent his sister from being raped, he runs away after borrowing money from the Jewish man. When soldiers come to the family's door looking for the missing soldier who had been billeted there, the Jewish man commits suicide. In another episode, one of the family's daughters marries a German soldier in a ceremony presided over by a Polish priest.","popularity":0.1182,"poster_path":"/aPW9peGIwHD08ZpdIzlhzrpbpH4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1704,"logo_path":"/sb3PuMTgJgpPUY7x634etBAhodu.png","name":"Bavaria Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":20521,"logo_path":"/umPV6gEtvSiqGuNyXAuuXdGZRYe.png","name":"Neue Deutsche Filmgesellschaft","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1979-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die erste Polka","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":40954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Schell","original_name":"Maria Schell","popularity":0.721,"profile_path":"/8QbUcO9leIKtSfRruPqZWejrXt6.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Valeska Piontek","credit_id":"534b0972c3a3682dd8001ed5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernst Stankovski","original_name":"Ernst Stankovski","popularity":0.2095,"profile_path":"/cefkbKwqtUgFJnY4DX5d3dvMsTU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Anwalt Wondrak","credit_id":"534b0982c3a3682dd8001ed8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claus Theo G채rtner","original_name":"Claus Theo G채rtner","popularity":0.1713,"profile_path":"/2p3Rb2HUkZZe1XgFWATL3snQMn9.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Feldwebel Metzmacher","credit_id":"534f9137c3a3681cb5000964","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1183601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Maria Bauer","original_name":"Eva Maria Bauer","popularity":0.2163,"profile_path":"/dxyNr1F3yEt4dRcKuboe4icnRtG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tante Lucie","credit_id":"534b09adc3a3682df6001eeb","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1244674,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Helmut Krapp","original_name":"Helmut Krapp","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534f9199c3a3681ccc000997","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1310648,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Horst Bienek","original_name":"Horst Bienek","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534f9189c3a3681cc3000908","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32951,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Klaus Emmerich","original_name":"Klaus Emmerich","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"534f9170c3a3681cc3000904","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1244674,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Helmut Krapp","original_name":"Helmut Krapp","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f48818f45819900323b7253","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1540791,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"G체nter Blumhagen","original_name":"G체nter Blumhagen","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f488213bd101e003754f5d2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":9943,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Barbara Baum","original_name":"Barbara Baum","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4881cc8cfcc700354eb569","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3769,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael Ballhaus","original_name":"Michael Ballhaus","popularity":0.3246,"profile_path":"/9DHIGsrgeTWA0rch3fFGXTOl1lO.jpg","credit_id":"5f488173fd4a96003544e55a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1909839,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Dixie Sensburg","original_name":"Dixie Sensburg","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f4881e06cf3d50035298439","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1120227,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rolf M.
