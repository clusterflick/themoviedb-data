The hairstyles have changed, but the rebelliousness remains.","popularity":0.0723,"poster_path":"/kv98hlPInefC8MmqcE0jcmRoXkF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guidelines","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1604857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Leblanc","original_name":"Claude Leblanc","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Claude Leblanc","credit_id":"570d22e0c3a3685085000328","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1307960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-François Caissy","original_name":"Jean-François Caissy","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53437877c3a36814ff004733","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1020752,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Colette Loumède","original_name":"Colette Loumède","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6758b3610adb637add931944","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3476412","wikidata_id":"Q20032060","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/reKLsOMHsbQpO06AtpvNRCDq73E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kv98hlPInefC8MmqcE0jcmRoXkF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jKmliDFHCIIgIAHR8IH0POTekJP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2014-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
