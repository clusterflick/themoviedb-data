The setting is Jefferson City, Missouri, and Joseph Randolph, a VIP in a fictional electronics company, has just gotten the sack. The company bigwigs insist it is simply because of downsizing, but Randolph is not buying it. Enraged, he gets a handgun (this is the U.S.) and shoots five managers to death. Then he turns himself in and is eventually put in a psychiatric hospital by the police. His family suffers a series of tragedies that leave only his daughter to wonder about why her father was committed to an institution. She joins with a visiting reporter from Chicago and another interested man, and all three start digging deeper into the company's history.","popularity":0.3899,"poster_path":"/3wJ1ctdM6lIELQew0GHPGfzg5gx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39823,"logo_path":null,"name":"Popular Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":206718,"logo_path":null,"name":"DNS-Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films 66","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Price of Survival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"A túlélés ára","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le prix de la survie","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Il prezzo della vita","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Ditt pris för att överleva","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Cena przeżycia","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Piccoli","original_name":"Michel Piccoli","popularity":0.6123,"profile_path":"/4OgjMYKH3qi67HOeEvYoIeENMDW.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"René Winterhalter","credit_id":"5ec3a4486dea3a001cf8fff5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin West","original_name":"Martin West","popularity":0.1336,"profile_path":"/fP9U9ivqFWK3fgYDfFi2TQLsE6u.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Joseph C.
