Told in a sentimental tone, Burns weaves a lyrical tale of the great metropolis that encompasses not only the city's streets, but also that of the history of America. Though around fourteen hours in length, this epic documentary presents a thoughtful, entertaining look at our relatively young country. This installment covers The Gilded Age following the Civil War which saw the rise of the robber barons and the schism between wealth and poverty widen dramatically. The political life of the city, exemplified by William M. Tweed and Tammany Hall descended into total corruption. As the turn of the century dawned, New York City annexes Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.","popularity":0.1571,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New York: Sunshine and Shadow (1865–1898)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91394,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ric Burns","original_name":"Ric Burns","popularity":0.0755,"profile_path":"/lKRPWzp95lsKiytKT5OFHGBNLUR.jpg","credit_id":"534271adc3a368152f00348e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2293852","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
