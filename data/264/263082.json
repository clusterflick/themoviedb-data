For his 60th birthday, a self-absorbed composer, Adam, does just that: he assembles seven of the most influential women from his life and invites them to his seduced lakeside cabin. The guest list includes Adam's current wife Eva, along with their two children who live in Berlin; his gorgeous second wife Lulu, who is an actress; and his down-to-earth first wife-turned-nun Berenice, with whom Adam has an embittered, estranged son Billy, who shows up along with his wife. Also invited are a quartet of women with whom he had often overlapping trysts, including student Marion, sexy Jacqueline, opera singer Lucia, and of course, Lilith.","popularity":0.4164,"poster_path":"/lH7gG0lQpI1zq3NJpYIVNoFt37i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradiso - Sieben Tage mit sieben Frauen","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanns Zischler","original_name":"Hanns Zischler","popularity":0.3326,"profile_path":"/5O4Dum1OuKI4RMB24xjACkL22iA.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Adam","credit_id":"542c7ac20e0a26079e0001fc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1177326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cora Frost","original_name":"Cora Frost","popularity":0.0412,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Eva","credit_id":"58b9b0f6c3a368664d00ce44","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":46992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adriana Altaras","original_name":"Adriana Altaras","popularity":0.3939,"profile_path":"/LZybMQQCzFDdqKJKkPhQYP6U1X.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lulu","credit_id":"58b9b133c3a368664d00ce66","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irm Hermann","original_name":"Irm Hermann","popularity":0.1783,"profile_path":"/4NzeDGGAqq0Aw8QpqTuOAu7DkeN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Berenice","credit_id":"542c7ad2c3a36845cf0001e7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":543328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabine Bach","original_name":"Sabine Bach","popularity":0.1564,"profile_path":"/51ZnJMXBr82pxocIMSQiKCE9uAq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lilith","credit_id":"58b9b17c925141608400d0e7","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marquard Bohm","original_name":"Marquard Bohm","popularity":0.2646,"profile_path":"/iaoq5Hv8eBvWOwl2evapI8zahjO.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Rolf Silber","credit_id":"542c7ae50e0a26079e000200","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1053727,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guntram Brattia","original_name":"Guntram Brattia","popularity":0.1397,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Billy","credit_id":"55e61cc59251410f07000546","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":929388,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Khyana El Bitar","original_name":"Khyana El Bitar","popularity":0.1209,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Marion","credit_id":"58b9b1db925141608400d11b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1177325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeska Hanel","original_name":"Valeska Hanel","popularity":0.0289,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Katherina","credit_id":"58b9b1f0c3a368666b00be10","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabell Hindersin","original_name":"Isabell Hindersin","popularity":0.0721,"profile_path":"/tXUY3N8LUf7axI8iPAWAL1vuDED.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Lucia","credit_id":"58b9b212925141607300cc4c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucas Hoppe","original_name":"Lucas Hoppe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"58b9b226925141606b00d5da","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hartmut Kühn","original_name":"Hartmut Kühn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Tenor","credit_id":"58b9b23d925141606f00d05b","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1769265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Petra Lipinski","original_name":"Petra Lipinski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"1.
