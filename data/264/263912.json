Danny, their waiter, comes by offering refills; after determining they are twins, he guesses which is the evil one. Without a pause, he sits down and offers his theory about Elvis's twin. He drones on. The good twin finally speaks up, giving her own opinion. The waiter is unfazed. After his boss finally calls him back to work, the twins are free to resume their bickering amidst the coffee and cigarettes.","popularity":1.0633,"poster_path":"/yHBVwbMkeHLZoeBH13vcoSm11D0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21612,"logo_path":null,"name":"Black Snake","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coffee and Cigarettes II","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":64,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joie Lee","original_name":"Joie Lee","popularity":0.6247,"profile_path":"/jv3l0csEmVVOMNSmhKrOT543vqm.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Good Twin","credit_id":"53457204c3a3682598001902","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cinqué Lee","original_name":"Cinqué Lee","popularity":0.0914,"profile_path":"/vLnLN6ZZrNnUBjcxEAqThl9OK7F.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Evil Twin","credit_id":"53457213c3a36825a8001820","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Buscemi","original_name":"Steve Buscemi","popularity":3.3764,"profile_path":"/lQKdHMxfYcCBOvwRKBAxPZVNtkg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Waiter","credit_id":"5345721dc3a36825a00018d1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1308375,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Frank Kern","original_name":"Frank Kern","popularity":0.0583,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53457289c3a3682598001913","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3264,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Rudd Simmons","original_name":"Rudd Simmons","popularity":0.129,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5345724ac3a3682591001861","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6406,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Melody London","original_name":"Melody London","popularity":0.056,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5345727ac3a36825820018d3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4834,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jim Stark","original_name":"Jim Stark","popularity":0.3207,"profile_path":"/xph5W8hp7CtVUj8qyzO8gURmmfB.jpg","credit_id":"53457256c3a36825820018d1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Jarmusch","original_name":"Jim Jarmusch","popularity":0.5434,"profile_path":"/iMpIrvhoO9SZWhiDkSzaUt9Yd4N.jpg","credit_id":"5345723bc3a36825820018c2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Jarmusch","original_name":"Jim Jarmusch","popularity":0.5434,"profile_path":"/iMpIrvhoO9SZWhiDkSzaUt9Yd4N.jpg","credit_id":"53457231c3a36825a00018d8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1632,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Robby Müller","original_name":"Robby Müller","popularity":0.2708,"profile_path":"/1YeDTwdFQNxM6hDADl0bKfuX7Fx.jpg","credit_id":"592514e8c3a36877ee0098a3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0090862","wikidata_id":"Q4236459","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yHBVwbMkeHLZoeBH13vcoSm11D0.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2400,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qNyaDzGJuDCXEhY3uwNwyhIdBtE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3170,"name":"cigarette"},{"id":2439,"name":"coffee"},{"id":6335,"name":"tennessee"},{"id":3702,"name":"memphis, tennessee"},{"id":40950,"name":"waiter"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Coffee and Cigarettes-Twins","key":"H2MyCmRrCaQ","published_at":"2007-05-30T22:21:45.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"534573cbc3a368259800193b"}]}}}
