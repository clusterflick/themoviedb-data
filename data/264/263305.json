His initial successes made this seem like a good idea at the time, but by 1944, after an unparalleled series of military defeats that Hitler refused even to acknowledge, a group of high-ranking military and political figures in Germany decided to assassinate him and take over the government. Unfortunately for them, their assassination attempt failed, and the knives were out to find all the people involved in the attempt. The most wanted person in the coup was Carl Goerdeler (Dieter Schaad), a respected figure in German public life for many decades. Twenty years earlier, a girl by the name of Helene Schwärzel (Katherina Thalbach) met Goerdeler. After the coup attempt, during the nationwide manhunt, Helene recognized him and notified the authorities. In addition to receiving a huge reward, she became the focus of a nationwide propaganda campaign, and was widely resented for her \"success.\"","popularity":0.4206,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1993-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Denunciation","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":130913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marquard Bohm","original_name":"Marquard Bohm","popularity":0.2646,"profile_path":"/iaoq5Hv8eBvWOwl2evapI8zahjO.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jean Blome / Hans Blome","credit_id":"551e8bffc3a3683a1c002ef1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3934,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Burghart Klaußner","original_name":"Burghart Klaußner","popularity":0.4813,"profile_path":"/zW2GyFbSfmGlbJTgMZqqk5aj458.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Werner Kraengel","credit_id":"551e8c0e925141173f00282f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richy Müller","original_name":"Richy Müller","popularity":0.375,"profile_path":"/69W9VO478asbTZJrhqOfHddyunF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Walter Bethke","credit_id":"551e8c209251413741002e06","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tana Schanzara","original_name":"Tana Schanzara","popularity":0.3004,"profile_path":"/j4TO3vkKn8A3F0ZMbTZQD1d1UnY.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mutter Schwärzel","credit_id":"551e8c2f925141173f002836","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katharina Thalbach","original_name":"Katharina Thalbach","popularity":0.5324,"profile_path":"/dFOwcCqKnFseJdShQmjwMzwxHfu.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Helene Schwaerzel","credit_id":"551e8c3e92514137430030f0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3755,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karl-Heinz von Hassel","original_name":"Karl-Heinz von Hassel","popularity":0.2009,"profile_path":"/bL06O3ReJrJD4xeAtUvVe4Yw3RJ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Direktor der Deutschen Bank","credit_id":"551e8c549251413741002e11","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Fitz","original_name":"Peter Fitz","popularity":0.201,"profile_path":"/uuS2Tbva1PdAeMxFKUjlO1V7eJN.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Anwalt","credit_id":"551e8c62c3a3683a25002d00","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Eichhorn","original_name":"Christoph Eichhorn","popularity":0.2356,"profile_path":"/gNmRXmiKk79yssYGuy9B07dJkAb.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Photograph","credit_id":"551e8c719251413741002e15","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Schade","original_name":"Doris Schade","popularity":0.2309,"profile_path":"/aFhyDdmrd3jJJ0TI64uO0cUWCXP.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Psychiaterin","credit_id":"551e8c85c3a368251d0014ec","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanns Zischler","original_name":"Hanns Zischler","popularity":0.3326,"profile_path":"/5O4Dum1OuKI4RMB24xjACkL22iA.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Erfinder","credit_id":"55ae46299251411e1800a2cc","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Traugott Buhre","original_name":"Traugott Buhre","popularity":0.0891,"profile_path":"/tcAx6jCeQufFQ2c6f7zhC8xQBqS.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Direktor der Dresdner Bank","credit_id":"55f358479251414a67000c7d","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dieter Schaad","original_name":"Dieter Schaad","popularity":0.1244,"profile_path":"/hR7IuRLAuqrQMbZGxqTofiavdQi.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Carl Goerdeler","credit_id":"5c770f9fc3a36842c0900b53","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380138,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Mitscherlich","original_name":"Thomas Mitscherlich","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"551e8bef9251411d8d00094a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0106703","wikidata_id":"Q6316563","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
