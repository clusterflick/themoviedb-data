When he hears that his mother is mortally ill, he returns to Munich to be at her bedside, but doesn't quite make it. He and sister Astrid (Elke Haltaufderheide) rediscover their friendship, though, as they go through a number of crises. Meanwhile, Anton makes an effort to find work in Munich, and runs headlong into the silliness and pretensions of the \"New German Cinema\" movement.","popularity":0.2722,"poster_path":"/5JnP14sLZ0ITek6kAjac5wZCHY6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24825,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visual KW Film and Television Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1977-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Vertreibung aus dem Paradies","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jochen Busse","original_name":"Jochen Busse","popularity":0.377,"profile_path":"/1oCy5wBFDQLTCYvZeSEDmORHxif.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Berens","credit_id":"536a99f7c3a36812380081d0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":39091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Rau","original_name":"Andrea Rau","popularity":0.136,"profile_path":"/v7sKF3OkRH5ay3VoFa8LWaJWSfe.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Evi","credit_id":"536a9a04c3a368124a0085b6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Fux","original_name":"Herbert Fux","popularity":0.2508,"profile_path":"/6fxgv19OAVQjGUSRODwRczPtZ55.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Kameramann","credit_id":"536a9a13c3a368124a0085b9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wolfgang Lukschy","original_name":"Wolfgang Lukschy","popularity":0.2375,"profile_path":"/mYKzLH0RF922ZRVp65ZhAndBcFI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hehler","credit_id":"536a9a23c3a3681212008320","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herb Andress","original_name":"Herb Andress","popularity":0.2222,"profile_path":"/uOr5qEi3nqxsS38T4ITIcCGb8uw.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Anton Paulisch/Andy Pauls","credit_id":"5395bb030e0a266dce006b02","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1169335,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elke Haltaufderheide","original_name":"Elke Haltaufderheide","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Astrid Paulisch","credit_id":"5395bb1b0e0a266db7006b00","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":36987,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trude Breitschopf","original_name":"Trude Breitschopf","popularity":0.2842,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Kundin","credit_id":"5395bb310e0a266dc500686f","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":559091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tonio von der Meden","original_name":"Tonio von der Meden","popularity":0.077,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Mechaniker im Werbefilm","credit_id":"5a14bc5ec3a3680729000c4d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Münster","original_name":"Klaus Münster","popularity":0.1266,"profile_path":"/hQukSa7ODW2wgQlt42WnclqL2Tn.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mann am Bahnhof","credit_id":"5a14bc6bc3a3680746000b87","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Gempart","original_name":"Michael Gempart","popularity":0.123,"profile_path":"/r6VggY2FEkiD2OLxEzYWYQnjKH1.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5a14bc7ac3a3680723000b83","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211253,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Niklaus Schilling","original_name":"Niklaus Schilling","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5395bae90e0a266dc2006a2c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0075387","wikidata_id":"Q1217247","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5JnP14sLZ0ITek6kAjac5wZCHY6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":650}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1977-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
