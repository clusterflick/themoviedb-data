Set during the time before the state of Israel was created and established, a British officer has been captured by a band of Jewish resistance fighters with the intent of killing him at dawn. One of the Jews was sentenced to die after being captured by the English, and this death will be in retaliation. The trouble is that a young and ambivalent fighter is left holding the officer captive with orders to shoot him at the pre-arranged time. It is a long night of soul-searching before the Jewish soldier comes up with a solution to his quandary.","popularity":0.7086,"poster_path":"/edJEAjbdArkuLvEZ8yIrfHVzugv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1712,"logo_path":null,"name":"Odessa
