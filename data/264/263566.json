Just after this decision, the young man's real mother contacts him and asks him to come and stay with her and his father (she is a high-ranking Party official). She is against his marriage but her husband is not. In the end, the young man decides to marry at the home of his real parents, and when his foster mother shows up, his real mother treats her like dirt - it turns out that the foster mother was a concubine for awhile. Before things deteriorate any further, the husband has some news for his wife that helps her to see the foster mother in a different light.","popularity":0.1934,"poster_path":"/p9U2esruZ6SxHU30C4wuYzfwLqc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3406,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ningxia Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"},{"id":60498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pearl River Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1981-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call of the Home Village","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Longing for My Native Country","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Call of The Home Village","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Xiang Qing","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1341752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Huang Jinchang","original_name":"Huang Jinchang","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/jVqphPI762UXAfHLlKymCNvFMdM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"53c4ea5b0e0a261e0300144f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1341753,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yexiang Ren","original_name":"Yexiang Ren","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":"/n7NkHmR9vQ6X062Z4rhSbs60c5p.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"53c4ea6e0e0a261dfc0015ac","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1524353,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wang Jin","original_name":"Wang Jin","popularity":0.0814,"profile_path":"/wXvKL0rDAnOVv5XXdyecd7D1sWj.jpg","credit_id":"60e5ba6ab76cbb00461975a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1341751,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hu Bingliu","original_name":"Hu Bingliu","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":"/9yoBWROBznac0l19dV11wpKlC31.jpg","credit_id":"53c4ea4d0e0a261e0f0013c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0133281","wikidata_id":"Q6673949","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.752,"height":1171,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/p9U2esruZ6SxHU30C4wuYzfwLqc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":881}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1981-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
