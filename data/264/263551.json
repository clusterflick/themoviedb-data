Eventually, the men cannot help but note the woman's silence -- it turns out she is running away from her employers who felt she was pretty much a derelict, and from some friends who were of questionable ethics, though she is not about to say anything to the two men. When she gets off the train in Nanjing, one of the young men from the train -- somewhat worried about his silent travel partner -- decides to follow her to make sure she will be okay. And it is a good thing he did so because she is menacingly approached by some obvious thugs and the young man gets her out of the potentially hazardous encounter.","popularity":0.0534,"poster_path":"/ffivCFa801PZ89s0L8nP8k7prgR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":708,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beijing Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strange Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"Mo sheng de peng you","type":"romanization"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1348647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Li Ling","original_name":"Li Ling","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":"/lrtVwDkqdXE9S1DaXrpg203L5iU.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"54df81d7c3a36855c700181f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1427224,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Xu Lei","original_name":"Xu Lei","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"54df8185c3a36855c7001815","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0134824","wikidata_id":"Q7621389","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kTvw974esuaqtsT0t0PrPao2hJU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ffivCFa801PZ89s0L8nP8k7prgR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1983-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
