It was only with the introduction of sound, beginning with Study No 6 that the films did full justice to this musical principle. The play of the white lines, the arcs, and the upside-down Uâ€™s running hither and thither like ballet dancers was brought into perfect synchronization with the music, and thus the films offered an abstract illustration of the melodies. Study No 6 is certainly the best of his films in terms of forms. - Hans Scheugl and Ernst Schmidt, Jr.  Preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2001.","popularity":0.081,"poster_path":"/tQPcAfWShDfOQUthcUELTkjzirM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1930-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Study No. 6","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":13,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29549,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Oskar Fischinger","original_name":"Oskar Fischinger","popularity":0.1216,"profile_path":"/6NjYxPvqwubzilB9nOlkm1H9ipx.jpg","credit_id":"53454185c3a36825820015f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0021429","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tQPcAfWShDfOQUthcUELTkjzirM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":309397,"name":"preserved film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
