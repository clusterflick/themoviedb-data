Katharina, daughter of a Yugoslavian immigrant worker, has grown up in the Federal Republic of Germany. She is a confident, energetic career woman who has managed to work her way up to become a successful television journalist. She goes to visit her parent's country, to do a story about the children of immigrant workers in their home country. Although she says she doesn´t need a \"home\" any more, even she feels strange in her own country. Peter is a rather \"untypical\" sort of man: a dreamer, a thinker. He has given up his steady job as a composer for advertising films and is divorced. He goes to Jugoslavia to find something out about the past. He travels to the places where his father was stationed during the Second World War.","popularity":0.4398,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5132,"logo_path":null,"name":"Von Vietinghoff
