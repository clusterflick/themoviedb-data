He was too young to have an opinion about it, but he was mightily impressed all the same. Now it is 1968, and he is a young man. When the Russian tanks come rolling through his village on their way to suppress the stirrings of freedom in Prague, he does what he can to ensure that he's in good odor with those who will inevitably come out on top. This meandering political drama is apparently an exploration of opportunism, but reviewers gave it low marks for clarity of exposition.","popularity":0.2293,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":89526,"logo_path":null,"name":"UGC-Hachette Première","origin_country":""},{"id":25021,"logo_path":null,"name":"Constellation","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":12514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Slovenská filmová tvorba","origin_country":"XC"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1991-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the Stars Were Red","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Quand les étoiles étaient rouges","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2936516,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Miloš Pietor","original_name":"Miloš Pietor","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633aff36b0ba7e0090b31d90","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1350060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Václav Koubek","original_name":"Václav Koubek","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59011ef692514155d6002e17","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2402,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Claudie Ossard","original_name":"Claudie Ossard","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/mP1eCTccTzqMWp7kCV1mr82i0iF.jpg","credit_id":"59011eefc3a36810a8002e88","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72802,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Milan Čorba","original_name":"Milan Čorba","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59011f2f92514155d2002cdf","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1804488,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eugen Gindl","original_name":"Eugen Gindl","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59011ede92514155e2002c27","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11692,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vladimír Smutný","original_name":"Vladimír Smutný","popularity":0.0836,"profile_path":"/d8x2sN335ajQwQevOxEU9sBJ2hJ.jpg","credit_id":"59011efdc3a36810c6002b6b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1804488,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eugen Gindl","original_name":"Eugen Gindl","popularity":0.0437,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59011edac3a3681123002cc2","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1016839,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Čédomir Kolar","original_name":"Čédomir Kolar","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59011ee7c3a36810c6002b5b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1804490,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Maros Cernák","original_name":"Maroš Černák","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"59011f2392514155c6002bbc","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dušan Trančík","original_name":"Dušan Trančík","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/bUKba26fiyvvdAUTXuXApBeIRa4.jpg","credit_id":"59b34d189251414a2b007283","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":138064,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dušan Trančík","original_name":"Dušan Trančík","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/bUKba26fiyvvdAUTXuXApBeIRa4.jpg","credit_id":"59b34d29c3a3684ee300676e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0175804","wikidata_id":"Q7993039","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlin International Film Festival","release_date":"1991-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
