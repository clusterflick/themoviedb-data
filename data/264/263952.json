She begins to tell the story of how her parents discovered their son Randall was autistic and how each reacted to that. Her mother had three more kids, all daughters, \"the perfect children.\" The controversy over that and Randall's treatment pulls the parents apart. It also forces Nina and her older brother Mack to re-evaluate their relationship with each other and each parent.","popularity":1.5568,"poster_path":"/2btFymmK2QhFnYnA2JiR2E2MczN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":183,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Family Pictures","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5657,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anjelica Huston","original_name":"Anjelica Huston","popularity":1.6837,"profile_path":"/6hnYeHa7Rc1w1MmQ3JsLSIb7yCX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lainey Eberlin","credit_id":"5345d7fbc3a3682f2d00039e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Neill","original_name":"Sam Neill","popularity":2.486,"profile_path":"/iIfuxalf37xUayuGyK0zG7z6WEZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"David Eberlin","credit_id":"5345d802c3a3682f1900038d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":26467,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyra Sedgwick","original_name":"Kyra Sedgwick","popularity":1.274,"profile_path":"/cfpLVZWChElvkKegZopC0xDjEWk.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nina Eberlin","credit_id":"5345d80bc3a3682f19000391","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20212,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dermot Mulroney","original_name":"Dermot Mulroney","popularity":2.784,"profile_path":"/kkrMKD6b4vEdphVgKsenRY4NgiC.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mack","credit_id":"5345d81dc3a3682f0400033c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Harrold","original_name":"Jamie Harrold","popularity":0.4564,"profile_path":"/vtBL6DCxCL2qCCh8aI6LRHOtc8V.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Randall","credit_id":"5345d825c3a3682f2d0003a8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1109370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Campbell","original_name":"Sarah Campbell","popularity":0.0892,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Liddie (9)","credit_id":"5a09fbfec3a36820fa006043","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1258635,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jennifer Miller","original_name":"Jennifer Miller","popularity":0.1463,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5345d7e9c3a3682efd000390","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107414,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Saville","original_name":"Philip Saville","popularity":0.233,"profile_path":"/8F1WR2Ouo8Qnbe4ngzaNtHKmCpd.jpg","credit_id":"5345d7f0c3a3682f2600035f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0106859","wikidata_id":"Q16993016","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1ahbdM1MyI7i4Z2ZQ7FiZLUP02H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2btFymmK2QhFnYnA2JiR2E2MczN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-03-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"FAMILY PICTURES (1993) | Official Trailer","key":"bBLFkmmovgw","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2018-04-25T20:34:59.000Z","id":"6426f0998de0ae01134efc7c"}]}}}
