It is a human-interest story with universal appeal, not simply a film for motorcyclists. It examines the motivation, passion and risk associated with the quest. It chronicles first hand the events of the journey. It explores the question of why anyone would go racing. One Man's Island captures the experience of realising a dream.","popularity":0.0624,"poster_path":"/xpF4Jpsh5merTan2ipsqCAs6qUJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Everyone should have a dream","title":"One Man's Island","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0424327","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":950,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xpF4Jpsh5merTan2ipsqCAs6qUJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
