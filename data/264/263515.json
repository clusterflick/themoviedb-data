The queen has snuck back to her Kingdom of Skedaddle. But one person’s loss is a scoundrel’s gain: Bonifacio, a teller of tall tales, sees in the forlorn queen the perfect target for his hackneyed charms. As summer approaches, he changes himself into a sweet talker and sings her praises. Things would have worked out perfectly if only Princess Molly hadn’t arrived on the scene. While visiting her mother, she quickly discovers the hoax: the queen thinks she’s found a new husband in Bonifacio. But the swindling storyteller is really only interested in the kingdom’s legends.","popularity":0.3774,"poster_path":"/eK3Du55pWXbkf1exS2k2e8WhnR7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8212,"logo_path":"/pkWt7XNwx5GssnXmTsXLKNpalaH.png","name":"Folimage","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":21563,"logo_path":"/72Iv8jLQiH1AzsvRAQrVu0WG3MX.png","name":"Piwi+","origin_country":""},{"id":21559,"logo_path":null,"name":"Subséquence","origin_country":""},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF
