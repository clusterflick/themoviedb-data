But Volume 7 is also jam packed with newly unearthed treasures, featuring singing rabbis, petulant news anchors, coughing snake handlers, bodybuilding clowns, and two body parts never before seen in the festival! It's a celebration of a decade of Found. Record over and you'll die! Taped live at The Grey Eagle in Asheville, North Carolina.","popularity":0.086,"poster_path":"/94se9TZTKmQbTaF3bpeOfu7vgaS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Unearthing VHS monstrosities since 2004","title":"Found Footage Festival Volume 7: Live in Asheville","video":true,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Pickett","original_name":"Joe Pickett","popularity":0.0899,"profile_path":"/qaVGmThDf5aa6TluTj5YQN25Cfu.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"533f5d90c3a36830d30003f3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Prueher","original_name":"Nick Prueher","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/iAOVgXkfJxJBkcvnM9QJQpGSPVW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self, Chef Keith","credit_id":"533f5db2c3a36830f3000566","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Prueher","original_name":"Nick Prueher","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/iAOVgXkfJxJBkcvnM9QJQpGSPVW.jpg","credit_id":"533f5e29c3a36830e30003da","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Pickett","original_name":"Joe Pickett","popularity":0.0899,"profile_path":"/qaVGmThDf5aa6TluTj5YQN25Cfu.jpg","credit_id":"533f5dcbc3a36830e30003c9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/94se9TZTKmQbTaF3bpeOfu7vgaS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":8201,"name":"satire"},{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
