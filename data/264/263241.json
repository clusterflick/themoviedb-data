The former East German agent is Otto Skrodt who after many years is about to be promoted in the highest government ranks. He is anxious to maintain a squeaky clean image. His daughter is Isabelle. The young and friendly Kalle returns after spending many years in jail for his escape attempts. He doesn't know exactly who blew the whistle, but his friend Skrodt is definitely under suspicion. Kalle returns to ostensibly renew the friendship and to see Isabelle whom he loves. The duplicitous friendship between the two men becomes the main focus of the story which features interesting plot twists at the end.","popularity":0.5641,"poster_path":"/5QQ81gJbQSgQY4YrggbIe67scGq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Journal-Film Klaus Volkenborn KG","origin_country":""},{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":264,"logo_path":"/fA90qwUKgPhMONqtwY60GaHRyrW.png","name":"Studio Babelsberg","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1994-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blue One","video":false,"vote_average":3.9,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manfred Krug","original_name":"Manfred Krug","popularity":0.1563,"profile_path":"/4qfxHPHzQhmNHXtVB6AuXIXZISf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Otto Skrodt","credit_id":"5448aa8d0e0a26747c00116c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8196,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrich Mühe","original_name":"Ulrich Mühe","popularity":0.5934,"profile_path":"/kdqKmnaBDDT0cwTE2C3fKDJrF8D.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Karl 'Kalle' Kaminski","credit_id":"5448aaa0c3a3680fa5001103","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8790,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meret Becker","original_name":"Meret Becker","popularity":0.3585,"profile_path":"/yPi5MesrPi9z1AQIiCVXNTV9c5U.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Isabelle Skrodt","credit_id":"5448aab1c3a3680fc3000f71","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Manchen","original_name":"Klaus Manchen","popularity":0.1298,"profile_path":"/qlVSLW2BHcq4RLsI1UV3MgDmcIn.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Führungsoffizier Werner","credit_id":"5448aac60e0a2674790010bb","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":234134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marijam Agischewa","original_name":"Marijam Agischewa","popularity":0.2043,"profile_path":"/1sLqH7m6rE2l6h6SinhXOSVDx92.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mandy Skrodt","credit_id":"5448aae10e0a2674830010a9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hanns Zischler","original_name":"Hanns Zischler","popularity":0.3326,"profile_path":"/5O4Dum1OuKI4RMB24xjACkL22iA.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Minister","credit_id":"5448aaf6c3a3680fbb000f0f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":129307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margret Völker","original_name":"Margret Völker","popularity":0.0707,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Briefträgerin","credit_id":"5448ab0ec3a3680fa5001118","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1504142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Claude Mawila","original_name":"Jean Claude Mawila","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Martin -
