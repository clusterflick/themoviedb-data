Marian is a journalist who has been working in Latin America and who arrives home just after her father dies to find out that the man she had married for purely political reasons might be deported because the authorities found out he was not living with her. Meanwhile, Marian is upset that her mother and sister are keeping her mentally handicapped brother in an institution, and she goes there to get him released into her custody -- a mistake it turns out. He is actually worse off with her, and vice-versa. On top of everything, Marian cannot break away from the depression she feels over a tragic incident that happened while she was in Latin America -- and anything she does is colored by that moment from the past. These burdens become almost too much to bear, both for Marian and the viewers.","popularity":0.2848,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1984-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Silent Pacific","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The silent ocean","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":222942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josse De Pauw","original_name":"Josse De Pauw","popularity":0.2193,"profile_path":"/tStPpTzPhongz2t6TGOrnMhOwzF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Emil Winters","credit_id":"5c92343b0e0a2612ed5d0f59","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johan Leysen","original_name":"Johan Leysen","popularity":0.3145,"profile_path":"/pCBvrMKTNo6cqC63qDSipbtt2Rs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Jan Verstraete","credit_id":"5c92344dc3a36861075319e9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140495,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Schoenaerts","original_name":"Julien Schoenaerts","popularity":0.1617,"profile_path":"/5kj1IaLxA8jChe0MvIIylOo2WIp.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Frits Rosmeyer","credit_id":"5c923464c3a368611152e452","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":210966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrea Domburg","original_name":"Andrea Domburg","popularity":0.0742,"profile_path":"/xKFinGTbZu9WxBb88CWhWiwHgo3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Emilia Winters","credit_id":"5c92347ac3a3686119533a85","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1560148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josée Ruiter","original_name":"Josée Ruiter","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/yihkGOkG2PmUrzivKSRDOTFuRVM.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Marian Winters","credit_id":"5c923490c3a3681c954ff777","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1277038,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Moniek Kramer","original_name":"Moniek Kramer","popularity":0.0527,"profile_path":"/bNNmcHSQZ7EfWnrCGSOp0Pep2J4.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Rita Winters","credit_id":"6022f94cc5ada500407c9a92","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1368920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaap van Donselaar","original_name":"Jaap van Donselaar","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"t.v. redacteur","credit_id":"6022f98e8b959e003d1c720a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reinout Bussemaker","original_name":"Reinout Bussemaker","popularity":0.1678,"profile_path":"/g0XgcYDjbNEdHdKArOREBOxtcsr.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Begeleider Tehuis","credit_id":"6022f9ab458199003da95a14","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsje de Wijn","original_name":"Elsje de Wijn","popularity":0.0575,"profile_path":"/eYc4CHjNgZ7zfFYRSKdIYdZMAfi.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Receptioniste","credit_id":"6022f9c19d2b63003d6407cf","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Tuinman","original_name":"Peter Tuinman","popularity":0.1173,"profile_path":"/sr7GoYcunb09joBwdcXSMb2ngZ.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"agent","credit_id":"65b2c540ce4ddc014a8abc8c","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":232631,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Digna Sinke","original_name":"Digna Sinke","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c923423c3a368611f52f17d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2971366,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Annemarie Van de Putte","original_name":"Annemarie Van de Putte","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6022f8d39d2b63003e64614d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marion Hänsel","original_name":"Marion Hänsel","popularity":0.1597,"profile_path":"/4FnSPGI0KbRXmrTo8P9YAzQxOE6.jpg","credit_id":"6022f91595c0af003e531f53","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2270404,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Albert van der Wildt","original_name":"Albert van der Wildt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6022f8f1dd25890040bb7e81","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0088174","wikidata_id":"Q5244982","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"1984-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
