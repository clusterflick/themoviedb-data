While they appear to have similar faces and body shapes, they wear different clothes and hairstyles, but the biggest difference between them is that one lives in 1942 and the other in 2020. When the girls crawled into a wooden chest they were magically sent into each other’s timeline, and because the girls look so similar their family and friends do not notice the swap.","popularity":0.824,"poster_path":"/5NoyPj2ZoSkMXwqJwUm93EQIyBY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12689,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radar
