Urban prison transportation was filmed from the inside of a moving vehicle and is composed of lateral travelling shots, which move consistently forward, while swinging from left to right with a varying degree of acceleration. There is no double-exposure or editing-in-camera; the background consists of walls, parks, wastegrounds, stations and platforms. These compositions in movement display various degrees of depth of field; speed decreases as we retreat, diffracted by the systematic presence of the grills and bars separating us from more distant motifs.","popularity":0.1265,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transport carcéral urbain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1449517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominik Lange","original_name":"Dominik Lange","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3f1a22ae36680012cbb904","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
