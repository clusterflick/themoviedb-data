He will attempt to penetrate his subject with a series of agile and inquisitive camera movements. Although open to the four winds, the building is presented to us as an impenetrable castle: there are bars on the windows, locks and pulleys: a series of obstacles blocking our access. Lange launches his attack by panning horizontally, then vertically, across the walls; these are scarred with broken windows, which provide the principal motif for the film. This panning movement continues, with a series of variations based on the geometric patterns offered by the half-broken windows: a series of backlit triangles and rectangles, which at times suggest an anthropomorphic motif. The use of different shooting speeds and of in-camera double-exposure causes the film to fluctuate between documentation and abstraction. L'Ailleurs - Somewhere Else - is the interior which the film never penetrates.","popularity":0.0511,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Défénestration vers l'ailleurs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1449517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominik Lange","original_name":"Dominik Lange","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3f195b3dd1260016522c72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
