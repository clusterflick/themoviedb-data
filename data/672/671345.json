We hear from the men and women, who built this engineering marvel. Massive tunnel boring machines gnawed their way through rock and chalk, digging not one tunnel but three; two rail tunnels and a service tunnel. This was a project that would be privately financed; not a penny of public money would be spent on the tunnel. Business would have to put up all the money and take all the risks. This was also a project that was blighted by flood, fire, tragic loss of life and financial bust ups. Today, it stands as an engineering triumph and a testament to what can be achieved when two nations, Britain and France put aside their historic differences and work together.","popularity":0.5874,"poster_path":"/d9sGAQU4gplhFu0AkMujo4IwYvC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8635,"logo_path":"/sNC3eCDuMbNhRCevAUIYbblJOjO.png","name":"Windfall
