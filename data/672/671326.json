He hates his job and people seem to treat him badly. Desperate and dejected -- Diego feels he isn't \"Truly living\" and must somehow make a move to regain meaning to his life. Reading about the great painter Paul Gauguin, Diego emulates the artist and leaves the comfort of his world for a place he can live cheaply and paint full time. His destination -- Juarez Mexico. But dreams can come at a price and Diego is forced to come to terms with what \"truly living\" means when one has to survive and escape with one's own life.","popularity":0.129,"poster_path":"/q6SWBLr6zMaturFngGJEH6Fyl25.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living Gauguin","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2500526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nomar Rizo","original_name":"Nomar Rizo","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6624d35262f335014bd7a524","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3961877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moy Hinojos","original_name":"Moy Hinojos","popularity":0.0521,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6624d3597a97ab017d8db3a5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4665980,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Juan Galceran","original_name":"Juan Galceran","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6624d34bb9a0bd017ad5ebcd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6079114","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q6SWBLr6zMaturFngGJEH6Fyl25.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
