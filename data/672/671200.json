We get to follow some aerobics instructors on a crusade against hetero-sexism. Like a homoerotic meeting between Jane Fonda and Ulrike Meinhof. The film encourages and gives suggestions for ways to respond to gender-and hetero-fascists and their constant repetition of for example, are you a guy or girl? A movie for all of us who are faced with sexism, trans / homophobia and guitar guys on everyday occasions and at parties.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/1hhLhNJ3TJSbyE2E9SBfYU74avn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moralist Instruction Musical: The Revolutionary Conduct","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612237,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lasse Långström","original_name":"Lasse Långström","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3fca6b41465c0018cb4145","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1766070","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1hhLhNJ3TJSbyE2E9SBfYU74avn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
