Motion painting, introspective photography and the closing of a personal episode, it is a game of images in which abstractness enters the sensible reality of body and vice versa. In its dark journey from the brain to the heart there is no logic. It is a requiem for someone that doesn't already exists - as I remember her - that may be just lived in my memory and that now lives shrouded in these images. As it was being made, the method used was more in common with the development of a painting or a poem, in which time and chance influence in many ways. (...) The influence of the \"cineplastica\" and the first avant-gardes is a constant of the work.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Memoriam","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2533073,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jorge Cosmen","original_name":"Jorge Cosmen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3f1cfa81c7be001c3036a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
