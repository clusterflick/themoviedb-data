For 10 days Oriana Fallaci waited in the holy city of Qum for her interview with the 79 year old Ayatollah, who is the de facto ruler of Iran. On Sept. 12, she was led into the Faizeyah religious school, where Khomeini holds his audiences. She was accompanied by two Iranians Nyho and Iran prime minster Banisadr who had helped set up the interview and who served as translators. Oriana Fallaci, barefoot, enveloped in a chador, the head to toe veil of the Moslem woman, was seated on a carpet, when the Ayatollah entered, and the recorded interview could begin.","popularity":0.6962,"poster_path":"/1auwRfUddY59pfQvjVJw5rOxqdB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/gKP4egMJOi5rksdnplfPV1wa0sd.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1979-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oriana Fallaci intervista Ayatollah Khomeini","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174426,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oriana Fallaci","original_name":"Oriana Fallaci","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/j9C30lxPrNJTZErM6aSck7mc6OC.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5e40e0510c2710001a7ffa6f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2311386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruhollah Khomeini","original_name":"Ruhollah Khomeini","popularity":0.1235,"profile_path":"/g2Dy4thgeYQ02bsA8hsbZb34B4l.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e40e05b9603310019eeb1ef","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2534178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abolhassan Banisadr","original_name":"Abolhassan Banisadr","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e40e0819603310017eea334","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174426,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oriana Fallaci","original_name":"Oriana Fallaci","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/j9C30lxPrNJTZErM6aSck7mc6OC.jpg","credit_id":"5e40e09141465c0016cc98fc","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174426,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Oriana Fallaci","original_name":"Oriana Fallaci","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/j9C30lxPrNJTZErM6aSck7mc6OC.jpg","credit_id":"5e40e0a70c271000187eabe0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11756390","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/22KVBDAq09GRPwxiihqHS14i8n.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1auwRfUddY59pfQvjVJw5rOxqdB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2020,"name":"revolution"},{"id":187,"name":"islam"},{"id":234154,"name":"iranian revolution"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
