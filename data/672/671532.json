Therefore an invitation to the Women's World Cup in Taipei went to the reigning club champions from the small town of Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. In the film the former players talk about the absurd conditions in which they had to fight for their great dream of playing football. Accompanied by historical footage - testimonies of a men's world that today seem all the more anachronistic - the film tells a story that is about much more than sporting success, namely equality and recognition.","popularity":0.0434,"poster_path":"/6NpssRmJrUdohcNjUQtOYZZwiUu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101509,"logo_path":"/al4qRaI9Vet4CXbeqI0DE0KnIdl.png","name":"CORSO Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Wanted More: The Miracle of Taipei","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","title":"El milagro de Taipei","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"We wanted more: el milagro de Taipei","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2100917,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Martin Roelly","original_name":"Martin Roelly","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dc582acb9f4b004742465c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1006849,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Erik Winker","original_name":"Erik Winker","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60dc58346c449c002de3786c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477944,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John David Seidler","original_name":"John David Seidler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e4129360c2710001a804de1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2477944,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John David Seidler","original_name":"John David Seidler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e41293f9603310015ef5d79","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11582758","wikidata_id":"Q83470777","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rnxzQD4irJp5RM6ICOl6qZa6J69.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/6NpssRmJrUdohcNjUQtOYZZwiUu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2019-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
