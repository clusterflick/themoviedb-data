The film explores various different aesthetic options. Lange begins by filming a bare tree, magnifying it and giving it the plastic seductivity of a watercolour in movement. The shots of the tree, either gently caressed by the artist's camera or exploding in a multitude of trembling and scratched forms, alternate with a series of shots of depressing new public-housing tower blocks. Lang revitalizes these buildings by clustering them together and/or blurring their contours. At a certain point, a building site appears; we see the buildings under construction, with construction workers busy at their task. Were these shots filmed later, or did the film-maker choose to show them later? It doesn't really matter; the alchemical phenomenon which mutates vegetation (nature) into the depressing uniformity of tower blocks is conveyed with sensitivity.","popularity":0.0819,"poster_path":"/240rDm3ESGUhs0bvezeSt3TZ7xR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Béton armé contre dame nature","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1449517,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dominik Lange","original_name":"Dominik Lange","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3f19be0c2710001a7d011b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/240rDm3ESGUhs0bvezeSt3TZ7xR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
