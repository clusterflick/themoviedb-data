They feel their culture and language is threatened and is the main reason for the many suicides among young people. But the Danish speaking Greenlanders feel discriminated and want to keep the ties to Denmark. The film follows four strong young Greenlanders, who each in their own way insist on taking responsibility for the future of their country. The documentary explores the difficult balance between the right to self-determination and xenophobic nationalism. Between traditional culture and globalization.","popularity":0.2417,"poster_path":"/e76ofiZhMvIf4BheYbgm67B9XHa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128701,"logo_path":null,"name":"Copenhagen Film Company Short & Doc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"GL","name":"Greenland"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2020-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"Kalaallisut","iso_639_1":"kl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fight for Greenland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2094819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josef Tarrak-Petrussen","original_name":"Josef Tarrak-Petrussen","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"665f395946dca91b8120e46b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4754838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tillie Martinussen","original_name":"Tillie Martinussen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"665f39b1541697b16e6583f8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4754840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kaaleeraq M.
