The film was released in 1930 as one of the last silent films under the powerful title SENSATION IM DIAMANTENCLUB. The screenplay was based on motifs from Hoffmann's story 'Das Fr채ulein von Scuderi' (1819), which is considered the first crime story in German. Director Hans Br체ckner mixes some elements of the genre in his crime film, the palette ranges from classic 'Whodunit' to detective to elements of horror film, focuses on shadows, lighting effects, cross-fading according to German and drastic wrestling matches based on the American pattern. As a 'modern' script idea, the dissociative movement disorder, i.e. the psychological paralysis of a victim in shock, impresses a motif that will later prove to be indispensable for the horror repertoire.","popularity":0.0621,"poster_path":"/v28sc5ilp7ekq3gLZAUHN5jd3zx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1930-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jewels","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71648,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Beregi Sr.","original_name":"Oscar Beregi Sr.","popularity":0.1016,"profile_path":"/ktBvBRP1d2s3YsVd2osbr1f5hwX.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e3f7b470c271000137c4004","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2533264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Sorell","original_name":"Maria Sorell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5e3f7b340c271000187cb54e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2533265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beate Tyrolt","original_name":"Beate Tyrolt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5e3f7b3b3dd126001852a2b1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2533266,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Critico","original_name":"Alexander Critico","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e3f7b410c271000157c7606","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2533263,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Br체ckner","original_name":"Hans Br체ckner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e3f7b150c271000137c3fdd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1686881","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2787,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/v28sc5ilp7ekq3gLZAUHN5jd3zx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1858}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1930-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
