On top of managing your own fears and expectations, you feel obliged to wear a brave face for your loved ones. Dani brings such a conversation to life, as 30-year old Danielle delivers her grim breast cancer prognosis to her mother. A story that's as unique and personal as it is disturbingly universal.
