Lawrence, their guide, explains that it is a staged stunt for their benefit; Stewart confirms this and refunds the losses but writes to his old pal Jeff Morgan, a former gunfighter, telling him of his predicament. Morgan sends his son, Jeff, Jr., a superb rider and dead shot but otherwise an awkward lout; at the insistence of Pauline, Stewart places Jeff in charge of a camping party. Laura Mayhew, a city girl in league with Lawrence, sends up a flare signal at night, and while Jeff chases some bears into the woods, Lawrence and his men hold up the camp.","popularity":0.4543,"poster_path":"/etpoentAqw5tsYKZ1kdAxiGZixL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/3wwjVpkZtnog6lSKzWDjvw2Yi00.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man in the Saddle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":538370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hoot Gibson","original_name":"Hoot Gibson","popularity":0.5064,"profile_path":"/gtDdTrKTNy26xJVUeJpdFmZvZWf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jeff Morgan Jr.","credit_id":"5ed3cfa85c071b001c2de48a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100804,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Hill Mailes","original_name":"Charles Hill Mailes","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/At3GtUXi9WLKero09JGxxVCY6Ph.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Jeff Morgan Sr.","credit_id":"5ed3cfb6fea0d7001f888176","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1182922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clark Comstock","original_name":"Clark Comstock","popularity":0.0747,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Pete","credit_id":"5ed3cfc45c071b001e314f55","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3242,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fay Wray","original_name":"Fay Wray","popularity":0.5033,"profile_path":"/zE36ekZdFQ53Bvk5JauwIeOeKlR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Pauline Stewart","credit_id":"5ed3cfd3fea0d7001e89059f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1312722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Long","original_name":"Sally Long","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/cCXOdPhNPimWOD4Kq7UVieYdRkb.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Laura Mayhew","credit_id":"5ed3cfe2aaec7100216bcd30","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1121713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmett King","original_name":"Emmett King","popularity":0.0997,"profile_path":"/yaTj2EfiT8MZgId3JK36cY10otg.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Yom Dyresty","credit_id":"5ed3cfefaaec71001f6e52bc","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lloyd Whitlock","original_name":"Lloyd Whitlock","popularity":0.1725,"profile_path":"/d40IzxpR4hFo7la0UB0whpYu1up.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Lawrence","credit_id":"5ed3cffefea0d7001f8881d7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1079037,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duke R.
