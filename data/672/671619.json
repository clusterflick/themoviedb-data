Gordon, disguised as Hayne, meets with the criminals and manages to purloin the stolen code but the real Hayne, who the police have failed to apprehend, gives chase.  Gordon escapes in a taxi that had been pre-booked to take Hayne to church to marry Celia.  Arriving at the church, and remembering his instructions ‘Let Nothing Hinder You’, Gordon allows himself to be married to Celia while planning how he will escape.","popularity":0.1965,"poster_path":"/hqsKaXteb9o3Y0SZqx9iajVcL33.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37904,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jesse D.
