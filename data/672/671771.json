In LOADED GUN: Life, and Death, and Dickinson, stumped filmmaker Jim Wolpaw uses a decidedly unorthodox approach to create a documentary about the writer whose beautiful, haunting and cryptic poetry has never quite squared with her reputation as a sensitive spinster. Wolpaw's efforts to illuminate this ethereal subject - more than 150 years after her death - yield some hilariously frustrating results.","popularity":0.6882,"poster_path":"/mmDa5SpqDPDa1axffznnBAbfL22.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loaded
