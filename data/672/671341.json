A couple and three individuals talk about their sex lives, about commitments and failures, about their relationships to their bodies, about their passions and love in a society where homosexuality is still punished by imprisonment. The video uses light to produce a white veil that obstructs seeing, hence rendering character identification almost impossible. Through this obstruction, the video locates itself within a specific social context.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":"/iC7YBjt2aTyjuga3hPtyZjtFWPc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How I Love You","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akram Zaatari","original_name":"Akram Zaatari","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e404a6c9603310019edc521","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akram Zaatari","original_name":"Akram Zaatari","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e404a4b9603310013ed9deb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2533688,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michelle Tyan","original_name":"Michelle Tyan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e404a7d9603310015ee4785","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1167103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Akram Zaatari","original_name":"Akram Zaatari","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e404a639603310015ee4771","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iC7YBjt2aTyjuga3hPtyZjtFWPc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
