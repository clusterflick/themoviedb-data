Three years later, Phillip Rowland, a young aristocrat, falls in love with Florette. When Edith intrudes in her affairs, Florette--although she fears unhappiness will result because of their differing social positions--decides to marry Rowland regardless of the consequences. Rowland stands by his wife, although she is snubbed by his family, but when Edith conspires with Walter Stanley to place Florette in a compromising position, Judge Rowland accepts circumstantial evidence as truth and plans for a divorce. Florette, however, cleverly puts her brother-in-law on the defensive; making amends, he has her reinstated in the family's good graces. A lost film.","popularity":0.3758,"poster_path":"/gOY9bVE9T502BZcpT9TeBqGeyfm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Evidence","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1376605,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elaine Hammerstein","original_name":"Elaine Hammerstein","popularity":0.0634,"profile_path":"/dfMgGhj8qRj2jiITIQ0BBGYduho.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Florette","credit_id":"62e57645e86017006254f341","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1047143,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niles Welch","original_name":"Niles Welch","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":"/tJnAKEZX2bwKtgfnGCFvNLrW0Qg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Phillip Rowland","credit_id":"62e576551ad93b0061530b9a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holmes Herbert","original_name":"Holmes Herbert","popularity":0.2176,"profile_path":"/oCvbtPpsOEdrFLR6be8qkRfOZ3x.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Judge Rowland","credit_id":"62e57663eb64f100649864d8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Constance Bennett","original_name":"Constance Bennett","popularity":0.3584,"profile_path":"/hi8BAIa1Ng0b48MJ20t7JdcMEY8.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Edith","credit_id":"5e3f028998f1f100140f56f7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Burke","original_name":"Marie Burke","popularity":0.0716,"profile_path":"/6BN5PXZsScoZGiPMp9EYN011CRO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Mrs. Bascom","credit_id":"62e5767b1749730058300ae8","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3643255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matilda Metevier","original_name":"Matilda Metevier","popularity":0.1032,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Louise","credit_id":"62e576866d9fe800613438f2","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":935649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernest Hilliard","original_name":"Ernest Hilliard","popularity":0.1356,"profile_path":"/yH2Kpkp5ycD1LBzRiy1iBBVjiS2.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Walter Stanley","credit_id":"62e57696eb64f1005e404911","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3643257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Noble","original_name":"Ann Noble","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62e576ddeb64f10064986503","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1307586,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John W.
