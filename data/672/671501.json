The one hour documentary combines an observational filmmaking style with elements of a travelogue and engagement of action sport. Set just after the summer solstice, the team faces rapidly changing road and weather conditions as they push forward against the 72 hour time limit. The film explores the motivations of amateur athletes pursuing a massive physical challenge and considers the role adventure plays in contemporary life.","popularity":0.2788,"poster_path":"/kk98Kqv9cWcKD8qu3OW8zbtEjKX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"sisu","title":"Sisu","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3184687,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jon Mercer","original_name":"Jon Mercer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b739fbb1f68d00ae33a845","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11184428","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kk98Kqv9cWcKD8qu3OW8zbtEjKX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":674}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2020-02-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
