It deals with the topic of implacability of human optimism and fantasy. In a sad manner it tells us a humorous story of a man living double life: one of a beaten little clerk, humiliated by his arrogant boss, imperious wife and misbehaved descendant; the other of a spoiled hero of a dream empire full of beautiful and tender women, flowers and fantastic figures. From artistic point of view is the film based on Adolf Born's lithographs.","popularity":0.2847,"poster_path":"/oNjZd2eVpBffkOqKyg9XsHQpmIX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Krátký film Praha – Studio Bratři v
