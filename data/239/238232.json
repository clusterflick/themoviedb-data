It is respected by climbers around the world. Distilled examines what makes the climbing here so potent.  Andy Cave first climbed in Scotland as a teenager. This was the start of a lifelong journey for Andy, which took him from the depths of a Yorkshire coal mine to the peaks of the Himalayas. As the story unfolds we see dramatic footage of Andy climbing some of Scotland’s classic and most challenging winter routes in the full spectrum of conditions that Scotland’s mountains can conjure.  Distilled is a celebration of Scottish winter climbing and a poignant profile of a life spent in the mountains.","popularity":0.2624,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hot Aches","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The spirit of the great mountains distilled into a Scottish day out.","title":"Distilled","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272630,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andy Cave","original_name":"Andy Cave","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fe4e78c3a36847f82920ed","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1093767,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Diffley","original_name":"Paul Diffley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e78c3a36847f82920f3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":388,"name":"scotland"},{"id":8624,"name":"climbing"},{"id":159212,"name":"mountain climbing"},{"id":209443,"name":"ice climbing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"'Distilled' Trailer, Scottish winter climbing with Andy Cave","key":"79RcZ1ScwV8","published_at":"2014-01-11T13:48:11.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"54a97cda9251414d63004a84"}]}}}
