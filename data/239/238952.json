Reviews its history and famous visitors; displays its faux-exotic buildings, its crowded beaches, its trees and monuments; and, pokes fun at the colors women wear and the vagaries of fashion. The film celebrates the use of \"Eden\" as a place name, suggesting that paradise comes to the coast after all are gone, perhaps only on a remote island beach.","popularity":0.6688,"poster_path":"/5bETPcUHBEPsSuNxquiisAs2uUv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6116,"logo_path":"/yCu2D15iD7lcYsBWqXjU65U9nkH.png","name":"Argos
