On the way we prepare by taking to the track at Monza – the home of Italian Formula One. We try to get noticed on the road course in Monaco in a Bugatti, a Lamborghini and a Model T Ford. After cruising the canals in Venice we take to the tarmac and things look good - thanks to the Ferrari F12 Berlinetta and Mercedes SLS Black. Throw in a Pagani Huayra, Porsche Cayman S and a GT3 as well as the Aston Martin Vanquish centenary edition, Bentley V8 convertible, Rolls Royce Phantom coupe and the face-bending BAC Mono all seems pretty perfect to us.","popularity":0.8872,"poster_path":"/xqgjNxenML4ISLuXZMKMKqd1Tnf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Seven days, more than 1,000 miles, 20 cars, two boats, a motorbike and one dream...The Perfect Road Trip.","title":"Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip","video":false,"vote_average":6.846,"vote_count":78,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Top Gear The Perfect Road Trip","type":"English"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Clarkson","original_name":"Jeremy Clarkson","popularity":0.8334,"profile_path":"/8tnYaTYfbSzmGyHeEeBCoNUzCdZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jeremy Clarkson","credit_id":"52fe4e78c3a36847f82920fd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82658,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Hammond","original_name":"Richard Hammond","popularity":0.755,"profile_path":"/3H4Qz0Fpn36BBpS8kiY2gIpezZs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Richard Hammond","credit_id":"52fe4e78c3a36847f8292101","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ben Collins","original_name":"Ben Collins","popularity":0.2026,"profile_path":"/wD2YERFOIqmZlf5KRxyTR6GFAWa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Stig","credit_id":"60c90482f12cf4002932d5cb","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148497,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Phil Churchward","original_name":"Phil Churchward","popularity":0.0837,"profile_path":"/dFxstWbplR2vb5GqHnX6o9obNZ5.jpg","credit_id":"58d42c289251411fd50192b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3258142","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u8yPRoCAhCzLKhqI2h4U6kOqWMt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w3o3N55rPOCDPLNFGrRNtpZLBwP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":1617,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gYFDWCIjxNLGJLtGTqRZkejEyla.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2880},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/u1Iz5anL6x7UzvhFxYUNN0T6Faf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/13ake2MnRw9RZkOt2xrf4QuztDm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xqgjNxenML4ISLuXZMKMKqd1Tnf.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cIcQ4ulNQSCnM0VvyMORlCRjKl2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ov45LKIFPmS1HNuXDq7MNsGKh5f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Perfect Road Trip | Top Gear DVD Trailer","key":"Qy7pOMM5yX0","published_at":"2013-11-15T14:08:27.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"533ec723c3a368544800b7ae"}]}}}
