It is a journey from the superficial materialism of the new young Indian middle class to the universal mysticism of Buddhism. The otherworldly landscape becomes inseparable from the cosmic power of the physical and mystical universe as she discovers her own spirituality and a sexuality beyond the physical, led and mentored by a young khempo, or lay Buddhist monk vital, verbose, funny, and a fountain of cosmic truths. The Last Monk is part of a growing movement in Indian cinema, approaching the societal and spiritual issues raised by todays rapidly-changing India.","popularity":0.1733,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2006-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Monk","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vikrant Chandola","original_name":"Vikrant Chandola","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"himself","credit_id":"52fe4e7cc3a36847f8293589","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Op Dimri","original_name":"Op Dimri","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Concierge","credit_id":"52fe4e7cc3a36847f829358d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272910,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimeesh Gandhi","original_name":"Jimeesh Gandhi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Pushkar","credit_id":"52fe4e7cc3a36847f8293591","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonam Stobgias Gorky","original_name":"Sonam Stobgias Gorky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Sonic","credit_id":"52fe4e7cc3a36847f8293595","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Narendra Joshi","original_name":"Narendra Joshi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Hotel Manager","credit_id":"52fe4e7cc3a36847f8293599","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dheeraj Kushwa","original_name":"Dheeraj Kushwa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Muraad","credit_id":"52fe4e7cc3a36847f829359d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samsthan Lden","original_name":"Samsthan Lden","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Administrator","credit_id":"52fe4e7cc3a36847f82935a1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272915,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Papon","original_name":"Papon","popularity":0.2199,"profile_path":"/5XRRCqBEZdXWySpeD8fHfyTBl2U.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"himself","credit_id":"52fe4e7cc3a36847f82935a5","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rashaana Shah","original_name":"Rashaana Shah","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Swapna","credit_id":"52fe4e7cc3a36847f82935a9","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272917,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sudipto Sen","original_name":"Sudipto Sen","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e7cc3a36847f82935b5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1272917,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sudipto Sen","original_name":"Sudipto Sen","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e7cc3a36847f82935af","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0816206","wikidata_id":"Q20814819","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
