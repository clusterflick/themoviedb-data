The director is accused, the motive is jealousy, but the film is the alibi. As film director Franz declares his love for Ilse, his star actress, she bluntly rejects him. Movie star Ferdinand overhears the private exchange of words and can’t resist a few well-meaning jokes which infuriate Franz. When Ferdinand is found murdered the following morning, Franz thus becomes the prime suspect. Ilse is the only one who believes that Franz is innocent. And she might know a film reel that can prove it.
