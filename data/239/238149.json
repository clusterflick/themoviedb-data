Clara Wieth starred in the title role of the Vampire Dancer, which is just what she was: a dancer performing her seductions on-stage. Off-stage, the young girl is kindhearted and a bit naïve. The lustful dance, during which Robert Dinesen succumbs to the dancer’s fatal charms, remained the centerpiece of the film, which was a popular success and made Wieth an international star.","popularity":0.1847,"poster_path":"/4htd8PkXukMpefuNj5bTlwUemTu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":235,"logo_path":"/obOynoztBEhDNfHsDXBqOuQLAZk.png","name":"Nordisk Film Denmark","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1912-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Vampire Dancer","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Wampyyritanssijatar","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89676,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clara Pontoppidan","original_name":"Clara Pontoppidan","popularity":0.0889,"profile_path":"/k5yBFjxpOQCtTKG3UF9pkOKBEF.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Silvia Lafont, the Vampire Dancer","credit_id":"52fe4e76c3a36847f8291ad5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268659,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Seemann","original_name":"Henry Seemann","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/3tpFxXkIKtAfJzt0byPqY99llhI.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Count von Waldberg","credit_id":"52fe4e76c3a36847f8291ad9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Dinesen","original_name":"Robert Dinesen","popularity":0.1076,"profile_path":"/aDHiw3szuuKfhE0ccIQzkEX8aGt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Oscar Borch","credit_id":"52fe4e76c3a36847f8291add","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederik Jacobsen","original_name":"Frederik Jacobsen","popularity":0.063,"profile_path":"/qh07avCB5lZXqdpUwYAuZzKOGv5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Servant","credit_id":"52fe4e76c3a36847f8291ae1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingeborg Bruhn Bertelsen","original_name":"Ingeborg Bruhn Bertelsen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/f3pKoPv9uVIVx1nSIUyi3p6SfwN.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e76c3a36847f8291ae5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":579007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Svend Bille","original_name":"Svend Bille","popularity":0.0622,"profile_path":"/2jIgire79iWMPed6fshuTFqoCi8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e76c3a36847f8291ae9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268298,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Axel Boesen","original_name":"Axel Boesen","popularity":0.0588,"profile_path":"/98qSLGSo1XPlPzFF0z0g9StvFBO.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e76c3a36847f8291aed","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederik Christensen","original_name":"Frederik Christensen","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":"/w8sp1HLa2uYc26tnuIOQlNOiR9q.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e76c3a36847f8291af1","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Henriksen","original_name":"Julie Henriksen","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e76c3a36847f8291af5","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1272543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanne Krum-Hunderup","original_name":"Johanne Krum-Hunderup","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e76c3a36847f8291af9","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Lagoni","original_name":"Otto Lagoni","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4e76c3a36847f8291afd","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1272527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"H.C.
