For some reason, he believes that his larcenous ways will bring him prosperity in the country which at one time or another has had rulership over a large portion of the globe. While there, he meets Rosie McCratchit (Pamela McMyler), a lovely Irish gal who could do with some improvement in her fortunes as well. Together, they have a series of legal, quasi-legal and definitely illegal adventures, including Duke's cow-roping and Rosie's response to the mud-wrestling challenge of the Amazon Lady, as well as an attempted armored-car robbery.","popularity":1.3811,"poster_path":"/duRUmKsl6yFnNWN52yWJBYejKsF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18276,"logo_path":null,"name":"Backstage
