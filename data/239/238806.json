The owner has two sons. One, a handsome seafarer, is in love with a local girl, but cannot marry her due to a long-running feud between their fathers. After a lengthy voyage, he returns with a very exotic, noble Chinese wife, which scandalizes the conservative town. His other son, a \"landlubber\", seeks to convert to steamships, to the disgust of his father. Even worse, he is secretly dealing in contraband.","popularity":0.5938,"poster_path":"/u8KLiutrv1fOV7HHOtdGGuQd9Up.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16046,"logo_path":null,"name":"Associated Talking Pictures (ATP)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1934-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Java Head","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna May Wong","original_name":"Anna May Wong","popularity":0.545,"profile_path":"/qHcm2bt1PU7bLk4osbzp0kQTYl1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Princess Taou Yuen","credit_id":"52fe4e85c3a36847f8295eb1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Allan","original_name":"Elizabeth Allan","popularity":0.2067,"profile_path":"/7qaJPMTLAvNJSBHseWxMBcalYNH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nettie Vollar","credit_id":"52fe4e85c3a36847f8295eb5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Loder","original_name":"John Loder","popularity":0.2374,"profile_path":"/4F6RnLjEuhetDl4qu8QUH3pMrf1.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gerrit Ammidon","credit_id":"52fe4e85c3a36847f8295eb9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edmund Gwenn","original_name":"Edmund Gwenn","popularity":0.3929,"profile_path":"/9xUiHCycn0WsxqiqFjq2fI40FpQ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jeremy Ammidon","credit_id":"52fe4e85c3a36847f8295ebd","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Richardson","original_name":"Ralph Richardson","popularity":0.3925,"profile_path":"/rPGUnz38kKtFfYmmEqVAjqZPA10.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"William Ammidon","credit_id":"52fe4e85c3a36847f8295ec1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Herbert Lomas","original_name":"Herbert Lomas","popularity":0.0975,"profile_path":"/wQWTmeNqaOprEpRdJ4oUPfrely.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Barzil Dunsack","credit_id":"5b533973c3a3680b660127de","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Curzon","original_name":"George Curzon","popularity":0.0786,"profile_path":"/a3QNy1ILqHj99Dd9ZtePXnK7bcJ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Edward Dunsack","credit_id":"5b533980c3a3680b68013b14","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2088844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Marriner","original_name":"John Marriner","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"John Stone","credit_id":"5b53398bc3a3680b6c0102eb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208019,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grey Blake","original_name":"Grey Blake","popularity":0.1207,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Roger Brevard (as Gray Blake)","credit_id":"5b5339979251411f8a00ffb4","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":990435,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Emerton","original_name":"Roy Emerton","popularity":0.165,"profile_path":"/tX0ytOGq3dRDuYEDhFHPT7JjV8d.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Broadrick","credit_id":"5b5339a40e0a26231c011128","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":553484,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Brandon Thomas","original_name":"Amy Brandon Thomas","popularity":0.0472,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":16,"character":"Rhoda Ammidon","credit_id":"5b5339b09251411f7e00fbc7","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":325881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frances Carson","original_name":"Frances Carson","popularity":0.0749,"profile_path":"/9SdirTOaS5Onu1o9fbB3Ha2O122.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Kate Vollar","credit_id":"5b5339bdc3a3680b6c01031d","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":253716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thorold Dickinson","original_name":"Thorold Dickinson","popularity":0.093,"profile_path":"/53dabVh7YOab4aAVUQrqwW7Ja8P.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e85c3a36847f8295ea7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96255,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"J.
