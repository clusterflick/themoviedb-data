He marries a charming young woman, tenderly in love, who proves incapable of holding him back and, above all, of making him work. But a young American arrives in Paris and reveals that he is the architect's natural son. At first reluctant, the latter and his young wife quickly adapt to the new situation, until the son, a businessman through and through, wants to share with his father his ideas on life, which can be summed up in one sentence: hard work, with no time for pleasure. The father is quick to balk, and the son is forced to unwillingly participate in the fickle architect's nightlife. Eventually, the father is able to settle down, while the son, having acquired a taste for love, has a good time.","popularity":0.1973,"poster_path":"/496ahHeD1Y7ePB3e2TSmfuPxeqh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1953-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Childish Father","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Teynac","original_name":"Maurice Teynac","popularity":0.1694,"profile_path":"/4dhHoCFhYvJceIRDlHB3lEhcnc4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Lucien Landier","credit_id":"65d953c2688cd0018610d70e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1764923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sirena Adgemova","original_name":"Sirena Adgemova","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Yvonne Calabrier","credit_id":"65d953c972d85500c8bb2d26","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Tissier","original_name":"Jean Tissier","popularity":0.1416,"profile_path":"/aAm4MMYrxQOPkUKXegDU5vRHqsL.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Stanley Percheron","credit_id":"65d953d0befd91017d1f3724","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armand Bernard","original_name":"Armand Bernard","popularity":0.099,"profile_path":"/zFh796KeqtYLfI9HaBwlSUWLfml.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Reverend James Holiday","credit_id":"65d953e0dd47e1016227b090","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques François","original_name":"Jacques François","popularity":0.244,"profile_path":"/gEE5ItVCtnRkshyAtgdF02xVeVy.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gérard Morrison","credit_id":"65d953e84e4dff017cb77e21","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3424136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evelyn Nattier","original_name":"Evelyn Nattier","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"65d953f293bd6901628b2c81","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":278688,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arlette Poirier","original_name":"Arlette Poirier","popularity":0.1885,"profile_path":"/tuahRYiUPlJKkS2xTAGfLvBOiNl.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Philippine Opposum","credit_id":"65d953f993bd6901858b5d7b","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":537581,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Seller","original_name":"Robert Seller","popularity":0.2779,"profile_path":"/oLdTDdbLGc3kIBRoWjzd0DOo1HN.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"65d95405befd91017d1f37ed","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3430881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Thierry","original_name":"Mary Thierry","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"65d9540e688cd0018610d873","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3431229,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Wilde","original_name":"Pamela Wilde","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"65d9541bf8aee8017c4068a9","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":544940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Léon Mathot","original_name":"Léon Mathot","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":"/w8DKEwECdiYPAyoSi3PgBkLvQXm.jpg","credit_id":"5be866e00e0a263bf302b456","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0158803","wikidata_id":"Q18414812","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/496ahHeD1Y7ePB3e2TSmfuPxeqh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1953-07-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
