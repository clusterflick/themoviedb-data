She was celebrated very early as a prodigy. At the tender age of five, she was sent by her family from Bucharest to Vienna, and later, under the care of her strict uncle, to Paris to continue her studies. She will suffer from chronic health issues, survive two world wars, anti-Semitism, before having to go into exile in Vevey, Switzerland. That’s where she found the proper support, in the early fifties, to begin the career she deserved for so long, world fame and undeniable recognition.","popularity":0.1336,"poster_path":"/bp5Gnb2ZhLuRLchDAHKEYaHuYsW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129558,"logo_path":null,"name":"Louise Productions","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":16266,"logo_path":"/4BqNNUJgq1wojHPDgL90oL4LW58.png","name":"Seppia","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":16661,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARTE GEIE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2017-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clara Haskil : le mystère de l'interprète","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1339035,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Prune Jaillet","original_name":"Prune Jaillet","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bec2b20c3a3685bf600ad7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2423969,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pascal Cling","original_name":"Pascal Cling","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d95cb04ea4263001294a55a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2248191,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pierre-Olivier François","original_name":"Pierre-Olivier François","popularity":0.0977,"profile_path":"/4pFd0GmmZoFqcSeBlMpDLdNZViw.jpg","credit_id":"5d95cb1d29c6260014870075","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8413288","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1348,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fs6ngSighuDZofXBwen1HjWeg5g.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2397}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bp5Gnb2ZhLuRLchDAHKEYaHuYsW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":683}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"Arte","release_date":"2017-08-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
