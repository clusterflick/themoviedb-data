Marthe, his wife, has left him. His son, little Jacques, sickly and touching, has psychic gifts. Life is not a happy one. A crime is committed. Poor Rambert is unjustly suspected. A good-looking man convinces him to confess his guilt. In doing so, he secures his child's future. Resigned to everything, the sad Rambert is ready for the scaffold. The little medium brings the truth to light and Mme Mortal denounces her husband, Daniel Mortal, the man behind the despicable bargain, as the murderer. Happiness returns with a bang, as the repentant Marthe Rambert continues to watch over little Jacques during the ordeal.","popularity":0.3707,"poster_path":"/2JdIswAv78KTN2o3Gl4wBKcfP68.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2621,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roy
