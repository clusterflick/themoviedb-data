The faces of the four ambitious young artists and their camaraderie are known to all. Their problems, concerns, jokes were run of the mill back then; they remain so even today. Rodolfo’s ill-fated love for Mimi assumes an unexpected tragic dimension given that their tale could be played out in the apartment right next door; right among us.","popularity":0.171,"poster_path":"/e9SCASGhCGNlH5PG4Cj6fytlqkV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greek National
