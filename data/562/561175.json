He dreams of becoming a famous painter. His father-in-law offers him a contract: if he stays in the same job for at least two months, he can devote himself to painting. Under the name of his friend Ravot, Rudy is hired to teach gymnastics at a girls' college. Things soon get complicated. The jealous Lydia, who plays student, keeps an eye on her husband.
