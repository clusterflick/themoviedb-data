On the other hand, his good looks attract beautiful women like Virginie, the star of the Prado, and Anna Risomonti, a fair Italian opera singer. As for Henry, he has designs on young but willful Chantereine, a young singer-actress. But Don Juan soon turns into Romeo and true love unites the couple.

birth.","popularity":0.1616,"poster_path":"/7PTrb0EG3iDxjNXPJgg3aijGWBZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44300,"logo_path":null,"name":"Florida
