If the problem of socialism was time loss—too much bureaucracy, too much conversation, too many meetings—a socialism-on-speed, counting electricity plus statistics, could move past this limit. The film recounts the history of a moment in time when, against all odds, it seemed feasible to plan for the whole system at once—collective ownership of global resources with the programmed and networked efficiency of Wal-Mart.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ivmSeeHNU3Ll4jB54bp1auti8gd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After Scarcity","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1195709,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bahar Noorizadeh","original_name":"Bahar Noorizadeh","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be9e24bc3a368173a049efc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5x4dHsxHPJiJL1zDfAzenOEQoR2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/48arqTqxCGG1ohsfZc1qI5136IC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ivmSeeHNU3Ll4jB54bp1auti8gd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Russian\", \"english_name\"=>\"Russian\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"ru\", \"native_name\"=>\"Russian\"}","note":"","release_date":"2018-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"After Scarcity (Trailer)","key":"294338659","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2018-10-10T11:04:15.000Z","id":"5e3d33f69603310017e938b6"}]}}}
