This is what the film KOMMA explores as a double comma in the German comma word, this interstage of the language that connects the words, and in coma, this between-two of the depths between sleep and death. The camera follows in fixed planes the movement of the fluids and the decomposition of the light spectrum. In this constantly changing topography appear transient forms confronting us with the feeling of ephemeral and metamorphosis.
