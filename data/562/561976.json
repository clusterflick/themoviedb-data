He hopes to triumph over the sarcasm of his prankster comrades and win the hand of his beloved. Onésime has anticipated this by pretending to be a pilot in front of the young girl and her parents. It's true that they are no more barons than Onésime is a pilot, despite what his fiancée Pulchérie has said. The young soldier's efforts are not without their mishaps and setbacks. Yet his faith and tenacity triumphed over all obstacles. He is finally accepted as a pilot, while Pulchérie, through a misunderstanding, becomes an unwilling parachutist and, at the same time, a champion jumper. The deception is uncovered, but what does it matter to the two fiancés, who are joyfully celebrated by the entire Escadrille and can at last look forward to their long-awaited happiness?","popularity":0.4032,"poster_path":"/g1w1KOvdOiWJOsSns58SoI1juBN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1958-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les
