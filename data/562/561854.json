Back in London, he founded a club where he taught the upscale society in self-defense. He combined the most effective martial arts of his time: Canne Vigny, Boxing, Savate and Ju-Jitsu. Barton-Wright became such an early pioneer of mixed martial arts (MMA). He called his self-defense art Bartitsu .  The stick fighting instructor at the Bartitsu Club was Pierre Vigny, who optimized the techniques of classic French stick fighting for self-defense.","popularity":0.4431,"poster_path":"/ip0eyGW0YQ3G2BoH4EtvtD4Sna2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111054,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dembach Mediaworks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":170,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bartitsu - Historic Self-Defense with the Cane after Pierre Vigny","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2171090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Kiermayer","original_name":"Alexander Kiermayer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Instructor","credit_id":"5bec21f5925141025c009a03","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2175557,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christoph Reinberger","original_name":"Christoph Reinberger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Instructor","credit_id":"5bec22120e0a266aaf00a5a4","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tLxjThsTRqYHkS3pWUqJD5FcctD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":2161,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ip0eyGW0YQ3G2BoH4EtvtD4Sna2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":779,"name":"martial arts"},{"id":212,"name":"london, england"},{"id":4678,"name":"stick fighting"},{"id":208328,"name":"training film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2018-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Bartitsu","key":"Bs4lqwpppHI","published_at":"2018-05-14T12:24:30.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"5bec2394c3a3685bfe009f58"}]}}}
