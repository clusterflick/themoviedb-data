After a life of adventure, he was instrumental in resettling tens of thousands of refugees and displaced persons resulting from World War I.

The film ends by reminding moviegoers to think of the plight of contemporary refugees caused by the fighting in Europe.","popularity":1.4281,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Giant of Norway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":167922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Nesbitt","original_name":"John Nesbitt","popularity":0.1696,"profile_path":"/yKGHIGmZ1Lr1pYvpDmBPcOqm0nB.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5bec47580e0a2669aa000753","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lumsden Hare","original_name":"Lumsden Hare","popularity":0.2233,"profile_path":"/xV6xxgFGmnRokzAp4ssjhQPWRg2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Fridtjof Nansen (uncredited)","credit_id":"5bec477b9251414d780008ca","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939737,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hugh Sothern","original_name":"Hugh Sothern","popularity":0.1348,"profile_path":"/25xXyfMfAd812WGuSfSguCticf0.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"(uncredited)","credit_id":"5bec478f0e0a2669aa0007a5","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31764,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edward L.
