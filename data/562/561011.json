Hired as assistant director in a Prisunic at A.O.I., he begins to sell the plane ticket paid for by his new employer. The boat trip cost him a month's delay and legal proceedings for fraud. Panicked, he decides to flee into the bush where he is sometimes the victim, sometimes the hero of his adventure. Finally, Mr. Dupont, returning to a civilized country, finds himself obliged, in order not to risk prison, to agree to return to the service of the director of the Prisunic as a valet. When he leaves this difficult boss, he only finds a job as a sandwich maker in an exotic cabaret. He is forced to disguise himself as a Black man.","popularity":0.1393,"poster_path":"/diwLDhXAnO7XT42eKy7tdDaBa7e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86945,"logo_path":"/bbhicTVTOki2igeQYHEUAoFcbvI.png","name":"Paris-Monde-Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1952-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Crazy Jungle","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Le sorcier blanc","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Monsieur Dupont, homme blanc","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":580228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Caccia","original_name":"Roger Caccia","popularity":0.0791,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62155746323eba006c619f89","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monique Orban","original_name":"Monique Orban","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6215574f813831006e146608","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis de Funès","original_name":"Louis de Funès","popularity":2.0675,"profile_path":"/8R8WVggSEKxxT4n2HRKHjxHrIQZ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"621557553f48330044757468","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Duvaleix","original_name":"Albert Duvaleix","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":"/eZWZY2ZPSXYvD2yH1Ib6faUVVh2.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6215575f0bb076006b75ce2a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3438300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Marsan","original_name":"Richard Marsan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62155769323eba0045083413","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emile Loubet","original_name":"Emile Loubet","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62155776813831006e14666f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3439317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arlette Brandès","original_name":"Arlette Brandès","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"621557790e4fc800441182e1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Marc Tennberg","original_name":"Jean-Marc Tennberg","popularity":0.0917,"profile_path":"/8REr5R83siKnSRYdwhIvJoqjjPi.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6215578544a424001f6621bd","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2173117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claude André Lalande","original_name":"Claude André Lalande","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gqKmHiRlV12jUNsOsBVJcbjAcZQ.jpg","credit_id":"5be7f1bf9251415828014e72","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3863374","wikidata_id":"Q3227317","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/w2plPUtQF5kGy7XXgIvf5z8PR8D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/diwLDhXAnO7XT42eKy7tdDaBa7e.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h5YpCVLJgoUOZM8Wm4IZHO7896E.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
