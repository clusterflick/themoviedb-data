She is looking for a place to stay – with running water and a warm bed. Her husband is in prison. When he gets out, they have big plans: to find a place to stay, to get a job, to stop using, to start a new life. Will they make it? Through their story, the film talks about universal human desires: to be loved and to belong – someplace, with someone. But first we have to love ourselves.","popularity":0.0727,"poster_path":"/koSn2AYyFvwiX26dpyBtG4PZEJG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37020,"logo_path":"/o6XZOvru5b5yuDQ6tc7vP69MBwi.png","name":"Sever & Sever","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2018-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Much Do You Love Yourself?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2014672,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Zlatjan Čučkov","original_name":"Zlatjan Čučkov","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bef41499251415cdd020019","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2173997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Blažin","original_name":"Nina Blažin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5bef41339251415cd901fdf3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2173997,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nina Blažin","original_name":"Nina Blažin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5be9747b0e0a263bf80403df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9074328","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/koSn2AYyFvwiX26dpyBtG4PZEJG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
