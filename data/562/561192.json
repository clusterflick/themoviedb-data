He posed as a buisinessman, won the confidence of the notables and transformed the village in the American style, complete with pin-ups, cowboys and so on. Tourists flocked to the village, but Ulysse's greatest idea was to put the cemetery into operation in the American style, and to attract customers with a splash of advertising. Concessions sold out fast, and everyone wanted their place for eternity... However, administrative obstacles are about to cause a catastrophe that Ulysses will avoid at the last moment.","popularity":0.3062,"poster_path":"/zu6NeBVk0WzlnBoKWMUq7o1ZmJf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1954-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die...
