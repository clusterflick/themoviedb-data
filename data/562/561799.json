Gisèle, suspicious, refuses and disappears. But Pierre finds her and takes her to dinner at Saint-Germain-des-Prés. On the other hand, Gisèle, out of jealousy, goes off on her own to visit \"Paris by Night\", showing us some of the attractions of the \"Moulin Rouge\", \"Naturistes\", \"Rock and Roll\", etc., etc., etc. Pierre pursues her and eventually discovers her hotel. The next day, he takes her for a walk around Paris. They dine at an inn where a supposed car breakdown forces them to spend the night. There was only one room, but the virtuous Gisèle locked Pierre in the bathroom. All ends in the most honest engagement in the world.","popularity":0.3478,"poster_path":"/2SaOLS8DQrMWgelrTdHZAh7aDcC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72944,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gimeno Phillips
