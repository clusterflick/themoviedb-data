For the novice skater just learning, there will be the inevitable bumps and falls. New skaters learn that their skate blades have an inside and outside edge. Basics they learn are how to glide properly and how to stop. Most maneuvers conducted by figure skaters are based on figure eights, figure threes and loops. Other areas of the arts and entertainment mesh with figure skating, such as music, fashion and dance. The most famous professional revue, the Ice Follies, incorporates many other aspects of entertainment into their show beyond the basic ice skating.","popularity":0.2838,"poster_path":"/dtkwSE3OgGxGb9JYn53RV0rlGNn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/usUnaYV6hQnlVAXP6r4HwrlLFPG.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ice Antics","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2175689,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mae Ross","original_name":"Mae Ross","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5bec62c0c3a36859480028a4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2175691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Merifield","original_name":"Pat Merifield","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5bec62d6c3a3685957002bb7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2175693,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phyllis Thompson","original_name":"Phyllis Thompson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5bec62e4c3a3685957002bd3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2175694,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sparky Bourque","original_name":"Sparky Bourque","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bec62f2c3a3685944002af6","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1467127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolphe Hebert","original_name":"Adolphe Hebert","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5bec63040e0a26152c00101f","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73256,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Miller","original_name":"David Miller","popularity":0.1851,"profile_path":"/vqk0qGzQL70LNB02EAECUB0xnj.jpg","credit_id":"5bec631b0e0a266998002916","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0397464","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1590,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dtkwSE3OgGxGb9JYn53RV0rlGNn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1060}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2398,"name":"narration"},{"id":10671,"name":"figure skating"},{"id":157168,"name":"ice skating"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1939-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
