The wails are sporadic- sometimes in the mornings, at others in the evening or night.  There's of course no baby or another human being to be found near the tree.  Is the tree haunted? Does the family have a dark past?  The relatives are called and a ritual is performed.  Do the wails stop? And whose wails were those?  Directed by Ganesh Shetty and produced by Drishyam Films, Paroksh, which means invisible, is said to be inspired by a true story.  Starring Amit Sial, Pooja Upasana and Yateen Karyekar, the film will keep you glued to the screen till its very end with a climax that will leave you partly wondering and partly smiling.","popularity":0.2153,"poster_path":"/kxQ5mgLdbJ22Gnkh5rZZ2r53BFb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68466,"logo_path":"/krPQgLPv9Mbk5NkRfUE3Rx96HwO.png","name":"Drishyam Films","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2016-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Paroksh","title":"Paroksh","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117729,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amit Sial","original_name":"Amit Sial","popularity":0.3525,"profile_path":"/xw5krdySj0LN7KNaOhBiR9Zqrk0.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"64b1361fba48020124342288","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4161850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pooja Upasana","original_name":"Pooja Upasana","popularity":0.0911,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"64b136319672ed0100e28b81","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3474486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yateen Karyekar","original_name":"Yateen Karyekar","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"64b1363b9672ed00aeb43422","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1851222,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ganesh Shetty","original_name":"Ganesh Shetty","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64b1364b2cde9800cb8423cc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6551128","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nkWlcHwhGivyLUwpua2JFPpmzm8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":910,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kxQ5mgLdbJ22Gnkh5rZZ2r53BFb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wAHrk7o0SW0VCEzrNZ7YHfM2df1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":815}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-04-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
