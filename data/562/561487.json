Deposed, he flees and joins the Ghafaris, determined to help his former enemies against the Amiris. Taken prisoner, he is saved by his young slave, Yasmina, while the Ghafaris are almost completely annihilated. He takes refuge on the ship of the trafficker Mordhom. Having provoked the death of his servant, he is put on trial by Mordhom but acquitted by his peers. Mordhom then lands Igricheff on the coast, and the latter succeeds in saving the Frenchman from an Amiri attack. The two men reconcile and set off on their adventures together.","popularity":0.2115,"poster_path":"/oTKmJS7kukEBJtx7pTY86Zq0Fbk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12956,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les
