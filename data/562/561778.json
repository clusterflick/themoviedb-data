Principals Natalia Osipova and Steven McRae dance Ashton's Rhapsody, created for The Royal Ballet in 1980 by Mikhail Baryshnikov and Lesley Collier, with spectacular choreography to suit the dancers' star reputations.  Lauren Cuthbertson and Vadim Muntagirov lead a charismatic cast in Ashton's poignant and heart-warming reflection on Love, The Two Pigeons, based on an old French folk tale and first performed on Valentine's Day 1961.  These two ballets by the Company's Founder Choreographer capture The Royal Ballet's famous skill and distinctive style. Barry Wordsworth conducts the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House in the rapturous Rachmaninoff and Messager scores.","popularity":0.178,"poster_path":"/bJJrSEepC1tAc8bQTAcWu6FVNBC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rhapsody and The Two Pigeons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","title":"狂想曲和两只鸽子","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1281063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Cuthbertson","original_name":"Lauren Cuthbertson","popularity":0.05,"profile_path":"/rhQZRPEORYv9dFYSNREXkVmcbYz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"629a3131d48cee6af44a7081","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olivia Cowley","original_name":"Olivia Cowley","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/iG4IJOMoqWvOcpxf81JhtSNY47z.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"629a313ad71fb416cb7a72a9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1898172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tristan Dyer","original_name":"Tristan Dyer","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"629a3144d48cee6af3904d4c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicol Edmonds","original_name":"Nicol Edmonds","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/dTzGr6TGTaQlzNqI1DZvIA6bNm8.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"629a314bd48cee6af5569e08","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Ella","original_name":"Benjamin Ella","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/5GbU02F3DX3knYE9smYAGVo4MH9.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"629a3153988afd126aab2f67","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Emerton","original_name":"Kevin Emerton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"629a315cd71fb416ca2e7b36","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1436754,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Harrod","original_name":"Elizabeth Harrod","popularity":0.0667,"profile_path":"/y7U4x8OIPF7TK8ev1eKI4He8nuc.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"629a316465e0a211fe2f8bed","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meaghan Grace Hinkis","original_name":"Meaghan Grace Hinkis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/hQUp2wRxS29BrcvMXjNF2MW7LAe.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"629a316b7ad08c00662c865e","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1559914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryoichi Hirano","original_name":"Ryoichi Hirano","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/86cRe0kbI2jawjpjfBuSnwNOTky.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"629a3172a44d095275ecd394","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2533687,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fumi Kaneko","original_name":"Fumi Kaneko","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":"/pcUWdP0PjEkplo7FxGRtEQfRvtj.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"629a317c65e0a211ff446f15","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1897674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Acri","original_name":"Luca Acri","popularity":0.0782,"profile_path":"/dAvr5usOcPWhpUZPcf9A86CEukb.jpg","credit_id":"629a31d865e0a212045a775b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6448226","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1275,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bJJrSEepC1tAc8bQTAcWu6FVNBC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":850}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
