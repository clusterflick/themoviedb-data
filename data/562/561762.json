The piece is titled Andante ma non Tanto (which, crudely translated, means faster, but not too much). They sit in the sumptuous surroundings of the Crush Room at the Royal Opera House, London. Above them suspended by wires, which flick in and out of view as the light catches them, is a ballet dancer.  He is naked apart from shorts and the harness. The dancer rests just above the musicians' heads as they play Tchaikovsky's melancholic piece. The dancer moves rhythmically and slowly, his feet almost brushing their bows as they play. 35mm film. Single-screen projection.","popularity":0.1464,"poster_path":"/zj8jp4RlqOy14XhXiQZ7ovVWoGL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strings","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1137903,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sam Taylor-Johnson","original_name":"Sam Taylor-Johnson","popularity":0.319,"profile_path":"/4iWEBM7B4nANVZcRaID9XHo4tPl.jpg","credit_id":"5beba2390e0a266a9e0019b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1184,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zj8jp4RlqOy14XhXiQZ7ovVWoGL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":789}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
