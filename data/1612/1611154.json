Through the lens of two towering cranes visible from her apartment, she chronicles her adaptation to a new city, the evolution of her identity as a filmmaker, and her growing sense of belonging. Over the course of a year, the cranes become symbols of both stability and transformation, while also reminding her of the complexities of having two countries to call home simultaneously. As Linda's studies conclude and she faces the prospect of returning to Hungary, the cranes echo the closing of this chapter in an increasingly symbolic manner.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qZtReLLajhV3pTK4hIgl1ovpwWn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Cranes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5922514,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Linda Lőrincz","original_name":"Linda Lőrincz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695d4161cac8e7f41d6bdd5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5922519,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"0libl00d","original_name":"0libl00d","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695d428a01a593c1dadd0b84","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5922520,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fürj","original_name":"Fürj","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695d4298cc0979422c64bef7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1530,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qZtReLLajhV3pTK4hIgl1ovpwWn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1084}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
