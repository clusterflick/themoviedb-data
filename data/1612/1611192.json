But now more than ever, humanity’s survival depends upon co-existence with the wild.  Since 1970, the planet has lost 60% of its biodiversity. The most dire consequences are accelerated global warming and a potential mass extinction event affecting millions of plant and animal species. But there is a nascent solution gaining ground: rewilding the planet. Exploring the restoration of iconic species like jaguar, elephant, bison and Pacific salmon, The Rewilders is an intimate, visually spectacular short documentary that tells the tale of pioneering conservationists on three continents, working tirelessly as they galvanize the global movement of rewilding, one animal and landscape at a time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/nibPIWu7OotQKjrfkf01WsQjVqa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rewilders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5922643,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Ritchie","original_name":"John Ritchie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695d521869b5a294ea1793ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5922647,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kyle Gunther","original_name":"Kyle Gunther","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695d5230956119e4da64bf84","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5922648,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Louise Valgardson","original_name":"Louise Valgardson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695d5248fe183c37c1dc2fbe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2186440,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trish Neufeld","original_name":"Trish Neufeld","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695d525e45aadeb1c2029542","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3975290,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marlene Rodgers","original_name":"Marlene Rodgers","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695d526cf00d4a01fe24d30e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nibPIWu7OotQKjrfkf01WsQjVqa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":542}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
