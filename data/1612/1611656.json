More than half a century later, a young poet named K sits at her desk, engulfed in despair. Suddenly, she hears a rose humming.  Responding to the rose’s call, she embarks on an extraordinary journey—moving between daily life and dream—to witness the destinies of poets who have fallen throughout history. A poet’s life may vanish, but poetry endlessly circulates, and a life beyond humanity continues to sing.","popularity":0.0571,"poster_path":"/cCnzZD4eKJ4uHnXU06R5GTm14CN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The No-One’s-Rose","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5924482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Wendy WANG","original_name":"Wendy WANG","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695e88c6cf1f528cc13f5fc0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1914492,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kirtan Hummelen","original_name":"Kirtan Hummelen","popularity":0.0413,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695e891505b3a21406cfd594","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.714,"height":2800,"iso_3166_1":"CN","iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/cCnzZD4eKJ4uHnXU06R5GTm14CN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"8e édition Festival Allers-Retours","release_date":"2026-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
