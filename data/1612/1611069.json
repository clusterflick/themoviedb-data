Everything around him functions as it should, yet something inside him remains strangely still.  When the rain begins to fall, David drifts toward the window, choosing the outside world over the relentless demands of his screen. A phone rings. Emails arrive. Paper stirs in the air. He ignores it all, suspended in a moment that feels heavier than time itself.  A Long Break is a minimalist portrait of emotional absence, of a man who continues to work, breathe, and exist, yet has quietly stepped out of his own life. Told through silence, routine, and the gentle intrusion of rain, the film explores how grief, longing, or unresolved memory can freeze a person in place, even as the world moves on without them.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/zjQpnrPlZ2CzRWLvTQHUeKc8yuU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2024-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some pauses last longer than we expect.","title":"A Long Break","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5710123,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shubhadeep Das","original_name":"Shubhadeep Das","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Him","credit_id":"695d25d1b35fa7157324d163","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5710111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Prithendu Sam","original_name":"Prithendu Sam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tH6SaJ1sNL1oSD8mowoHafeP22N.jpg","credit_id":"695d25fb7bda57fa626bdc55","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5710111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Prithendu Sam","original_name":"Prithendu Sam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tH6SaJ1sNL1oSD8mowoHafeP22N.jpg","credit_id":"695d26087bda57fa626bdc58","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5710111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Prithendu Sam","original_name":"Prithendu Sam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tH6SaJ1sNL1oSD8mowoHafeP22N.jpg","credit_id":"695d2613f00d4a01fe24d204","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5710111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Prithendu Sam","original_name":"Prithendu Sam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tH6SaJ1sNL1oSD8mowoHafeP22N.jpg","credit_id":"695d261efe183c37c1dc2e6d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5710111,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Prithendu Sam","original_name":"Prithendu Sam","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/tH6SaJ1sNL1oSD8mowoHafeP22N.jpg","credit_id":"695d2634793f089df8dd091b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2592,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zjQpnrPlZ2CzRWLvTQHUeKc8yuU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
