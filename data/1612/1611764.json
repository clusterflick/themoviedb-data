They are all still haunted by memories of Moscow, where they led a more interesting, more fulfilling life in a beautiful home. They spend much of their time interacting with soldiers who visit their home, but nothing can erase the memories of a better past. Moscow becomes a symbol of an earthly paradise for them. They want to live, exist, and enjoy every moment, but their dreams and plans are impossible to fulfill. They often pretend to be happy, but they express hidden, passionate feelings and desires to their loved ones.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1106249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrycja Durska","original_name":"Patrycja Durska","popularity":0.1672,"profile_path":"/4qIPRnHmNdoKcfs8ZXpexxaduXd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Olga","credit_id":"695ebd58b87dc1b303c5e954","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1558123,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrycja Soliman","original_name":"Patrycja Soliman","popularity":0.4381,"profile_path":"/1OGsDzgAy8sS7L84F8WdzaJnepm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Masza","credit_id":"695ebd68b67064d91c5081f3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1160250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnieszka Pawełkiewicz","original_name":"Agnieszka Pawełkiewicz","popularity":0.277,"profile_path":"/6mSy84ciJhJ7Bk5NgSz1iuYgvKg.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Irina","credit_id":"695ebe1c43f75db2a68c48ac","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":588610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wojciech Solarz","original_name":"Wojciech Solarz","popularity":0.3632,"profile_path":"/mv6g0fgq9chgVIBc6WOk26H9CJt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Andriej","credit_id":"695ebda2685f1b6d62972b6d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3473045,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Weronika Nockowska","original_name":"Weronika Nockowska","popularity":0.0948,"profile_path":"/2rwaGI0LtbKFJiZamtsJFUdOZ9d.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Natalia","credit_id":"695ebdafc04af7f224c5e9a5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":549375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Krzysztof Stelmaszyk","original_name":"Krzysztof Stelmaszyk","popularity":1.9442,"profile_path":"/ru421L4sdtLbMY9ncxYmbnevGT8.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Fiodor","credit_id":"695ebdbe9c0fb2aedac5e94d","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Borys Szyc","original_name":"Borys Szyc","popularity":0.89,"profile_path":"/uKdIGODaefjjXhFWdjM0whAMLB8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Aleksandr","credit_id":"695ebde59c0fb2aedac5e953","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Agnieszka Glińska","original_name":"Agnieszka Glińska","popularity":0.6858,"profile_path":"/480QOLxIssNpO2Jh4e0hZdknLeW.jpg","credit_id":"695ebe4ffc6ca981a8c5e94e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"2012-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
