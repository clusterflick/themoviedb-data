Grappling with empty-nest feelings, loneliness, and growing emotional distance from her husband Ross, Val begins to realize that her marriage and the woman she once was may be slipping away.  A spontaneous escape to New Orleans to support her pregnant daughter, Kayla, awakens long-buried dreams and passions and introduces her to Peter Mosley, a handsome and charismatic photographer who sees her in ways she has forgotten to see herself. Reawakening her artistic spirit and rediscovering her worth, Val must face a life-altering question: Is it ever too late to choose yourself and the love you truly deserve?","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3431,"logo_path":"/6LVLYfZAEQfhJey0MGvhFXdDEK1.png","name":"Lifetime","origin_country":"US"},{"id":54916,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Butterfly Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":278180,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monami Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":285450,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motion Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":6728,"logo_path":"/2HMc1LNp5BoVSJtM2vHh5UuLXfw.png","name":"Swirl Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Be Happy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141823,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tisha Campbell","original_name":"Tisha Campbell","popularity":2.2444,"profile_path":"/keuc8jAfEM2fRce0P8FvLclwlYg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Val","credit_id":"695d5a3a263f4c8e881794b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mekhi Phifer","original_name":"Mekhi Phifer","popularity":3.5966,"profile_path":"/jCvF0bpi9emIWBnu20MCMU0bwrf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Peter Mosley","credit_id":"695d5a4a14614ea4bb1795b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62649,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Hornsby","original_name":"Russell Hornsby","popularity":1.2963,"profile_path":"/lA2XCK2GgwVoboX3NskkKp5rxOF.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ross","credit_id":"695d5a5da6c95f0d3c24d39a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4266385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zing Ashford","original_name":"Zing Ashford","popularity":0.1351,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Kayla","credit_id":"695d5b76f00d4a01fe24d322","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gabourey Sidibe","original_name":"Gabourey Sidibe","popularity":2.0577,"profile_path":"/d0p0MGqM1GrrnBw4b3V9uM6HCl2.jpg","credit_id":"695d5a2c15a89e977e64bf19","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":84933,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary J.
