What she finds goes far beyond one city - survivors still grappling with loss, systemic failures, and unanswered questions that echo across fire-prone regions on every continent.  As climate-driven wildfires intensify from California to Australia, Southern Europe, and beyond, Maiya’s investigation uncovers an emerging blueprint for wildfire-resilient communities - highlighting innovation, adaptation, and collective action that transcend borders. Both urgent and hopeful, the film offers a timely, internationally relevant roadmap for how societies can prepare for a hotter, more volatile future.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/a6Mv7zd2kDYhjv6In48ci80HD91.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81701,"logo_path":null,"name":"KPBS","origin_country":""},{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":203074,"logo_path":"/vRNPCnFPE1xEhyNpHxLIOzZkjst.png","name":"Balance Media Entertainment","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weathered: After the LA Firestorm","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5310669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maiya May","original_name":"Maiya May","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"695ec8f755422d82234f01ff","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3632080,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Trip Jennings","original_name":"Trip Jennings","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695ec8cf632cf3841d8c48d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a6Mv7zd2kDYhjv6In48ci80HD91.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2026-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
