One protagonist describes her overwhelming feelings, while three other figures appear as aesthetic mirrors of her inner states. In a world that demands perfection and smooth functioning, everyday life continues like a mechanical system even when the inside has long overflowed. The bodies increasingly come under pressure until the structure discharges in synchronous, yet faulty movements. The encounter with an antagonist opens a moment of silent perception and raises the question of whose emotions are actually at work in the space. AKIN reveals a raw, deeply human choreography between adaptation and authentic expression.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No
