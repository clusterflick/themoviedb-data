Set on the riverbanks of rural Wales, Cariad teams up with her owner Lee and seasoned sniffer dog Neo on a mission to uncover signs of otters—an elusive, protected species. But learning to read the land isn’t easy, and Cariad has a lot to prove. With every scent trail and muddy pawprint, she edges closer to becoming a vital part of the conservation team. It’s a story of instinct, training, and finding your place—one sniff at a time.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wfNu0BDjk0VtLvsAtiH3ow1dOlK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Detectorists","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5922749,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sarah-Jane Walsh","original_name":"Sarah-Jane Walsh","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695d613fea991a167f24d2b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wfNu0BDjk0VtLvsAtiH3ow1dOlK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":540}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
