But her death wasn't sudden and accidental. It was the result of gradual poisoning caused by a food system that hides poison in food, normalizing ultra-processed foods, sugar, and industry interests over health. Dr. Carlos Jaramillo, a functional medicine physician and popular science communicator with over 10 million followers, guides us through this profound and moving investigation to answer the key question: Who killed Sofia? In the process, he exposes how thousands of lives are at risk today, victims of a food, health, and economic model that prioritizes profit over life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1exqCP6h0FMX4az6OQf4McIHYm5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72170,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laberinto Cine y Televisión","origin_country":"CO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2025-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"La investigación de una trama criminal de la cual puedes ser la próxima víctima","title":"Who Killed Sofía?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5923477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carlos Jaramillo","original_name":"Carlos Jaramillo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"695dc37b456791fe94a2d7dd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1018909,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marion Nestle","original_name":"Marion Nestle","popularity":0.6082,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"695dc51762a92bc945f28f1e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1543593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Lustig","original_name":"Robert Lustig","popularity":0.2405,"profile_path":"/l7I1QTxuctOlgIM13hAX5pX0XMj.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"695dc524456791fe94a2d7f5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5923481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Schatzker","original_name":"Mark Schatzker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"695dc5374a83987dbe3f5c5b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050808,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pedro Sosnitsky","original_name":"Pedro Sosnitsky","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695dc39ecf1f528cc13f5b78","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2050808,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Pedro Sosnitsky","original_name":"Pedro Sosnitsky","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695dc4a48c3f886968b5df3e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1431388,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alessandro Angulo","original_name":"Alessandro Angulo","popularity":0.0751,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695dc4c11ca3cc30cda2d8c5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1882974,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Diana Camargo","original_name":"Diana Camargo","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695dc4d379e9a60df0f28f12","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3872998,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Esteban Sosnitsky","original_name":"Esteban Sosnitsky","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695dc4ea77479bb97bcea81e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt39046211","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ofvdfJMjAAfKuXAkwtInJUICkux.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1600,"iso_3166_1":"ES","iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/1exqCP6h0FMX4az6OQf4McIHYm5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1119}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2025-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"¿Quién Mató a Sofía? | Tráiler Oficial 🎬 (Película 2025)","key":"85TmALw46uo","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-09-15T20:01:10.000Z","id":"695dca167688c3c026cfd1e0"}]}}}
