Though Shifty remains vigilant, the object (or hyper-object) of his anxiety is never visualized for us. The character circles, loops, and attempts to evade a future event that has yet to take shape. The footage itself alternates from CGI to Super 8 film, shifting from an illustrated world to depictions of a “real” one. This interface gives Shifty a life that extends beyond the digital and merges with our sunlit world away from the keyboard.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taileater","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5923067,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Salim Gree","original_name":"Salim Gree","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"695d8f35230aae5e42415740","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
