Instantly recognisable for its elegant shape and sharp cutting edge, the samurai sword was long one of the most fearsome weapons in the world. Here, its creation is documented in rich detail as a swordsmith and his apprentices hammer, fold and weld to create a near-perfect steel blade in a process that melds expert craftsmanship with Shinto religious ritual. Alongside the workshop footage, Wolfgang uses traditional Japanese woodblock paintings, dolls and the narration of the US actor George Takei (Lt Sulu in Star Trek) to take the audience through the sword’s history – from its mythological origins and into the 20th century, well past the samurai era.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/29T5zVtN1AmkJsVue6uS6w4GdJJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Japanese Sword as the Soul of the Samurai","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Takei","original_name":"George Takei","popularity":2.628,"profile_path":"/kfpkgfcuxcOrw2OCoAyQpPamQVv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"695d8ee749d043ec0acfd055","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1344,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sIePf6fYK2UF1mEs0cuMJ2YcrFN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2389}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.671,"height":2528,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/29T5zVtN1AmkJsVue6uS6w4GdJJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1696}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1969-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A rare glimpse inside a samurai sword workshop | The Japanese Sword as the Soul of the Samurai","key":"_UxL1AxztNg","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-03-30T14:00:34.000Z","id":"695d8fe40880413388a2d744"}]}}}
