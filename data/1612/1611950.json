The dancers represent employees in a workplace that twists into a corporate nightmare, exposing the rigid and dehumanizing nature of the corporate world. Through movement, the film highlights the tension between control and rebellion, questioning the structures that define success and productivity that the workplace outlines for many everyday. with a sharp and unconventional movement vocabulary, MONEY challenges capitalist ideals and the way they shape daily life. The film breaks traditional boundaries, using dance to portray a system that demands conformity while suppressing individuality. Its rebellious undertones push against societal norms, making more room for fun and play.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Money","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5925610,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John
