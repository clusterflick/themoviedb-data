Half  the proceeds from each sale go to the magazine's homeless seller. It is the  run-up to Christmas and his presence is far from welcome inside the posh  new department store, 'Sevens', on Düsseldorf's upmarket shopping street,  the \"Kö\".No sooner does he enter the store than he is shown the door again.  Outside in the open air, the chilliest, darkest places await him.  His is a fate that has become a commonplace occurrence; it is documented  in this film without sentimentality or self-pity.","popularity":0.1202,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2001-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fifty-Fifty","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Fifty-Fifty","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Kern","original_name":"Peter Kern","popularity":0.2074,"profile_path":"/yQMAtwyj2SB3WKSMNfMcaQ2Dqjv.jpg","credit_id":"566946c1c3a36826470002d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0279816","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-02-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
