A a cancer ‘thriver’ rather than ’survivor’, Barbara Hammer rides the red hills of Georgia O’Keefe’s Ghost Ranch in New Mexico, the grassy foothlls of the Big Horn in Wyoming, and leafy paths in Woodstock, New York changing illness into recovery.  The haunting and wondrous music of Meredith Monk underscores and celebrates in this film that lifts us up when we might be most discouraged.","popularity":0.1063,"poster_path":"/nASzsk0gqroEK7TviFaDizo0gBL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Horse Is Not a Metaphor","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6175d8a5a579f90090b2ff0b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","credit_id":"5663ffa79251412ac6007659","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1184106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barbara Hammer","original_name":"Barbara Hammer","popularity":0.1204,"profile_path":"/1YMUsZHPEVqLfxzrvauPulfR1wr.jpg","credit_id":"5663ffb09251412ad9007be3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1303053,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Meredith Monk","original_name":"Meredith Monk","popularity":0.265,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed05d6198f1f1001fec0bf3","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1378260","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.693,"height":2143,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nASzsk0gqroEK7TviFaDizo0gBL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1485}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlinale","release_date":"2009-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
