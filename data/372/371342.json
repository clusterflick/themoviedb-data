His wife Ilona cheats, his son Linus mocks him on the internet, and younger people overtake him in the office. Even the family dog ​​treats the man in his mid-forties with disregard. When a Spaniard brings him his father's ashes in a detergent bottle, along with a message from an inherited apartment in Thailand, Holger sets out. His father Georg left him after reunification and moved away - the only sign of life in the last 20 years: a postcard from the land of smiles. What Holger awaits there exceeds his wildest expectations.","popularity":0.1958,"poster_path":"/tpsyZxHNLGMSibPiO6xVOOroQM7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Herr Lenz reist in den Frühling","video":false,"vote_average":5.667,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8198,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrich Tukur","original_name":"Ulrich Tukur","popularity":0.3785,"profile_path":"/8cRioOXiW0FSN0eWysHWdl4leEf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herr Lenz","credit_id":"566378cd9251412ac6005481","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4618,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steffi Kühnert","original_name":"Steffi Kühnert","popularity":0.2451,"profile_path":"/6hW85ehTO43ypWbRxrpoy6WCfZ1.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Ilona Lenz","credit_id":"566378d79251412ad900588c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Franke","original_name":"Peter Franke","popularity":0.2278,"profile_path":"/f0BHeWRjt5mhZrzedUSmKMoqBFY.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Georg Lenz","credit_id":"566378e09251412d7b005616","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Hopp","original_name":"Max Hopp","popularity":0.3316,"profile_path":"/ahz012zd2ya1A2BQeFRGT72vIPC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ulf Trautmann","credit_id":"56d2f02992514154b60001fe","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1777733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Simon Jensen","original_name":"Simon Jensen","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":"/pnxRlKghtsd7eiD0N4JED9Su5O7.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Linus Lenz","credit_id":"64f3ef957d41aa0138476e52","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":239775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adolfo Assor","original_name":"Adolfo Assor","popularity":0.1015,"profile_path":"/j86mqVuCa75kIEyi3yb8inM1KHf.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Fernando Varinez","credit_id":"64f3eff797a4e600e1a4483b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1689701,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vera Kasimir","original_name":"Vera Kasimir","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Liane","credit_id":"64f3f07297a4e600ac3fab1d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322947,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Alexander Baer","original_name":"Robert Alexander Baer","popularity":0.0741,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Malik","credit_id":"64f3f097700bf700c6e474d8","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":552426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wipawee Charoenpura","original_name":"Wipawee Charoenpura","popularity":0.3555,"profile_path":"/rnIYfEJNyLVxu4BGYuBZvPzvtpR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Salaktjit","credit_id":"64f3f0f297a4e600e1a448e4","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4250088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thanyaluck Lawapawraya","original_name":"Thanyaluck Lawapawraya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Skype Girl","credit_id":"64f3f12f9e458600e38b4965","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4250089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chadanard Poonkham","original_name":"Chadanard Poonkham","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Nuh","credit_id":"64f3f1659e458600e38b498f","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4250090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chananchida Rungpetcharat","original_name":"Chananchida Rungpetcharat","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Luck","credit_id":"64f3f1a997a4e600e1a44961","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":49785,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andreas Kleinert","original_name":"Andreas Kleinert","popularity":0.134,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566378bdc3a3682bd8005d0e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5082298","wikidata_id":"Q26791246","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tpsyZxHNLGMSibPiO6xVOOroQM7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
