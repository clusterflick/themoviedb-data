The attacks of September 11th - not the work of \"bin Laden\" - and the subsequent \"war on terrorism\" are a means through which this is designed to be achieved.  Over more than six hours and with hundreds of illustrations, David Icke also reveals the illusion that is life in this \"physical\" reality. How is the \"world\" a provable illusion - just a lucid dream? How do we create it and how can we change the dream to one that we would like to experience?","popularity":0.3076,"poster_path":"/tKSN5gR14arHAVWDaqHa2LPQdoJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":360,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"David Icke - Secrets of the Matrix","video":false,"vote_average":1.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Icke","original_name":"David Icke","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/7EnvyPE31uujjhOd2Rvl1aMJRs9.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5719b8b392514137ca000cc6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Icke","original_name":"David Icke","popularity":0.1102,"profile_path":"/7EnvyPE31uujjhOd2Rvl1aMJRs9.jpg","credit_id":"5aff882fc3a3687c53001ff3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tKSN5gR14arHAVWDaqHa2LPQdoJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10410,"name":"conspiracy"},{"id":13015,"name":"terrorism"},{"id":161304,"name":"9/11"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-10-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
