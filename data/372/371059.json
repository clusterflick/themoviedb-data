Presented under the brand \"The Color Bar Lounge,\" a cocktail bar in the mythical 1984 Miss General Idea Pavilion, the program is a hybrid of popular television formats […] and infomercial. […] Advertisements for the bar are placed throughout the program; a loaded word choice, full of double-entendres and innuendo, betrays the influence of both Dadaism and consumerism. This collapse of popular and high culture is central to General Idea's agenda, as Felix Partz observes: \"You know, the mass media are like a vast pharmaceutical complex developing new cultural elixirs of an unprecedented intoxication…but art remains a curious and elitist drink. Despite its unique flavor and heady cultural properties, it has never effectively been exploited.\"","popularity":0.0796,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":79259,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Appel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Test Tube","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1649991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"AA Bronson","original_name":"AA Bronson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5787614a92514137c9004434","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1649993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Felix Partz","original_name":"Felix Partz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"578761b7925141384100447c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1649994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jorge Zontal","original_name":"Jorge Zontal","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"578761cec3a36850c2004bd8","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1060565,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Abramović","original_name":"Marina Abramović","popularity":0.2952,"profile_path":"/acyUmjRy0bLQgHk8Utpg88oCwAl.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"57878317c3a36850c200588f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":211105,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Titus Muizelaar","original_name":"Titus Muizelaar","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":"/jjanaWB7X7NMZwyrdY4SB3xeoyo.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"578784c192514112d7005b65","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1650048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wies Smals","original_name":"Wies Smals","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"57878535c3a36871c90053e1","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"General Idea","original_name":"General Idea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56609d8092514179180040d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1491635,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"General Idea","original_name":"General Idea","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56609d8fc3a36875e900468a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1650049,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Frits Oostvogel","original_name":"Frits Oostvogel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5787856c92514138130050ac","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":14893,"name":"art"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
