Opposing them is Henry Waterman, publisher of the Rio Blanco Herald. He and his assistant, Andrew Jackson Weems, send for the help of the Territorial Rangers. One of the dispatched Rangers is Jeff Lanning who, unknown to him, has a brother as a member of the gang under an assumed name of Bob Mitchell. Jeff is so shocked at seeing his brother gun down Waterman that he is unable to act in time to prevent it. Unable to explain the cause of is inaction, he is suspended by the governor. Unable to persuade his brother to quit the gang, Jeff, with the aid of Weems and Waterman's daughter Carol, begins his quest to bring the outlaws to justice.","popularity":1.0842,"poster_path":"/zXWAw0EBSrYhFdqlw4oju4tdBL1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The West's Toughest Ranger Takes A Lone Stand Against The Desperate \"Bryson Gang\"","title":"South of Rio","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":179130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monte Hale","original_name":"Monte Hale","popularity":0.1526,"profile_path":"/lnWpg7Ds1WsHhzt7QLpvBJXaUo4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Jeff Lanning","credit_id":"5669b64bc3a368535a000f61","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1065018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kay Christopher","original_name":"Kay Christopher","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":"/9jfoZrKqUCXlzdJF0VEeM0IfKJP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Carol Waterman","credit_id":"5669b65c925141741100611f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Hurst","original_name":"Paul Hurst","popularity":0.3319,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Andy Weems","credit_id":"5669b66992514173fc0063a1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Barcroft","original_name":"Roy Barcroft","popularity":0.3467,"profile_path":"/57EKCVAOfcNKNNcHBtkmp0cU9od.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lon Bryson","credit_id":"5669b676925141664f001a3c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95734,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Douglas Kennedy","original_name":"Douglas Kennedy","popularity":0.5522,"profile_path":"/rXmt0reqta0P8FEXhdjDBC0Zprn.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Henchman Bob Mitchell","credit_id":"590f905fc3a36864fc025315","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Haggerty","original_name":"Don Haggerty","popularity":0.356,"profile_path":"/yTJOUx7p8df44KM6EOChmC1NSIy.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Chuck Bowers","credit_id":"590f906cc3a36864c6025011","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95733,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rory Mallinson","original_name":"Rory Mallinson","popularity":0.1489,"profile_path":"/rUGV5zHGkCXTH66S5trWX0BlqCd.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Captain Dan Brennan","credit_id":"590f90799251414e89026125","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":160930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lane Bradford","original_name":"Lane Bradford","popularity":0.4625,"profile_path":"/mRn7rr4JK2AuLeQrau6vVmjYJcN.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Henchman Tex","credit_id":"590f90909251414e80025cb7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34008,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmett Vogan","original_name":"Emmett Vogan","popularity":0.2487,"profile_path":"/gKDRfOG9zZ5lOrNceUSIDI4ZbUh.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Henry Waterman","credit_id":"590f909d9251414e8d024a14","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116845,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Myron Healey","original_name":"Myron Healey","popularity":0.4291,"profile_path":"/fBokJvil9CnupCjfrBylnWmYyjB.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Marshal Travis","credit_id":"590f90a99251414e92025bac","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom London","original_name":"Tom London","popularity":0.2025,"profile_path":"/nfLW8J3AMasTu1Ahm0HftRgx9qy.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Jim Weston","credit_id":"590f90b5c3a3686519022a5c","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120259,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Ford","original_name":"Philip Ford","popularity":0.3113,"profile_path":"/9yjljmmiaFfiFQdK449ZNUPQdrQ.jpg","credit_id":"5669b639c3a36833b6001e41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":32179,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Norman S.
