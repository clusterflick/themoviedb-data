The meeting is essentially a party, and the entire company bumps and grinds with itself everywhere from in boardrooms to airplanes. K-Corea INC. K processes ideas of automation and containment, embodied by these hyper-controlled locations and by the seemingly looping actions that take place in them. Meetings, where discrete parts of a corporate body come together to attempt to \"get on the same page,\" display the futility of corporate unity, and of individual purpose or voice remaining intact within a corporate culture.","popularity":0.1458,"poster_path":"/3Z7iYyCDLESDIe2uHx9xhiFskMh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":202953,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fabric Workshop and Museum","origin_country":""},{"id":202954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goetz Collection","origin_country":""},{"id":202955,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Moore Space","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"K-CoreaINC.
