They then discover a horrifying fact that during the 1930s, fifty black and mullato boys were taken from an orphanage in Rio de Janeiro to the farm where the bricks were found. There they were identified by numbers and were submitted to slave labour by a family that was part of the political and economic elite of the country and who did not hide their Nazi sympathizing ideals.","popularity":0.6052,"poster_path":"/r5t8mWicHZg9yGTzpQVzGCYIe29.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13969,"logo_path":"/bEpiJ2zXGIH70JT16asjWNFtOEv.png","name":"Globo Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boy 23: The Forgotten Boys of Brazil","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":23,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1341409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Belisario Franca","original_name":"Belisario Franca","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/p8aUD5yOvFsGA7LoxNF1Zkswdu9.jpg","credit_id":"5669d19a92514173ff006586","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1341409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Belisario Franca","original_name":"Belisario Franca","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/p8aUD5yOvFsGA7LoxNF1Zkswdu9.jpg","credit_id":"5669d1c1c3a36833b60021c0","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1547293,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lula Cerri","original_name":"Lula Cerri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5669d1d89251417383001ac5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1547294,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Rogério Costa","original_name":"Rogério Costa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5669d1f3c3a36833b60021c5","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1547295,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yan Motta","original_name":"Yan Motta","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5669d202c3a3683699006455","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1547296,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ivanildo Silva","original_name":"Ivanildo Silva","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5669d21c9251415eed001f45","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3121724","wikidata_id":"Q25440993","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/glkCbTypII55PhdJXSW9g59UCxI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":4.387,"height":199,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fbghtl5rfFQSb8sVd6kfZuRGVDb.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":873}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r5t8mWicHZg9yGTzpQVzGCYIe29.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2827,"name":"forced labour"},{"id":2831,"name":"slavery"},{"id":12425,"name":"racism"},{"id":191726,"name":"nazism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"16","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2016-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
