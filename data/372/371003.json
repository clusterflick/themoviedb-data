Who is underneath the mask? This is the story of a group of high school kids - all popular, good looking, \"most likely to succeed\" types - who amuse themselves by pulling pranks on unsuspecting students and teachers. At their core lies a cruelty and shallowness which comes with the territory of privilege. One night, a prank goes horribly wrong, a teenager is killed, and the gang covers it up as a drowning accident but five years later, their lives are turned upside down when a local is killed by a serial killer wearing a haunting Marilyn Monroe mask. Soon, the gang are killed one by one in manners mirroring the pranks they pulled in high school. Is it revenge? Is it karma?","popularity":1.0409,"poster_path":"/oReCaoMWETNfFs4NCPzuO3ikjev.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69224,"logo_path":null,"name":"Juniper
