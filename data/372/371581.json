He was born in the German colony Deutsch-Ostafrika and became a soldier for the Germans during World War I – when he was only nine years old.\r After the Germans lost the war, they failed to hand him his military pay. About a decade later he decides to travel to Germany and personally collect his outstanding money.  This film tells his story – his childhood in the colony and his life and in Nazi Germany – including the holes that the archive leaves open.","popularity":0.0409,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Majub's Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Majubs Reise","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1713628,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bayume Mohamed Husen","original_name":"Bayume Mohamed Husen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"(archive footage)","credit_id":"5e30360b98f1f1000ffe50e4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1545986,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eva Knopf","original_name":"Eva Knopf","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"56658ff492514128170021e9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3743204","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1006,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eFV5vycrrlCe6DZc64Iic2ieRcT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1789},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":999,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bfur0VfONBGIjl9XT6dp3Ug17tp.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1777}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
