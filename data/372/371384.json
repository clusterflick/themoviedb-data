The documentary shares the secrets to some of their most successful records, from the writing and the recording to the tours and the tensions.With contributions from an impressive array of music industry legends including 10cc's band manager Harvey Lisberg, lyricist Sir Tim Rice, broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, legendary producer Trevor Horn, Stewart Copeland (the Police), Graham Nash (the Hollies) and Dan Gillespie Sells (the Feeling), not only does this film highlight the diversity of these four brilliant musicians' songwriting talent, but it also delves into the influence they had, as well as the politics beneath their acrimonious split in 1976, at the height of their fame.","popularity":0.479,"poster_path":"/41pf6PscwfypyIdXtfykPLx927J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70228,"logo_path":"/kXGq4AXfNqSYWPUhrE5DRNd0AJ7.png","name":"Special Treats
