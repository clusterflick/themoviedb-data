Vrindavan is constantly being threatened by the evil King Kamsa, who sees Krishna as his nemesis because of a prophecy which indicates that a savior would end the reign of Kamsa. Oblivious to this prophecy, Krishna continues to pull pranks on everyone without realizing the troubles he averts every time. After the taste of failure, an angry Kamsa refuses to give up trying until he has seen the end of Krishna. Bewildered, he sends out demons after Krishna.
