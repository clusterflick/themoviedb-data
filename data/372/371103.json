Undaunted by the ghost stories surrounding the mountain, a father decides it's just the place for him and his son to go camping and do a little bonding. Strange voices and stranger footprints around their campground try to warn the pair away, but Dad is unconcerned and blithely pushes on. Eventually, however, the two come face to face with the force standing guard over this forbidden mountain.","popularity":0.3574,"poster_path":"/1BI07hU2RYJdqkIlrhFF4GFLYDb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46417,"logo_path":null,"name":"American National Enterprises","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It held the wisdom of the ages... and the terror!","title":"The Force on Thunder Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2058665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Cain","original_name":"Christopher Cain","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Father","credit_id":"5b17a57f0e0a262dcc02444b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2058666,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Todd Dutson","original_name":"Todd Dutson","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Rick","credit_id":"5b17a58ec3a368533d019553","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2058667,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Borge West","original_name":"Borge West","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Prospector","credit_id":"5b17a59e925141783b022791","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2058668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Fogg","original_name":"David Fogg","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Prospector","credit_id":"5b17a5b8c3a368534f0204ba","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2058669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Lyle Strong","original_name":"James Lyle Strong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Aum","credit_id":"5b17a5c8c3a36853330250ca","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1102098,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Peter B.
