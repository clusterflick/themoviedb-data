It is the story of a place suspended in time and space, a place of sounds, smells and numberless thresholds where the memory of a mythical past and the present are inextricably intertwined. It is an investigation into the nature of collective and personal history, into the origin and preservation of memory- how it is etched and perpetrated, both in the minds of the people who still live there, and in that of the soil, the ruins, matter itself. It is the story of the relationship between animate and inanimate matter, and of how this relationship turns into the motor and purpose of existence- a search for the sacred patterns of the quotidian within the rhythms of nature.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ghost Frequency","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1547086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chiara Ambrosio","original_name":"Chiara Ambrosio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"566923f1c3a36836a6005365","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
