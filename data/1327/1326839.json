Grandpa is a foul-mouthed old curmudgeon and Edward is a bible loving neurotic mess. They're stuck spending the day together and they hardly know each other. When grandpa accidentally says the F-word to a passing car, he discovers something peculiar about his grandson. He is tormented by swear words. Edward becomes a shivering, quivering wreck whenever someone swears. Grandpa is bewildered and amused by all this and takes it upon himself to cure what he thinks is a very unfortunate ailment.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edward's Turmoil","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3910673,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kim Albright","original_name":"Kim Albright","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":"/AdqxdNdgMskoxy5UoktBf8i3wDr.jpg","credit_id":"66b432cff9b4864ab7647fd8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1528727","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
