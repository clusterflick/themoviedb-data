Among the resentful villagers is Judson Forrest (Harlan), who wants to be an inventor. Mary Jordan (Bellamy), daughter of the financier, is hurt and spends a night at his home. Learning of his attitude toward her father, she poses as a domestic at the Jordan home. Later, in New York, Judson looks her up. He is trying to sell his invention and, to get funds, he mortgages his home. The village banker, in league with Jordan, sells the financier the mortgage, and a foreclosure threatens when Jordan's business agent Henry Mogridge (Miljan) double-crosses Judson. The youth thinks Mary working against him. Friends come to Judson's aid and he pays off the mortgage in the nick of time. He learns that Jordan knew nothing of the methods employed by his agent and that Mary loves him.","popularity":0.3794,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":171410,"logo_path":null,"name":"Associated Arts Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":42359,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Booking Offices of America (FBO)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1924-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A thrilling story of love, romance and adventure with those three popular favorites.","title":"On the Stroke of Three","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Harlan","original_name":"Kenneth Harlan","popularity":0.1332,"profile_path":"/nIiGHwnOGFrZW2pui9rUKRFPs5p.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Judson Forrest","credit_id":"66b3a9923d1954286df976b4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96470,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madge Bellamy","original_name":"Madge Bellamy","popularity":0.2701,"profile_path":"/wiUNtLSEuorsYdhWAzct1W5nIB3.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mary Jordan","credit_id":"66b3a9a4df0b51e62eb520d6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":141342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Carr","original_name":"Mary Carr","popularity":0.226,"profile_path":"/vV3wvbwq2H0X9PjFMU1q9jXnN0Y.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"'Ma' Forrest","credit_id":"66b3a9dce5ae4b0fa46f76e9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90000,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Miljan","original_name":"John Miljan","popularity":0.4622,"profile_path":"/A19E59RycvNdhUAEqLgMrzsCDmj.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Henry Mogridge","credit_id":"66b3a9f23406e71326886c5f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":217770,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Dudley","original_name":"Robert Dudley","popularity":0.1563,"profile_path":"/qe9QRGhhfRXjavUSIAQfh9r1Cu6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Jasper Saddler","credit_id":"66b3aa0a14bbf75ee3b521cc","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4872577,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leonore Matre","original_name":"Leonore Matre","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Lillian Haskins","credit_id":"66b3aa42348480ed4792e0b4","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwards Davis","original_name":"Edwards Davis","popularity":0.1152,"profile_path":"/tZwEJcv0w7ruzWPYkw4XGJcdthX.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Lafayette Jordan","credit_id":"66b3aad343aa765974452977","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Phillips","original_name":"Eddie Phillips","popularity":0.1428,"profile_path":"/xaV8DRnqhiQ1qHm9W2XfDRfwDzZ.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Austin Dudley","credit_id":"66b3aaf5557c46a6c76f7442","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4872593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothy Dahmas","original_name":"Dorothy Dahmas","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Emily Jordan","credit_id":"66b3ab28809a001ccaa87b86","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30258,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Victor Milner","original_name":"Victor Milner","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b3ab89615315bff76f0a42","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1638415,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"O.E.
