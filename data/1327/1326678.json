After amassing an impressive collection of genre-spanning EPs scouring depths of emotion, pain, anger, relief, and hope, burgeoning Nashville-based indie alternative rocker Seth Findley (AKA moony) is at full form, ready to deliver his debut LP to the world. WARNING HIGH CUBE is a bold full-throttle whirlwind of a hero’s journey, serving as moony’s definitive allegory of his life so far, exploring swirling ideas of existentialism, nature, animals, spirituality, love, friendship, and the threads that hold humanity together. moony & Joey set out to create a unique audio/visual pairing for the album, unlike anything they’d seen or felt. The result is 50 uncanny, undefinable, and sometimes uncomfortable minutes. A new world ripe for the picking, WARNING HIGH CUBE and its accompanying film are here to save mankind.","popularity":0.2749,"poster_path":"/gSs9XK7MJ6lbzr7EacuwbE1bFur.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
