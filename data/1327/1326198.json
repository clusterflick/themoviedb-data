He then translates for her a conversation she has with a half-blind old man. She recounts her memories of a past party at which Amadigné worked with her as an informant. Later, in front of the cliff, Germaine, Djamgouno and Pangalé are sitting on rocks, and Germaine talks about the many caves that can be visited by climbing small spelunking ladders. Rouch intervenes during the interview, asking the protagonists about the settlement of the cliff by the Dogon, who learned from the Tellem how to climb the cliff. Rouch then asks about the Tellem's predecessors who lived there 2,400 years ago. Germaine admits the ignorance of researchers on the subject, and Rouch concludes by joking about the new task that now falls to Germaine Dieterlen.","popularity":0.2538,"poster_path":"/t3QRNIlSGKElg5sNm7kEkqEdhCh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41695,"logo_path":null,"name":"Comité du film Éthnographique","origin_country":""},{"id":13542,"logo_path":"/sJ0R9LDMGR5ildYS4GMhQcbKJVD.png","name":"CNRS Images","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Germaine et ses copains","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1663968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germaine Dieterlen","original_name":"Germaine Dieterlen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/kp4e1RLTsaIuOosd8QiseYeT7lu.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"herself","credit_id":"66b28f59092e7cc59ffc61de","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":238960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean Rouch","original_name":"Jean Rouch","popularity":0.2114,"profile_path":"/808sK0h9rZ5ljP2bOxyyvLmbDn7.jpg","credit_id":"66b28f89a2838813fb6f562a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2c8uWtQO3zMby8Yd0P4YKcuidgO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Jt9c1TBdnoFN8iNOzawZC3TjaB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/keDiYdfNPjs2iKYI90Cie4e9HXn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wt7PqLGBDNc3FqUIPySQ5uxWf5Y.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yJ7pVan9WkCSysZ57K0PP8clGYO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jr0i9S1YPy4zfVA526fgm2sRAJ4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/81avUCgXuHwRzEvkkgabrloh4NB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2153,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t3QRNIlSGKElg5sNm7kEkqEdhCh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1435}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208669,"name":"mali"},{"id":227593,"name":"ethnographic film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
