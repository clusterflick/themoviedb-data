Part caper, part road trip, part spiritual journey, the film follows Cree filmmaker Neil Diamond (Reel Injun) as he travels coast-to-coast and across the Atlantic and back, gradually piecing together this global story of influence, reconnection and restitution.","popularity":0.0776,"poster_path":"/kSqFcJgowePmZt8suJPkTU2iqcA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2024-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"So Surreal: Behind the Masks","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1379811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neil Diamond","original_name":"Neil Diamond","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/4o0DasKokALa7l6HsqmdZqoJ8xp.jpg","credit_id":"66b45d4af227d97c489c818b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1797830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joanne Robertson","original_name":"Joanne Robertson","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b45d53167ff6beaf9c81e4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h7fDUPtn34mqW0upwht8SKx8VAI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1281}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kSqFcJgowePmZt8suJPkTU2iqcA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-09-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Vancouver International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
