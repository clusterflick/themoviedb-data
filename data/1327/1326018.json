This failed political assassination was destined to become a strange historical footnote, yet Moore is revealed as an extraordinary subject in this expansive, fascinating new documentary by the protean Robinson Devor (The Woman Chaser, NYFF37). Having served more than 30 years of a life prison sentence, Moore tells her own story, from FBI informant to would-be assassin, all of which Devor dramatizes against the backdrop of the era’s prevalent political unrest and militancy, of Attica, the Black Panthers, the U.S.-backed Chilean coup, and the Symbionese Liberation Army. A pugnacious and unapologetic interview subject, Moore holds the center of a fleet and compelling nonfiction drama with the feel of a 1970s thriller.","popularity":0.8722,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Suburban Fury","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4908303,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Jane Moore","original_name":"Sara Jane Moore","popularity":0.0218,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66ceaaff4d670e0d5ec61469","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":101515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robinson Devor","original_name":"Robinson Devor","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b2296bf2e102c3193a5141","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":101515,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robinson Devor","original_name":"Robinson Devor","popularity":0.0629,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ceaa373944d3d3fa9639d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766091,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Robert Finkle","original_name":"Robert Finkle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ceaa41b9d822e06f084620","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":369420,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Charles Mudede","original_name":"Charles Mudede","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ceaa4d6ea4941437a0a074","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4908301,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zachariah Sebastian","original_name":"Zachariah Sebastian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ceaa71bd9806d8f04adba4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2520789,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Reid","original_name":"Jason Reid","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ceaa7c0b8489b3e4a0a1f8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1830064,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sean Kirby","original_name":"Sean Kirby","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":"/jVd0sy8MswyTUu56gzxLvh8VgIG.jpg","credit_id":"66ceaa966c0b67cbc1bb1b8c","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242530,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bob Finkel","original_name":"Bob Finkel","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ceaaa748592e84e3c6172a","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2790306,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"D.D.
