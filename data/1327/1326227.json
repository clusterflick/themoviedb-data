They have been asked to speak about a painting that is never shown or identified in the video: Picasso’s Weeping Woman (1937, Tate Modern). They begin by slowly describing the painting, yet their remarks quickly escalate as their imaginations are sparked: “Maybe her stepmum was like…evil; maybe nobody liked her”; “Maybe that’s a million-pound bill and she can’t pay it.”","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1I7jwvLCX0rmMTEQEdZHwVwDLLj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I See a Woman Crying (Weeping Woman)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4840745,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rineke Dijkstra","original_name":"Rineke Dijkstra","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"673c65943555417913b1454f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1I7jwvLCX0rmMTEQEdZHwVwDLLj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
