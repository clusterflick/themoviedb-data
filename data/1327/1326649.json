Launched by Rashid Masharawi, a notable Palestinian filmmaker, the initiative emerged amid the backdrop of conflict, aiming to provide a platform for young artists to express themselves through their craft.  Each film, ranging from 3 to 7 minutes, presents a unique perspective on the current reality in Gaza. The project captures the diverse experiences of life in the Palestinian enclave, including the challenges, tragedies, and moments of resilience faced by its people. With a mix of genres such as fiction, documentary, docu-fiction, animation, and experimental cinema, \"From Ground Zero\" showcases a rich tapestry of stories that reflect the sorrow, joy, and hope inherent in Gazan life.","popularity":0.6523,"poster_path":"/fa1awdcPtuKEIpQNM4AKu9vCPQh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":237170,"logo_path":"/z9UBadNoLZhmkB2P7rthfA3pZMq.png","name":"Masharawi Fund
