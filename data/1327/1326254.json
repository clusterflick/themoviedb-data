After the death of his child, he can no longer draw, because the last picture is a line that symbolizes the end. The other drawings make him reminisce about how he met his wife Mia and how they raised their child, Alex. In the present, however, he is alone, his child is dead and the marriage has failed. Their grief was too different, which is why they no longer understood each other. At the worst low point on the anniversary of the death, Teo receives metaphorical clues through a series of uncovered images that lead him on a path of self-discovery. The climax of the movie shows the unexpected encounter between Teo and Mia in the park, a symbolic place of their shared past. Teo realizes that Mia has always grieved in her own way and came to the park on their anniversary to swing where they used to celebrate Alex's birthdays together.â€”Edgar Huebert","popularity":0.0754,"poster_path":"/8tn9uZRRlYNTwn7iuz2bPnEBrdj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Sketch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marvin Moers","original_name":"Marvin Moers","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Teo","credit_id":"66b2bdcde515cc68888c1fe7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3141691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Samuel Prost","original_name":"Samuel Prost","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Friend","credit_id":"66b2bde107f635830c1d376e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3625560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alina Rausch","original_name":"Alina Rausch","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Mia","credit_id":"66b2bdf7bf96fbff9a8c1b42","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871086,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sanja Reicherts","original_name":"Sanja Reicherts","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Alex","credit_id":"66b2be058c39ae137cb50a8b","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871089,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fabian Glaser","original_name":"Fabian Glaser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b2be823e9c00c573f13304","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgar Huebert","original_name":"Edgar Huebert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b2be139cf97b292292cbec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgar Huebert","original_name":"Edgar Huebert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b2be587d4257da0245147b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4871087,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Edgar Huebert","original_name":"Edgar Huebert","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66b2be4eb2c9ca16d74bea20","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8tn9uZRRlYNTwn7iuz2bPnEBrdj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
