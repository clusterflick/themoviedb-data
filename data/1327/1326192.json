Its walls are covered with paintings depicting the different phases of creation. A little further on, in a cave near the village of Bongo, symposium participants are discussing the Tellem, the people who lived in the houses built into the cliffs before the arrival of the Dogon. The archaeological remains and migratory movements of these two peoples are discussed.","popularity":0.2049,"poster_path":"/bHJXrycEZ2ByfwAfkfmsPVnFnkf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13542,"logo_path":"/sJ0R9LDMGR5ildYS4GMhQcbKJVD.png","name":"CNRS Images","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":41695,"logo_path":null,"name":"Comité du film Éthnographique","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ML","name":"Mali"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hommage à Marcel Mauss.
