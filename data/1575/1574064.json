The film blends documentary and narrative elements to depict the filmmaker’s mother’s rigid vision for her daughter’s life, set against the reality unfolding through archival footage dating back to 1995. Through directing an actor to play her mother and fill in the widening gaps over time, O’Connor now attempts to sculpt her mother.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fault Line","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2558462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brydie O'Connor","original_name":"Brydie O'Connor","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6908ec68c8fbe205e94646cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38681589","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
