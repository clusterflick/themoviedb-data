Born in landlocked Nuremberg, Steudtner abandoned school at sixteen to chase the ocean — a decision that led him from windsurfing in Hawaii to confronting towering walls of water few humans would dare approach. Shunned at first by the insular surf world, mocked onstage after career-defining rides, and often left without sponsors, he refused to quit. His relentless pursuit carried him from the icy shores of Ireland to the legendary swells of Nazaré, Portugal — the wave that would not only catapult him into the history books but also shift the center of big wave surfing to Europe.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On The Wave","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2506298,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Wolf","original_name":"Peter Wolf","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690951446b4edd01d91e5a51","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4834595,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Axel Gerdau","original_name":"Axel Gerdau","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6909514a175798ec82c96456","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
