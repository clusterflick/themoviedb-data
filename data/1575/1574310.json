Their life cycle, in which they slash and burn one area of the mountainside, move on after a year or two, and eventually return to the same location, was similar to the rotational movement of the wooden spinning tops the tribe's young men skillfully wield in a traditional game.  Sam-ok applied for the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie screenwriting grant and was the last qualifying screenplay.  He won a grant of 40,000 francs ($16,000) U.S., which enabled him to produce Lenetene's Spinning Tops on a Sony U-matic High-Band.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":279337,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lao Inter Art","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LA","name":"Lao People's Democratic Republic"}],"release_date":"1994-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lao","iso_639_1":"lo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lenetene's Spinning Tops","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1441520,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Som-Ok Southiphone","original_name":"Som-Ok Southiphone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6909567aa1cf33c3e311267b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1934317","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"lo","note":"","release_date":"1994-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
