Roza has been almost completely alone since she was very young, but has not given up her struggle for happiness. She writes poetry, paints pictures holding a brush in her mouth, uses a computer and studies foreign languages. And an important part of her life is her faith. It prevents her from sinking into despair, something which pulls strongly at her in the isolated world of the hospital.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":279416,"logo_path":null,"name":"Birarija Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2000-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roza","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5796841,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roza Mojsovska","original_name":"Roza Mojsovska","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"690a746a1bf75db625b6903e","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3091424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maja Mladenovska","original_name":"Maja Mladenovska","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690a73b6a8b9039e909348d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5796838,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Blaže Minevski","original_name":"Blaže Minevski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690a73c8e67198cad39348ed","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1531905,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dejan Dimeski","original_name":"Dejan Dimeski","popularity":0.0431,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690a73dd3e3df38edc789fcc","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1538194,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Blaže Dulev","original_name":"Blaže Dulev","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690a73e9f9d3941a20f6cbc1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3091424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maja Mladenovska","original_name":"Maja Mladenovska","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690a73fd1e28d988bc9348f5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1543269,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mile Arsovski","original_name":"Mile Arsovski","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690a7425ea40a1d550789ff3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Manaki Brothers Film Festival","release_date":"2000-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
