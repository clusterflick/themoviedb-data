Emily Dale, Morgan's confidential adviser, prefers Steele and urges him to win, while Higgins calls to his aid a renegade mechanic. Steele places his car on a train, and Higgins plans to wreck it so as to be the first to claim the prize; his plan succeeds, but Morgan is taken ill, giving Steele and Emily time to recondition the car. Emily obtains right-of-way over main roads and permission to speed on a record-breaking trip to California. In spite of attempts to stall her, Emily wins the race, though forced to drive her car through a show window. Steele is rewarded by Morgan with the money and the love of Emily.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/vVhnBJXpcK2pobFFNLJpeHFCnLv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40375,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metropolitan Pictures Corporation of California","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Speeding Venus","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Vênus no Volante","type":"Brazilian title"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Venus ved Rattet","type":"Danish title"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Vénus sportive","type":"French title"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"A száguldó Vénusz","type":"Hungarian title"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"A Vénus Desportista","type":"Portuguese title"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"La Venus de la velocidad","type":"Spanish title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Behind the Wheel","type":"Working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Priscilla Dean","original_name":"Priscilla Dean","popularity":0.2683,"profile_path":"/twj8OOwEL8vlkD7h5sF7pFL8gk2.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Emily Dale","credit_id":"69094265e4c162b3acc9678d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Frazer","original_name":"Robert Frazer","popularity":0.312,"profile_path":"/t6vR9YlN5O7D1NXQvOIOV0fDMEy.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"John Steele","credit_id":"6909428c99183fba09f5fb79","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35504,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dale Fuller","original_name":"Dale Fuller","popularity":0.5835,"profile_path":"/bP9GxGcEopIOrC6kWblHeF1GVbK.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Midge Rooney","credit_id":"690942a47b92750246c96919","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":139241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Fox","original_name":"Johnny Fox","popularity":0.4389,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Speck O'Donnell","credit_id":"690942c440d6cec36470c74c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1562382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Ripley","original_name":"Ray Ripley","popularity":0.1958,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Chet Higgins","credit_id":"690942ddd323300686413557","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Sellon","original_name":"Charles Sellon","popularity":0.3899,"profile_path":"/afTnl6HF8CV5SPjVniFDUMG8MtR.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jed Morgan","credit_id":"690942fe808ad7941e82a9f8","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Thornby","original_name":"Robert Thornby","popularity":0.2209,"profile_path":"/dNxou1Tn7Yhm1Rk1oxx8JGC5iBi.jpg","credit_id":"690943146d802f650ec963d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5794743,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Welford Beaton","original_name":"Welford Beaton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69094334343eacc149db8ad4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1391910,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Finis Fox","original_name":"Finis Fox","popularity":0.4308,"profile_path":"/wFMZnF0alj7Cv8pwmbKcDWfFV9R.jpg","credit_id":"690943406ad5f44e14c96817","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2115592,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Georges Benoît","original_name":"Georges Benoît","popularity":0.1073,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69094350947517b14e82aa54","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0017424","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1326,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vVhnBJXpcK2pobFFNLJpeHFCnLv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":884}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"1926-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
