Nevertheless, the Harvard 5 found New Canaan’s wooded, rolling hills to be the perfect canvas for experimentation with Bauhaus ideals in design and architecture. From there, they triggered an intellectual movement that not only changed the landscape of this New England community forever, but would resonate worldwide.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Harvard Five","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1300182,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Devon Chivvis","original_name":"Devon Chivvis","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6909506ca5e8412f5f82ab24","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
