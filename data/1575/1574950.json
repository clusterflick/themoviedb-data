His wife, Laura, piqued by his apparent indifference, is left in the hands of Carl Tanzer, supposedly the doctor's best friend, whose advances she rejects. Laura contrives to make her husband jealous with a bogus letter, but to no avail; later, escaping from a masher, she meets her husband's friend Fritz Schwerman, from whom she escapes after accepting a luncheon offer. While Laura tries to vamp her husband's other friends at a card game, the countess tries to make love to the doctor. Rittenhaus returns home in disgust and is happily reconciled with his wife.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/9sFDDI72AmRLwRIyWyh0NQ8D4jB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40375,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metropolitan Pictures Corporation of California","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Wives Only","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","title":"Hvad ved du om Kærlighed?","type":"Danish title"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les amis de nos maris","type":"French title"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"A kecskék és a káposzta","type":"Hungarian title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98971,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie Prevost","original_name":"Marie Prevost","popularity":0.4587,"profile_path":"/ziCYgNywxyUCKyxRw7vqBWrFMgd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Laura Rittenhaus","credit_id":"690a86340ae91bba28d72e89","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":117735,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Varconi","original_name":"Victor Varconi","popularity":0.909,"profile_path":"/aX8xp2GEriKwjOf3t4MrTOHC00G.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Dr. Rittenhaus","credit_id":"690a86594fa3be9821d72e81","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles K.
