Featuring stunning insights from premiere scientific institutions, academics, and theologians, we’ll look both at how science explains miracles, as well as what the Bible says about the miraculous in modern times.  Through the investigative lens of science and the first-hand testimony of people who have experienced the supernatural, we will help shed light on phenomena seemingly beyond explanation and get answers to some of the burning questions about faith, healing, and the supernatural.  Whether you have experienced a miracle in your own life or are still skeptical, Investigating the Supernatural: Miracles is a powerful, investigative look into the supernatural at work.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mNnMXuyqA67OWEZ8AcnTCvhCAwd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":279388,"logo_path":null,"name":"CBN News","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Journey of Discovery Into the Evidence of Modern-Day Miracles","title":"Investigating the Supernatural: Miracles","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5796096,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Hallowell","original_name":"Billy Hallowell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"690a1af93c47569350db8fbe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1085483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Strobel","original_name":"Lee Strobel","popularity":0.4452,"profile_path":"/lSnWoGvqpdC9fP4odKsOizFksD4.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"690a1b39cb9cc8db12f5ff27","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2972425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Keener","original_name":"Craig Keener","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/noutlqH8fDXUu6Bf86KrDHVuEgk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"690a1bd60f5bebb538c9682e","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2623040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jarrod Anderson","original_name":"Jarrod Anderson","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690a1c230f887021ca4139e3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2623040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jarrod Anderson","original_name":"Jarrod Anderson","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690a1c38bf5a30d9f6c9697a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29089628","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.677,"height":2956,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mNnMXuyqA67OWEZ8AcnTCvhCAwd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
