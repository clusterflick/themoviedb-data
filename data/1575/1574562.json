She crafts a crown and ties her wish to it with a ribbon, hoping it will be accepted in the celebration. When she joins the other girls, they mock her, but eventually, her crown is accepted, offering her a glimmer of hope. Suddenly, however, the crown falls and breaks beyond repair. Agáta tries to fix it but, realizing it’s hopeless, rushes to the ceremony with only the ribbon, desperate to fulfill her wish. She arrives too late, and alone with her unspoken longing, she instead finds solace in the quiet beauty of nature around her.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/j1uItTRYNQPLIvBH7EiYJIvYGw8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2025-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Agáta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5795784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Benedetta Fiore","original_name":"Benedetta Fiore","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6909ecf9efd00b56eac96a60","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/j1uItTRYNQPLIvBH7EiYJIvYGw8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Drama International Short Film Festival","release_date":"2025-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
