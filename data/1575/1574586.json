A film about the end of adolescence in the 1990s, set between Athens and Brussels. Fragments and snippets of memory, stitched together in the way memory actually works: through the flow of emotions. Letters inspired by those my friends sent me in Brussels, Super 8 footage I shot myself, photographs, Video 8 material, and newly filmed standalone scenes. The final medium is 16mm film.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nineteen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1157094,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Angelos Frantzis","original_name":"Άγγελος Φραντζής","popularity":0.4236,"profile_path":"/xv09wV8CPqx0C8iYEfDrjNEDlJ.jpg","credit_id":"6909fb71a1cf33c3e3112961","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
