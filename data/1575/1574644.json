It’s a leaked ritual.  Somewhere between analog prayer and digital disease, a collection of gestures tried to become human again. They failed.  Children orbit the fence like insects around an electric hymn. A figure holds a violin but never plays — his silence is louder than the sound. The man in the branches hasn’t fallen in years. The killer appears, or doesn’t — but you’ll feel him beneath the cuts, mouthing things you’ll wish you didn’t understand.  There are bodies, sometimes clothed in flesh, sometimes not.  There is scripture, mangled and reversed — not to mock it, but to unlock it. The voice speaks, but only when you stop listening.  This is the place where lost footage remembers you. Where noise prays back.  CHOKE ECHO was compiled under duress by 0xHamza in 2025 using material never meant to be rearranged. Watch it if you must — but it will keep watching after you close the tab.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6LLUPD1f4Je8b0EyVimRjIrz35G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"2025-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Do not adjust your memory.","title":"CHOKE ECHO","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5536906,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Unkown","original_name":"Unkown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"690a8082d40ce6406b78a01d","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":5171841,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"0xHaitham","original_name":"0xHaitham","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/4AhbDCYOFNUdsf8C4UmyqyNJlv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"690a808c6caad11a094bcd6f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":204432,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Houda Echouafni","original_name":"Houda Echouafni","popularity":0.8797,"profile_path":"/tIvpNxXiPewiRYc5LnH67xFE2Dz.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"no name in the movie","credit_id":"690a82f6e3b14b8372d72e74","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3834815,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"gabriel","original_name":"gabriel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"voice over","credit_id":"690a8321ea63cbaab478a028","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":1893659,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laura Weeda","original_name":"Laura Weeda","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"690a83333b2edc484e070ca4","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5796968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"The Orbiters","original_name":"The Orbiters","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"children","credit_id":"690a89c1024c4f07704bce57","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5796969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Himself","original_name":"Himself","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"The Figure in the Branches","credit_id":"690a89e7a5aa36b59fd72eba","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":5171842,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"0xHamza","original_name":"0xHamza","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/27Res7zmQJpDIUsfLVIcvN6rDmH.jpg","credit_id":"690a80a8024c4f07704bcdcd","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5796936,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"0xhmza","original_name":"0xhmza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690a81648b604bf4904bcd1b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5796943,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"0xhmza","original_name":"0xhmza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690a8239aec3966cafe182b7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2100,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8iGH8vRr1iXpfGA1OaAOvQtUVug.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3734}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1137,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6LLUPD1f4Je8b0EyVimRjIrz35G.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":758}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3036,"name":"bible"},{"id":10937,"name":"memory"},{"id":11616,"name":"vhs"},{"id":163053,"name":"found footage"},{"id":166514,"name":"underground film"},{"id":208733,"name":"video art"},{"id":210324,"name":"decay"},{"id":250871,"name":"video artist"},{"id":293336,"name":"experimental film"},{"id":299518,"name":"vhs release"},{"id":309181,"name":"satanic bible"},{"id":346773,"name":"dream"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
