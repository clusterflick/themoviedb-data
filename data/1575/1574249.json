A series of reenactments brings Anton Bruckner's training years to life. Under the direction of Gunar Letzbor, precise reconstructions of works from Bruckner's sound world of the 1830s are performed. In contrast, the rehearsals and performances of the current St. Florian Boys' Choir, under the artistic direction of Prof. Franz Farnberger and choirmaster Markus Stumpner, MA, present the choir's sound today.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die St. Florianer Sängerknaben - Bruckners musikalische Heimat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
