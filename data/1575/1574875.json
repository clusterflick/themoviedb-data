Scenes shift between the mundane and the profound, forming a nonlinear tapestry of female experience—desire, limitation, resilience. A voice, both singular and collective, narrates in diary-like reflections, speaking of love, shame, pleasure, and the unspoken rules that shape their bodies and choices. Shot in a cinéma vérité style, the film’s grainy, handheld aesthetic mirrors the imperfection and authenticity of memory, blurring the line between personal and universal. Fleeting moments flicker and dissolve, immersing the viewer in a rhythmic flow of images and emotions. As time loops and fragments, The Land of Wanting More becomes both an intimate confession and a quiet rebellion—an ode to the complexities of womanhood, caught between wanting, waiting, and becoming.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/3fX0bha7O6F99WNAFiZxnHMhNPP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Land of Wanting More","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3247533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianna Rantou","original_name":"Marianna Rantou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"690a672011ce729866070bea","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3247533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianna Rantou","original_name":"Marianna Rantou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690a6747ef67b8a8a04bccf6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3247533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianna Rantou","original_name":"Marianna Rantou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690a67524dc759cbf0f6cbc0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3247533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianna Rantou","original_name":"Marianna Rantou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690a675d2adf1658cbe18269","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5796722,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexandros Zilos","original_name":"Alexandros Zilos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690a6770b19e148b8bd72e04","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.656,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3fX0bha7O6F99WNAFiZxnHMhNPP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":525}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
