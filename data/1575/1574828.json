He delivers some one-liners, a few homilies on politics, a recollection of early non-sex, a bit about writing exam papers in utter ignorance of the topic and ends up with John Candy in a skit about a psychiatrist. Also included is a hilarious take-off on the award- winning film \"My Dinner With Andre,\" entitled \"My Dinner With Duddy.\" Mr. Steinberg and Mr. Candy, big-time comedians, meet in a delicatessen and exchange heartfelt inanities about creativity, soberly paralleling the real thing.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/AdmCk4Qn9wlTFMN5uc6dI7xSgy6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46976,"logo_path":"/A8LyPh201AmDlyBley6r9R3SZYS.png","name":"RKO Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1984-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"David Steinberg in Concert With John Candy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Steinberg","original_name":"David Steinberg","popularity":0.4304,"profile_path":"/zQ6hCCSmrzBTNYuaSE3TULljJyq.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"690a57c88e134788ee74b67c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7180,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Candy","original_name":"John Candy","popularity":2.5809,"profile_path":"/uvLWbMDE6UfWNF5tfrsrC9NqeEA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"690a57d2d1da37e589ba3ff3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Steinberg","original_name":"David Steinberg","popularity":0.4304,"profile_path":"/zQ6hCCSmrzBTNYuaSE3TULljJyq.jpg","credit_id":"690a57ebee8fbbfa571a08cb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AdmCk4Qn9wlTFMN5uc6dI7xSgy6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9716,"name":"stand-up comedy"},{"id":276162,"name":"stand-up comedian"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1984-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
