Just days after her college graduation, a snorkeling trip turned into a nightmare when the accomplished collegiate swimmer was attacked by a shark. The brutal encounter would test every ounce of her strength and will to live. Against staggering odds, Ali survived — but her life was forever altered. The loss of her leg marked not just a physical transformation, but an emotional reckoning. Faced with unimaginable trauma, Ali made a powerful choice: to reclaim her story and use her experience to inspire others. Leaning on the values that had always guided her, she set her sights on a nearly unthinkable goal — earning a spot on the 2024 U.S. Paralympic Team... just one year after the attack. This film follows her extraordinary journey: through the pain of recovery, the battle to return to the water, the triumph of making Team USA, and ultimately, rising to the podium in Paris.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stronger Than You Think","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5794857,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Janice  c.
