For nearly a century, this architectural icon has become a harbinger of despair, claiming thousands of lives and leaving lasting scars on the Coast Guard crews and Bridge Patrol officers who respond to each tragedy. Through the tireless work of advocates and survivors, a movement arose to reclaim the bridge’s legacy and prove that compassionate intervention and restricted access can save lives. Poignant and unflinching, Death Bridge is both a memorial and a call to action.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"A documentary film that will save lives.","title":"Death Bridge","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1635720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Logan Paul","original_name":"Logan Paul","popularity":0.9707,"profile_path":"/7hw17l1vmQu2MmLGDX8PBLpm2Sk.jpg","credit_id":"69096dc7dde4bc0777db8bc5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":939248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Hines","original_name":"Kevin Hines","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69096dde011458024b1e5ae9","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4170621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zak Williams","original_name":"Zak Williams","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":"/dXZK68ogwrsmWuzoto5EvaUG5vr.jpg","credit_id":"69096e1fb4f4029f87c964b0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":84214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Taylor Lautner","original_name":"Taylor Lautner","popularity":1.9042,"profile_path":"/mxersUkPKcpcHDtyJUmP8G5HDBk.jpg","credit_id":"69096e3f16519f21d670c952","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"deathbridgefilm","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Death Bridge (Official Trailer)","key":"LE5EK04_5eU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-10-10T17:58:09.000Z","id":"69096d5bf168ad93be413638"}]}}}
