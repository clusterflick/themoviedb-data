MATCH #1 Steve Sterling battles the spectacular 1995 Colt desk calendar cover model Harley Grant. MATCH #2 delivers French freestyle wrestling champ Pascal Lafayette to Sterling's flashy pro-wrestling demolition-style of submission suffering. MATCH #3 is a rodeo-style squash job in which young, blond Finland born Rik Kamen gets his passport stamped and stomped Steve Sterling style. MATCH #4 Sterling makes short sport out of a nasty-hot Italian studboy named Tico finishing him off brutally in two straight falls... MATCH #5 is Sterling's toughest match to date with a massively muscled Latino terminator named Ramon Villalobos.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steve Sterling's International Submisions","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":3366252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Sterling","original_name":"Steve Sterling","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/yJNSTyTxDL4deZR7arQ5p4hfATX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"69097b8ff9bc68776ac96954","order":0},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5795154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harley Grant","original_name":"Harley Grant","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"69097bbd13298ac3addb8c82","order":1},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5795156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pascal Lafayette","original_name":"Pascal Lafayette","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"69097bc58e058f95b782ab04","order":2},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5795157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rik Kamen","original_name":"Rik Kamen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"69097bcecb9e08c9f6db8c3d","order":3},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5795158,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tico","original_name":"Tico","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"69097be6584577f603f5fd59","order":4},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":5795160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramon Villabos","original_name":"Ramon Villabos","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"69097befd0d45c262882ac51","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":3050748,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Sexton","original_name":"Ron Sexton","popularity":1.03,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69097c0d99ecfcbba3c968d9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":2,"id":3050748,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ron Sexton","original_name":"Ron Sexton","popularity":1.03,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69097c1900019f42d4c968d8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/25Yc5q8CwXDnHQBntoGKx5nHlEJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
