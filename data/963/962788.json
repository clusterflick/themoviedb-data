The film-within-a-film concerns Henry, a young man who invites his girlfriend Charlotte to his family cottage for the winter holidays. As a surprise for Charlotte, Henry also invites his eccentric mother Sally and Charlotte's overbearing father Gordon. The surprise, however, is the truth about Sally and Gordon. Hilarity, the occasional tender moment, and the promises and pitfalls of filmmaking ensue as all try to keep their various secrets from being spilled.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/AjkU1X0ACyx6hPnJpxCaV50n2gf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173441,"logo_path":null,"name":"Next Phase Motion Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beautiful Accidents","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"A Lot Like Marriage","type":"working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1791801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trish Rainone","original_name":"Trish Rainone","popularity":0.1136,"profile_path":"/wYFxp6HRstOjlYNM1o1VZCWbLsW.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Charlotte","credit_id":"6258947a392712009de4534e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3506918,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary-Alice Farina","original_name":"Mary-Alice Farina","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Sally","credit_id":"6258949009191b005080f40a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3506919,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Greg Carere","original_name":"Greg Carere","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Henry","credit_id":"625894b343cd5401618227cf","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3506920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave DeBorde","original_name":"Dave DeBorde","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Gordon","credit_id":"625894c469eb90005046e57e","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1282016,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"B.P.
