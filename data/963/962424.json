Despite recent wet winters, California’s water supply will continue to be threatened by ongoing population growth and longer, more frequent droughts caused by climate change.\r Southern California, an arid region especially vulnerable due to its reliance on imported water, has been a pioneer in the use of innovative water technologies. But as a shadow of drought hangs over the state, much more needs to be done to avert the region’s looming water crisis.","popularity":0.0852,"poster_path":"/kyJEXTJ0AtruP67no6qZAYNMjSB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadow of Drought: Southern California's Looming Water Crisis","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2515006,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Wisneski","original_name":"Bill Wisneski","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668ea61bc1981769fb699c8a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2515009,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chad Richmond","original_name":"Chad Richmond","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668ea62db91aebabd62eba25","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2515006,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Wisneski","original_name":"Bill Wisneski","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668ea64a02a18d01a7bc847e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7182786","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kyJEXTJ0AtruP67no6qZAYNMjSB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
