World-renowned detective Sherlock Holmes and his colleague Dr Watson are asked to unravel the mystery surrounding the untimely death of Sir Charles Baskerville. With rumours of a cursed giant hound loose on the loose moors, they must act fast in order to save the Baskerville family's last remaining heir. A hit in the West End, this ingenious adaptation combines an exhilarating collision of farce, theatrical invention and wonderfully comic performances to offer a brand-new twist on the greatest detective story of all time. A whodunnit for all ages.","popularity":0.2681,"poster_path":"/fbcxU4rZBYEIA1hXawWPytfoEM9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Original Theatre Company","origin_country":""},{"id":173422,"logo_path":null,"name":"Octagon Theatre Bolton","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hound of the Baskervilles","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1626594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jake Ferretti","original_name":"Jake Ferretti","popularity":0.0698,"profile_path":"/94GzCm2vWq3s1FoJIB8bSWWFduI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Sherlock Holmes","credit_id":"625862d3dd258900667dd179","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3506590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Serena Manteghi","original_name":"Serena Manteghi","popularity":0.148,"profile_path":"/4dFAPdYZNntITkTO1np7rbXJrNA.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Sir Henry Baskerville","credit_id":"625862ddd236e6005089cab6","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1730568,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niall Ransome","original_name":"Niall Ransome","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":"/hoZVu8xljHiTuSVIRjEdOBB9qoT.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dr Watson","credit_id":"625862e739271200501575ca","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3506593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lotte Wakeham","original_name":"Lotte Wakeham","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625862f9f548360067ec0475","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3506595,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Jackson","original_name":"Tim Jackson","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6258630643cd54016091808c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3506597,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steven Canny","original_name":"Steven Canny","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62586316b6abc40065f477a9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3506598,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Nicholson","original_name":"John Nicholson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62586322e0ec51009b25a283","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25167,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Arthur Conan Doyle","original_name":"Arthur Conan Doyle","popularity":0.6736,"profile_path":"/eF5Kbsi6Agf8yWeq5rHJN4FM6WY.jpg","credit_id":"6258632cb6abc4009d4448fa","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19704584","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/fibLHWCM237GHX2QTwz7ByRBDzj.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2560},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":867,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yu9BzUYGhxA47FQyWrnW0cgS7pP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1542}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1012,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/fbcxU4rZBYEIA1hXawWPytfoEM9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":675},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5MIti1xBEvNFDuj7w8t6NyA5dWv.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":888,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/897UBqhOkLNQejZa046pxN9jiRk.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":593}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4326,"name":"theater play"},{"id":273879,"name":"sherlock holmes"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"streaming premiere","release_date":"2022-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Hound of the Baskervilles - The Cast In Rehearsals","key":"pzjquaKpx3s","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Behind the Scenes","official":false,"published_at":"2021-09-06T17:01:01.000Z","id":"625863b503bf840050728e5f"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Hound of Baskervilles - Tour Trailer","key":"JN3fWK9WFlE","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-09-06T16:55:27.000Z","id":"625863c774d6c0016b6ebbb6"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Hound of the Baskervilles - Meet the Cast","key":"xCM2OIM8cV4","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2021-09-03T11:51:32.000Z","id":"6258639613a3200053f53c5d"}]}}}
