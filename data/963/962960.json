'The book has become a phenomenon', the publisher said at the presentation of the 400,000th copy. Director Pieter Verhoeff follows Jan Siebelink on his jaunts along jam-packed libraries and churches, where readers hang on his lips. The eloquent Siebelink has a kind word for everybody: 'I feel they have the right to get acquainted with the author.' At home, ensconced in the intimacy of his living room, Siebelink explains his personal motives for writing the novel. His statements are illustrated by relevant passages from the book, drawn by artist Dick Matena and read out by actor Gijs Scholten van Aschat. This gradually provides insight in the novel and its writer, and describes the present-day leaning towards religion of many Dutch people.","popularity":0.0633,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":67254,"logo_path":"/oV4xUvzWljGW1QVAa8qR2INNyN7.png","name":"Kaap Holland Film","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2008-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Het onzegbare","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pieter Verhoeff","original_name":"Pieter Verhoeff","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/qRWWNE7fKZveKKPOMwvZDQSIZ3i.jpg","credit_id":"62595d35f548361427dc0f9c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2081754,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Janneke Doolaard","original_name":"Janneke Doolaard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62595d49e0ec51195a3d56e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pieter Verhoeff","original_name":"Pieter Verhoeff","popularity":0.0932,"profile_path":"/qRWWNE7fKZveKKPOMwvZDQSIZ3i.jpg","credit_id":"62595d5569eb9000504a1da3","department":"Crew","job":"Script"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13093380","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
