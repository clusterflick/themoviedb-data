She multiplies the sentiment in 1+1, by N times maybe, to come up with her debut feature-length fictional film N+N. The wise grandpa and witty granddaughter from 1+1 continue to bless the city with bamboo shoots, while their own home in a rural village is torn down to give way for the high speed railway. They meet other people also jeopardized by the so-called development: artist left homeless because of factory revitalization, the middle-class striving for a living, the young generation born in the 1990s... They are all trying to hold on to the city's collective memory and every living tree.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9B1oaRfhQTaOEvfZv4xKeN3bvU0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"N+N","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2054461,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mo Lai Yan Chi","original_name":"Mo Lai Yan Chi","popularity":0.0499,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6256ce74323eba0e16fb5397","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":2500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9B1oaRfhQTaOEvfZv4xKeN3bvU0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1746}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
