That is, until he calls out to the God of his youth. Long days spent aching for home become long days talking with Jesus. After six years as a slave, Patrick hears the Holy Spirit urging him to make a daring escape from the Irish tribe and the druid priest who controls their ways. Once back home, Patrick first becomes a priest and then a bishop, but all this pales when he makes a stunning announcement: He will return to his kidnappers as a missionary! Find out why the man known as St. Patrick is credited with bringing the Gospel to Ireland in this episode of The Torchlighters.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/rCN8pv2i2QzPsoq9IVXI7FCgyho.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Torchlighters: The St. Patrick Story","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rCN8pv2i2QzPsoq9IVXI7FCgyho.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":708}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Only year given: https://christianhistoryinstitute.org/store/dvd/501869d/torchlighters-the-saint-patrick-story","release_date":"2020-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
