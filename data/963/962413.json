While in Paris he forms a secret society of men who are in a similar position. When he finally does decide to return home, his family and Muriel are at first shocked by his appearance, but they recover and try to make him feel comfortable and accepted. However, it's not before Howard begins to feel their actions are motivated more by pity than love, and when Arthur Wells, who was once Muriel's suitor, shows up one day and is greeted warmly and intimately by Muriel, Howard starts to think that his suspicions are justified.","popularity":0.2215,"poster_path":"/9DFBkFXSWogV8cqRaNAMPvFWsWC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23099,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sterling Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Face Value","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1174024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fritzi Ridgeway","original_name":"Fritzi Ridgeway","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":"/vgU9bkOCXUpg7WJYKVJbqBUsjAo.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Muriel Stanley","credit_id":"62575aa1c14fee0050acac75","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1369421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gene Gowing","original_name":"Gene Gowing","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Howard Crandall","credit_id":"62575aaea589020068f13f44","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2355446,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Baker","original_name":"Betty Baker","popularity":0.0522,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Calra","credit_id":"62575abda0b690009f3ba8ae","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1329660,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paddy O'Flynn","original_name":"Paddy O'Flynn","popularity":0.0493,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Bert","credit_id":"62575acb19ab590050295d45","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":980330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mower","original_name":"Jack Mower","popularity":0.1716,"profile_path":"/40SznvE0dvL39Fg2Q0pbAPx6V0o.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Arthur Wells","credit_id":"62575ada6bdec3009d3093b5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1145077,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwards Davis","original_name":"Edwards Davis","popularity":0.1152,"profile_path":"/tZwEJcv0w7ruzWPYkw4XGJcdthX.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Crandall Sr","credit_id":"62575ae87e9d5f0065625dc6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1357091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Bonner","original_name":"Joe Bonner","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Butler","credit_id":"62575af9d96c3c005179d0ac","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29808,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Florey","original_name":"Robert Florey","popularity":0.3391,"profile_path":"/cRX6qkTniwyr1Kt0yTWIlqHO25F.jpg","credit_id":"62575a88a0b690009f3ba7db","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1090876,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frances Guihan","original_name":"Frances Guihan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/hZ6HWiGFNgT80rLvOJHOar5Gykc.jpg","credit_id":"62575a91a3361200672e980a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0017859","wikidata_id":"Q60737786","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f74BFR1ApaquuTmgXx2jyGYBt5b.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/9DFBkFXSWogV8cqRaNAMPvFWsWC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1927-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
