Starting in 1999, the number of transplant centers in China increased by 300% in just 8 years, even though China has no effective national organ donation system. 1999 was the year the Chinese regime began persecuting adherents of the Falun Gong spiritual practice, sending hundreds of thousands to labor camps. Many of them were never seen again. Transplant medicine was developed to save lives. But in China, innocent people are being killed for their organs-so they can be sold for profit. Increasingly, doctors, congressmen, international politicians, human rights lawyers, journalists, and people around the world are raising awareness about forced organ harvesting.","popularity":0.1453,"poster_path":"/gAdKZBGZHIdxCrYkzTS2DwFyxnV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Prisoners of conscience-especially Falun Gong-are being killed for their organs.","title":"Killed for Organs: China's Secret State Transplant Business","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Chappell","original_name":"Chris Chappell","popularity":0.08,"profile_path":"/j0JMppf1PLPZl9PXkm5jALmew0i.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6621a066bb10570189d249ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1661507,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethan Gutmann","original_name":"Ethan Gutmann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6621a0710231f20163117dfb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1661512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Matas","original_name":"David Matas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6621a0918a88b20185ca9b8f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1661513,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damon Noto","original_name":"Damon Noto","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6621a0a47a3c52017d4ccf03","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1661516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Torsten Trey","original_name":"Torsten Trey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6621a0b2e4b5760164bc161e","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1661510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Kilgour","original_name":"David Kilgour","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"66987b2083a7797a2dbfcd28","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2185781,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mathias Magnason","original_name":"Mathias Magnason","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6621a049e640d60186c3943e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4661311,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Milena Fernandez","original_name":"Milena Fernandez","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6621a02ce640d600e5c28db9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4661309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tal Atzmon","original_name":"Tal Atzmon","popularity":0.055,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66219fff0d11f2014a012616","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4661312,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matt Gnaizda","original_name":"Matt Gnaizda","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6621a03b32cc2b01630ce3a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5713106","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1496,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gAdKZBGZHIdxCrYkzTS2DwFyxnV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
