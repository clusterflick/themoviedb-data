In the guise of a gossamer-light and supremely entertaining high-class comedy, Der Rosenkavalier touches on universal themes such as love, sex, marital fidelity and the changes that human relations undergo over time – and all of it set to music of the most glorious kind imaginable. With its stellar cast under the inspired direction of Harry Kupfer, the 2014 Salzburg Festival’s production of Der Rosenkavalier was one of the most internationally acclaimed interpretations of the work since the start of the new millennium. “A musical feast from beginning to end“ (Wiener Zeitung).","popularity":0.3974,"poster_path":"/abzjFAIXtUCrAwG2297dXHiXMAj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":215,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"R.
