Luc, a retired pediatrician and teacher in his eighties, lives with his son François, a pediatrician like his father, and François' wife Esther. Suffering and physically diminished, the old man has now decided to end his life. In a corrosive and sensitive verbal joust, he asks his son to end his days in privacy. The son then takes him on an existential and circus-like journey through the streets of Montreal where the father is supposed to go to his final destination, a hospital where he will be confronted with his ultimate wish: the choice between the finality of medical aid to die or a return to square one, the small pleasures of what remains of his life, alive.","popularity":0.3227,"poster_path":"/p8R0vLYfAwyOek0ofmUmbavBKv9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112512,"logo_path":"/hkUUtv1xk9NctdDZchXJfGSRbWC.png","name":"Filmoption International","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dying Alive","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85169,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcel Sabourin","original_name":"Marcel Sabourin","popularity":0.0859,"profile_path":"/ovRLik7TKrgk6K5Rj8aWZgkhH8n.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Luc","credit_id":"625744189a9e2000670b53f1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benoît Brière","original_name":"Benoît Brière","popularity":0.3084,"profile_path":"/apMvEh5iGfTy9Fo5qcP9iA9pgbE.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"François","credit_id":"6257442897a4e60051493c0d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":545244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Élise Guilbault","original_name":"Élise Guilbault","popularity":0.3736,"profile_path":"/3uyhiX5K3MI4HxhBbGMtAfENLy5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Esther","credit_id":"6493b1656b5fc200ca103185","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":67905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothée Berryman","original_name":"Dorothée Berryman","popularity":0.1622,"profile_path":"/zlc88cQfPJuNYCIJC3RYu5L0mVO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Pierrette","credit_id":"62574443c439c00096f767a1","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stéphane Jacques","original_name":"Stéphane Jacques","popularity":0.0632,"profile_path":"/rLWOmgzfYfm0due2db4vNQrbk0V.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6493b706cfe48f00c6fa4597","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":557091,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louise Forestier","original_name":"Louise Forestier","popularity":0.2082,"profile_path":"/8aP7dP4NS2598EwJf9kyJDIu4Sq.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Françoise (voice)","credit_id":"6493b718cfe48f010068f462","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2281259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caroline Quach","original_name":"Caroline Quach","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/g6O5gPWUWB497IQXedS2KgX6SkB.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Collègue","credit_id":"6493b73289b56100c564ac45","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2201891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-François Chicoine","original_name":"Jean-François Chicoine","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Père Noël (uncredited)","credit_id":"6493b7d9af6e94012564e8a2","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322143,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paul Cadieux","original_name":"Paul Cadieux","popularity":0.0559,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62573c5e7e9d5f00a6b8aafe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benoît Brière","original_name":"Benoît Brière","popularity":0.3084,"profile_path":"/apMvEh5iGfTy9Fo5qcP9iA9pgbE.jpg","credit_id":"62573cc2c14fee0065f8e975","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2201891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-François Chicoine","original_name":"Jean-François Chicoine","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6493b128af6e9400e7304abf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14557058","wikidata_id":"Q111678439","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1931,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/p8R0vLYfAwyOek0ofmUmbavBKv9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1287}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2021-12-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Mourir en vie | Bande-annonce officielle","key":"jumiIEL-irc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"published_at":"2021-12-04T19:03:57.000Z","id":"62573dfd7739410066555379"}]}}}
