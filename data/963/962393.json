This is what this documentary aims to show, by going back into the genesis and making of BPM (Beats per Minute), the 2017 Cannes Film Festival's grand prize winner, six times winner of the Cesar award. The film also shows how BPM (Beats per Minute) intertwines autobiographical memories and romantic lyricism, as close as possible to historical reality, and how Act Up was for Robin Campillo the founding personal experience that made him a filmmaker.","popularity":0.1768,"poster_path":"/yLZGTSRm6H8JxFB9454d9BJ5004.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46356,"logo_path":"/gwaoRQcAzCmsKv1z6L4D2nr0DBB.png","name":"Folamour Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il était une fois... « 120 battements par minute »","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17387,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robin Campillo","original_name":"Robin Campillo","popularity":0.0946,"profile_path":"/14ATcK9rAce5qEphUNBLXK0Rnr0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6260590a6eecee004f3be653","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1795151,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arnaud Valois","original_name":"Arnaud Valois","popularity":0.2178,"profile_path":"/yuSnJud8EnrJSDaaDpMQhWpsEPU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"himself","credit_id":"62605914d1a893005177a810","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2254764,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Didier Lestrade","original_name":"Didier Lestrade","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6260606be61e6d0050fc10f8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1778158,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Serge July","original_name":"Serge July","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/hnNQSrWlVNg7x9OXgsNNcd02ug1.jpg","credit_id":"626058c3db952d1264c2e8eb","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1859656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuelle Blanc","original_name":"Manuelle Blanc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62574c10c439c000519f2b42","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1859656,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manuelle Blanc","original_name":"Manuelle Blanc","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667e5e815dd249a52f45f3e9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1045852,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Agathe Cauvin","original_name":"Agathe Cauvin","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667e5e93287ea590461a0f3a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20316942","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/uUVDEm1uik8pKZl2zPdtYJjt53f.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":887,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/yLZGTSRm6H8JxFB9454d9BJ5004.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":626},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/damx7zmMUIg9sHgNzd0OuolUBi2.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/t7qL3r0gcOFJ33fq0YciFtxmyKE.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"ARTE","release_date":"2022-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
