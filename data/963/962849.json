Burma Diary focuses on the story of Tint Aung, a young Burmese man who was actively involved in the protest movement while in college. He is forced to flee from his home and take refuge in the jungles of the Burmese-Thailand border along with his wife and his two young daughters. As the film chronicles four harsh years of Tint Aung’s struggle to survive, it provides a passionate and at times heartbreaking study of the hopes of and the obstacles facing the Burmese democracy movement.","popularity":0.0512,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Burmese","iso_639_1":"my","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burma Diary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3507173,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeanne Hallacy","original_name":"Jeanne Hallacy","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/x84sGgcC7JQnhXxLahpFXe1psaJ.jpg","credit_id":"6258dc9a568463005014790a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0143160","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1997-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
