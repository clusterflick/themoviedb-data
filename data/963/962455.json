There under gentle coconut palms, he deliberates with colleagues who have managed to escape from their occupied homeland for the week-long meeting. Herman, a former political prisoner, has spent years working for liberation of his homeland. His journey to Australia, with forty-two other West Papuan asylum seekers, sparked global media attention in 2006. This is a documentary about non-violent resistance, courage in an undeclared war and loneliness in exile. It's about family, friendship, love, human rights, and great singing.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2011-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"West Papua: A Journey to Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3505713,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erin Morris","original_name":"Erin Morris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6257895981da3900565f6911","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1781053","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"ViBGYOR International Film Festival","release_date":"2011-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
