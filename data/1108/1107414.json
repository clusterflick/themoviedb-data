If they chose Indonesian, they were obliged to change their Chinese name into an Indonesian name. Still a taboo subject in Indonesia, this magical-realist documentary follows 87-year-old Indriati, who is haunted by her past name in the form of a silver bird that follows her everywhere she goes. As Indriati goes about her quiet routine, a bird sits on a windowsill, spying on her. Its silver skin is almost mythical in appearance.","popularity":0.1386,"poster_path":"/6LDD3HBjNfLilK8chB4AQdcfbRG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":198244,"logo_path":null,"name":"Umbra Motion Picture Company","origin_country":""},{"id":200169,"logo_path":"/xuhIbQNV8lJKIvbQi7ZJvO3cT3n.png","name":"Talamedia","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"},{"english_name":"Javanese","iso_639_1":"jv","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Grandmother Is A Bird","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3989113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Indriati","original_name":"Indriati","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Indriati","credit_id":"6427ea4c8a88b2009764ae9b","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3989114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Suwito","original_name":"Andrea Suwito","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6427ea81960cde0103a484aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3557719,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Finbar Somers","original_name":"Finbar Somers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"643c27e9da10f01b4464e1cc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1610757,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mandy Marahimin","original_name":"Mandy Marahimin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/pzjVVjGuDPsDcuvZ7mqMtg0TuyA.jpg","credit_id":"643c27e137806202eb1617e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142027,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Satrio Budiono","original_name":"Satrio Budiono","popularity":0.2051,"profile_path":"/wkPHKCNVvw9bb5PdHfUOIr4VdwA.jpg","credit_id":"643c2851d7a70a04cf168998","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1381950,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Thoersi Argeswara","original_name":"Thoersi Argeswara","popularity":0.0596,"profile_path":"/2WSaelXc8wOHSoS8a6L2bi5deVy.jpg","credit_id":"643c28443780620468161c23","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2087310,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Cundra Setiabudhi","original_name":"Cundra Setiabudhi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6440ca2263536a04df720aea","department":"Visual Effects","job":"VFX Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3989114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Suwito","original_name":"Andrea Suwito","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a4543dc1e5ed8bfc85ad2c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3989114,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Suwito","original_name":"Andrea Suwito","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67a4544777b8ced45666d766","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6LDD3HBjNfLilK8chB4AQdcfbRG.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jakarta Film Week","release_date":"2023-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jogja-NETPAC Asian Film Festival","release_date":"2022-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"My Grandmother is a Bird - trailer","key":"VYhEGC4D3RM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-10-30T03:25:41.000Z","id":"67a40fc24501b2f23366ccda"}]}}}
