Did you know that while at Tuskegee Institute he became one of the world's foremost experts in horticulture?\r In fact, George Washington Carver almost single-handedly reinvented land management in the South following the ravages of too much cotton and tobacco farming. He was so brilliant that Henry Ford and Thomas Edison tried to hire him, but he said no. Do you know why?\r Because he wasn't after fame or fortune.
