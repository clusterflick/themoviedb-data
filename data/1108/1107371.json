Because each unit of the exposition is so painstakingly conceptualized and nurtured, an audience is afforded a unique kind of purview on the elements as they are reconstituted in the more complex overlays. Thus the early, Magritte-like compositions of eye and sky establish basis for later more complicated efforts .... Color changes worked on given images (the bird, the sky) avoid the oversimplifications of hues/cues. Certain effects, as when clouds pass through the falling body which is outlined in flaming orange, can only be described as awesome. ... [A] work of immense dedication and exceptional skill.\" â€“ John Fell","popularity":0.0289,"poster_path":"/YpJaFNWzQObVzpR7UEFZF5hxnY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fall","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2191492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom DeWitt Ditto","original_name":"Tom DeWitt Ditto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6427a40635811d00d3cd1462","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":891,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/YpJaFNWzQObVzpR7UEFZF5hxnY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":594},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":933,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zBM0GFFsmHfrlmy7SSMyUshu8rs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":622}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1971-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
