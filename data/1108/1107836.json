They only know a big vendor whom they called the storyteller from the square. He told stories in exchange for valuable marbles that the Bubbleheads produce. During the preparations for Pluto's birthday, Saturn accidentally broke the gift that the Bubbleheads had carefully prepared for him. Saturn, realizing that he would be blamed for this mishap, angrily and arrogantly said, 'If anyone thinks differently, I will go to the end of the world and stay there so that I don't have to see anyone!' No one believed Saturn's words until the next day when he was nowhere to be found. Then they realized that he had seriously meant that he would go to the end of the world.\"","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bubbleheads - Journey to the end of the world","title":"En la Aventura del fin del Mundo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
