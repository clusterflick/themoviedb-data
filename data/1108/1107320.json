Three years on, same-sex couples still face challenges that heterosexual couples do not: some have trouble becoming legal guardians for their children; others must travel abroad to start a family; some are even rejected when applying for legal marriage status. As such, legalization was just another small step forward in the fight for equality.\r This 90-minute documentary shows how different same-sex couples fight for the life they desire and deserve. They may be fighting different battles, but they share one thing in common: the belief that the sun will shine after this rain.","popularity":0.1135,"poster_path":"/55mzgzNua6YIodFDDgmOgU08DJQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2023-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Together, Stronger in the Rain","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Together, Stronger in the Rain","type":"English Title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3988668,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Lien Song-Pei","original_name":"Peter Lien Song-Pei","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"642779ae8de0ae00f4bf7ffc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3988667,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allen Tsai You-Xun","original_name":"Allen Tsai You-Xun","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6427799fa3e4ba011149b5d7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"zh","file_path":"/1hwI46ajEL7FkOSyjUfzoCsghNq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/twxZfKkuUUb3IGuNYO15makMwyx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/55mzgzNua6YIodFDDgmOgU08DJQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":158718,"name":"lgbt"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"0+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"Taiwanplus Online","release_date":"2023-08-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
