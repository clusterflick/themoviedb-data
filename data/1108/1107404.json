In creating these new sequences, Kremer comes to recognize that the exercise effortlessly draws cultural and historical parallels in twentieth-century American life that echo in present-day America. The editorial mashups weave a tangled web of social and cinematic history that root our notions of Americana in the mythology of the desert. As Kremer expounds in his narration on these often astonishing and sometimes shocking associations, his very personal ties to the subject matter become manifest.","popularity":1.0495,"poster_path":"/5GD6fThtC89B8SU6KdJ1S3lFvn2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
