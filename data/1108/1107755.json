Performed during a tumultuous time at the Newport Jazz Festival, where just the day prior police used teargas and water hoses to control a drunken, riotous crowd, this extraordinary, historic set includes old blues standards as well as new Waters compositions. Despite the somewhat dangerous and unruly atmosphere at the festival, Waters and his electric blues band delivered an exquisite, confident performance. Featuring an all-star band with the likes of the legendary James Cotton, Otis Spann and John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters at Newport 1960 would go on to become one of the most revered albums in modern day Chicago blues history.","popularity":0.1735,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1960-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Muddy Waters at Newport","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76146,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Muddy Waters","original_name":"Muddy Waters","popularity":0.1078,"profile_path":"/4en6WXo8nUc5z2w3RTpUC4OcOST.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6428d3ad960cde012634ac19","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lee Hooker","original_name":"John Lee Hooker","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/lz69wugVkbqqKb0p0vbXEgKhHmB.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6428d3a30f365500f1c222e8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3493479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Cotton","original_name":"James Cotton","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/zWIXmWRuLNiCvxmYmsgxaclPefs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6428d3bb960cde012634ac28","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1125294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otis Spann","original_name":"Otis Spann","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6428d3c501b1ca00777ab986","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1960-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
