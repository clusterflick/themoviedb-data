In 1989, ACT UP, a diverse, non-partisan group of individuals united in anger and committed to direct action to end the AIDS crisis, spawned DIVA-TV (Damned Interfering Video Activists) to organize independent video makers involved in AIDS activism. Working collectively to produce images of ACT UP's often massive, always colorful, protests, DIVA-TV is a prime example of how to use television as a tool for empowerment and organizing with an activist organization. BE A DIVA! is a compilation of works documenting the dynamic political activities of ACT UP.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Be a DIVA!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3693910,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"DIVA TV","original_name":"DIVA TV","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6427eabd9cc67b0571574866","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
