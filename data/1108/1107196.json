The story echoes her life. Through the mise en abyme, the film challenges this troubling border where fiction merges with reality, where life merges with art. A naturalistic approach that questions intimacy, drama, passion, work and love, and seeks to shed light on the most vibrant, timeless and universal aspects of life.","popularity":0.0668,"poster_path":"/mRoO4DtGQERpmbp4kSh6fk5imAB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52600,"logo_path":"/l9TgnrwPvRnCAroWKVW8RdaVyQf.png","name":"Bellota Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":43244,"logo_path":"/cOymUIboPJTfT3TUPDGSwQg7QOe.png","name":"Stemal Entertainment","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Zola Experience","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1653029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianluca Matarrese","original_name":"Gianluca Matarrese","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65260673caef2d011dc1df84","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4315447,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anne Barbot","original_name":"Anne Barbot","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6526066507216645b7c94fe1","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4315448,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Benoit Dallongeville","original_name":"Benoit Dallongeville","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6526066c0cb33516f880a3c4","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1653029,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gianluca Matarrese","original_name":"Gianluca Matarrese","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64272107c04429026b12cbb3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28502012","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/m0aRS6UzgyH9gz8HLLULtA6od2v.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ddF5SOES5jJPGt9ySrdUQXvytgO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mRoO4DtGQERpmbp4kSh6fk5imAB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/isRHJA7CiLZXaMljORlWpmSUTJr.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":960}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Shanghai International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
