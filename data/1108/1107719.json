At some point in life, it was everyone’s home. Many of the house’s tenants were prominent in different fields of artistic and social activities, so it was the place where amazing books, film scripts, photographs, illustrations, music, shows, films were made… The house, originally built by Slobodan Praljak, hosted, among others, Abdulah Sidran, Goran Babić, the Ayllu group, Igor Kordej, Goran Pavelić Pipo, Milan Trenc, Davor Slamnig and Pjer Žardin, with Mirko Ilić, Vilim Matula, Davor Gobac and frequent visitors. The tenants later scattered across the world: South America, Canada, New York, The Hague, Belgrade, Sarajevo and Ljubljana. Following their destinies, the current house owner and film director Pero Kvesić speaks about the past as well as the present time.
