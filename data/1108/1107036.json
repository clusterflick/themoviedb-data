Maxim is an idealistic Nova who, along with his people, yearns to resolve the corruption in his society-a corruption that has largely originated from the Corebots. Over time, however, he begins to see that his fellow Novas employ the very same concepts of unfairness and corruption to achieve their goals. As tensions rise between the two groups, Maxim finds himself struggling to choose between his allegiance to his people and his dawning realization that the Corebots are not the boogeymen that the Novas have made them out to be.","popularity":0.0999,"poster_path":"/bMIWSq8YmUGb4jelagvlw3oYDyc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Torn Seas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2597894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eli Harris","original_name":"Eli Harris","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/qoLiB1NfgQKkNvmQp70JhMOcTmy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Tank","credit_id":"6426c2f101b1ca00e3aa0340","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3623692,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anjelica Jayes","original_name":"Anjelica Jayes","popularity":0.0764,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Dawn","credit_id":"6426c30e01b1ca00e3aa0352","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3987590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Soltura","original_name":"Dave Soltura","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Jammick","credit_id":"6426c37da3e4ba0095f23f9b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3987581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Boisvert","original_name":"Richard Boisvert","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6426c2938de0ae00f4bf3e5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3987581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Boisvert","original_name":"Richard Boisvert","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6426c2abc0442901f001ab3c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27096722","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bMIWSq8YmUGb4jelagvlw3oYDyc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
