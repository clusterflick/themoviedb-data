Discovered in 1850 by the French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, this place shelters a treasure of which a part is preserved in the Louvre. The collapse of the ceiling of one of the galleries had however prevented the archaeologist from venturing into the entire necropolis. More than 170 years later, the museum's Egyptologists are continuing the work of their famous predecessor. Investigating the cult of the Apis bull and the mysterious rituals that surrounded it, the team is especially looking for access to the unexplored parts, which have at least eight burial chambers, with the hope of finding intact tombs.","popularity":0.3382,"poster_path":"/gIfxDMZeYimyKlnM6YjIQCDiP2z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67826,"logo_path":"/eCzRNoTfdv9RDD0aqPeGYgmIG9d.png","name":"Iliade Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":109640,"logo_path":"/6BOdzFLmLiupdlSVGkiwlTflvkT.png","name":"Les Films de l'Odyssée","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":34766,"logo_path":"/atA5jWdLJ5tgyKQ5dJ6FcYLQsUo.png","name":"Musée du Louvre","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ägypten - Das Grab der heiligen Stiere","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1535930,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frédéric Wilner","original_name":"Frédéric Wilner","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64291368c5840d0097a1b412","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt27486749","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/y2hSewTnRP8T3zqhuT6LtepboZy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/gIfxDMZeYimyKlnM6YjIQCDiP2z.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":157894,"name":"ancient egypt"},{"id":163347,"name":"egyptology"},{"id":191933,"name":"pharaons"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
