Desire Lines are the official name given to the unofficial paths created as a consequence of erosion by human or animal footfall. These paths usually represent the shortest or most easily navigated route between an origin and destination. What do desire lines say about human nature and our attitude towards the changing climate? Are we doomed to always take the path of least resistance? Or can we still be saved by collectively forging a new path together?","popularity":0.0614,"poster_path":"/nVfiwReYslJPy2BCHBfDLqDTFjK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desire Lines","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1614232,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Duncan Cowles","original_name":"Duncan Cowles","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/pNAF80vI40LZCTWOXRubCfceSbj.jpg","credit_id":"6428ac4a960cde009a978242","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nVfiwReYslJPy2BCHBfDLqDTFjK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
