We have placed extra emphasis on following the narrative. Exploring what the movie tells us, and what can be inferred. If the novelisation diverges, we'll compare both versions. As always, we shall bring in extra sources. Mostly books released around the same time as the movie. Some from before, and others from years afterward. These will also help us with our technical analysis.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":720,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Very Brief Analysis: Attack of the Clones (Reel 1 of 3)","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6021136,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"The Bread Circus","original_name":"The Bread Circus","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6998fae5fdfefb293b00ab51","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.782,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n9aY7xMpFZUK625GBIIiye88OdL.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1283},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/4yXrnwOn05kfY59CdbQGmUfF8aZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A Very Brief Analysis: Attack of the Clones (Reel 1 of 3)","key":"HYVVVlvwOUA","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2025-05-06T16:30:14.000Z","id":"6998fb8892724dcb67f555b2"}]}}}
