This is how Ralph Fiennes sums up the plot of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s opera, inspired by Pushkin’s work. A jaded young dandy, Onegin sets shy Tatiana on fire at first sight. Overcoming her reticence, she writes him a passionate love letter.  Alas, he brutally refuses, giving her a lecture on morality. However, years later, after a duel, he falls in love with the young woman who is now Prince Gremin’s wife. Will she yield to his advances?  Fascinated by Russian culture and attuned to the dramatic intensity of Tchaikovsky’s music, Ralph Fiennes is directing his first opera. If he chooses to use pictorial simplicity to evoke the Russian countryside or a ballroom, it is all the better to emphasise the emotions of the characters, as complex as they are modern.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/5y6d2or8I2kEzuEBIjNYINIO6eV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":"/bGLlMG6AcL7HcpeOUuFX5XbYJQN.png","name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2026-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":200,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eugene Onegin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Pinkhasovich","original_name":"Boris Pinkhasovich","popularity":0.8422,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Eugene Onegin","credit_id":"6998f138597be553b3f55592","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2148282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ruzan Mantashyan","original_name":"Ruzan Mantashyan","popularity":0.1286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Tatiana","credit_id":"6998f1471df1afcbb134505e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2575421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bogdan Volkov","original_name":"Bogdan Volkov","popularity":0.4161,"profile_path":"/dmrNeoUmJibA1w0uchwkPBW4A0h.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Lensky","credit_id":"6998f1573f210bc1055ae5e1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4272830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marvic Monreal","original_name":"Marvic Monreal","popularity":0.068,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Olga","credit_id":"6998f16bae6efc1eca345075","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Tsymbalyuk","original_name":"Alexander Tsymbalyuk","popularity":0.6243,"profile_path":"/ofWx0UDQ0jxEpabqK4cXwFEo6ph.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Prince Gremin","credit_id":"6998f17b4089b0e39527e834","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5469,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ralph Fiennes","original_name":"Ralph Fiennes","popularity":7.9609,"profile_path":"/u29BOqiV5GCQ8k8WUJM50i9xlBf.jpg","credit_id":"6998f0d0b48ca14a6d74665f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1281066,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky","original_name":"Пётр Ильич Чайковский","popularity":0.2122,"profile_path":"/zTnrtuLddN6KYU3gVVepEiAsgek.jpg","credit_id":"6998f0e7a3384be24627e86a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1633621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Semyon Bychkov","original_name":"Semyon Bychkov","popularity":0.7096,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6998f101561ab9971c345058","department":"Sound","job":"Conductor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.704,"height":1421,"iso_3166_1":"FR","iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/5y6d2or8I2kEzuEBIjNYINIO6eV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ru","note":"","release_date":"2026-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"EUGÈNE ONÉGUINE by Piotr Ilyitch Tchaïkovski (teaser)","key":"5mywf1T0Zp0","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Teaser","official":false,"published_at":"2026-01-26T13:11:00.000Z","id":"6998efedfdcef234b3345053"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"RALPH FIENNES about EUGÈNE ONÉGUINE (interview)","key":"yZMgWV6cCeM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-04-02T08:51:34.000Z","id":"6998f1d2098a97301df55599"}]}}}
