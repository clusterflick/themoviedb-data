They weren’t chasing fame or following a mapped route because there wasn’t one. They were Trailblazing. What began as a homegrown adventure became a journey that reflected the rugged beauty of the Southwest. Accompanied by two mules, a stray dog, and a handful of topo maps, they faced snowstorms, irate ranchers, mule mishaps, a closed Grand Canyon, and the constant challenge of finding water. Their trek was a rebellion against convenience.  Today the Arizona Trail, a National Scenic Trail, offers that same spirit of discovery, but its roots trace back to Native Peoples, prospectors, outlaws, and two brothers who believed that if no path existed, they would create one.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mNJuQGItbvAfREZJWZZGkQVK2Ul.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126071,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quantum Leap Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bound by brotherhood.
