The principal refused to admit Mamie Tape, citing school board policy barring Chinese children from attending the city’s public schools. The Tape family sued the principal and took the case to the California Supreme Court in 1885. School officials defended their position by arguing that the California constitution declared Chinese to be “dangerous to the well-being of the state,” and thus the city had no obligation to educate Chinese students.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mamie Tape And The Fight For Equality In Education 1885-1995","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3514400,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Loni Ding","original_name":"Loni Ding","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6998e493d67dc97ed356b526","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2000-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
