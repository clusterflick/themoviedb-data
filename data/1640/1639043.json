She lives and works there, along with Shin Kyungok, an interior designer. Shin is also the landlord. The office of Hong Sangsoo's production company was briefly located on the top floor of the building. Years later, he had an idea to make a film there. We asked Hong Shinae to show us around the building and tell us about her experience during the production of Walk Up. She sent us this short video.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/r859yTQxPqDf3wFkTD12Pfqdcxe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2023-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"WALKING UP","title":"Walking Up","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3142491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hong Shinae","original_name":"홍신애","popularity":0.2709,"profile_path":"/aQLBaYveUdUNQTKvlD0geJQmUxo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"6998992a58268c374aba3aaa","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3142491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hong Shinae","original_name":"홍신애","popularity":0.2709,"profile_path":"/aQLBaYveUdUNQTKvlD0geJQmUxo.jpg","credit_id":"6998994c7c8c2ee61ec99a20","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3142491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hong Shinae","original_name":"홍신애","popularity":0.2709,"profile_path":"/aQLBaYveUdUNQTKvlD0geJQmUxo.jpg","credit_id":"6998995a73730a27eec999bf","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6020461,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mimi Park","original_name":"Mimi Park","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6998998f183f6665aa13c1fb","department":"Crew","job":"Translator"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3142491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hong Shinae","original_name":"홍신애","popularity":0.2709,"profile_path":"/aQLBaYveUdUNQTKvlD0geJQmUxo.jpg","credit_id":"699899f2618e8f64aca72d0d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":759,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7Cjcl9kK5kNX06GjpRKy7Q6twi2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1349}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/r859yTQxPqDf3wFkTD12Pfqdcxe.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"Included in the Blu-ray and DVD release of Walk Up","release_date":"2023-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
