Structured in three acts, the film traces their journey from the decision to serve, through the realities of war, to the transition back to civilian life. Veterans reflect on their motivations for joining, their expectations of service, and the profound personal costs of combat, including trauma, loss, injury, and struggles with mental health. The documentary also explores the challenges of leaving the military, losing structure and identity, and rebuilding life beyond the uniform. Through candid testimony and expert insight, the film highlights the power of community and shared experience in helping Veterans navigate life after service.","popularity":0.1143,"poster_path":"/r6iAL0vDXmAloQEcX1SPifzIU63.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"After 9/11, they answered the call.
