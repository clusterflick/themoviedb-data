Cleopatra and António lock themselves in the mausoleum while Brazil is recolonized. The word colonization comes to life and nature reacts to the destruction of the Earth from the desire for immortality. On the verge of his death, António asks for a “lullaby”. In a funeral mating dance, two historical and tyrannical characters dream, in the midst of war, of a non-binary policy of Love. In this de-colonial and queer rewriting of Shakespeare’s tragic play, Egypt is Brazil and Rome is Portugal.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/h3qu5vl8ui4NwtVtoDTVpqOOBPa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23725,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2025-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cleópatra & António","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1505930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Gonçalves","original_name":"Victor Gonçalves","popularity":0.5191,"profile_path":"/3oCux8N9htLVYWycK82xzpPAEOD.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6998e675dfcce5c8c918eff4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3405823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Bragà","original_name":"Diego Bragà","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6998e6a22e1448310d56b547","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3405823,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diego Bragà","original_name":"Diego Bragà","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6998e511951ad512b4ecc3b5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":889,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/h3qu5vl8ui4NwtVtoDTVpqOOBPa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"31st Caminhos do Cinema Português","release_date":"2025-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
