An unexpected event forces Wilfred to break out of his unremarkable life to perform a heroic act and save another human being’s life. In this black and white Jacques Tati-esque homage to a laconic anti-hero, Gotanda references one of the most tragic periods in San Francisco history.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kiss","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2111140,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Philip Kan Gotanda","original_name":"Philip Kan Gotanda","popularity":0.3805,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6998dcc74453c8a340c99c69","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
