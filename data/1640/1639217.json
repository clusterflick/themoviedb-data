Since Mogh's capture would dishonor Worf and his own son, Worf is reluctant to believe the alien's claim but it upsets him. However, following an accident, Data has a dream-like experience that involves his creator and Data approaches Worf to ask about a time Worf himself had a hallucination during a Klingon ritual. Worf realizes that it is important to learn the truth about his father.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/fN9bwmIVpiDDp7W4DcPOkyRj44A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9223,"logo_path":"/40qzTBM38vokoWhLKurficZ5syV.png","name":"Paramount Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Star Trek: The Next Generation - Birthright","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Stewart","original_name":"Patrick Stewart","popularity":2.6398,"profile_path":"/ufqtnLh3JJjPbEgxEag3MM5nZyv.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Capt.
