After the sudden death of their musician father, filmmaker Shona Buschlen and her younger brother Eddie, a jazz trumpet player, return to a performance space where their father once played. In the early stages of grief, music becomes difficult to hear, no longer comforting but a reminder of absence. Over time, these feelings begin to shift. Through archival recordings of their father’s bass and live trumpet improvisations by Eddie, the film creates a call and answer across time, tracing how sound becomes a way to sit with grief rather than escape it. Blending voiceover, childhood footage, and sound-driven editing, A Song For My Father explores grief not as something to be resolved, but as something lived with, where healing comes from allowing yourself to feel.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/hSdKLLbubrTt7Gdk90YpnGZcqFV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Lessons in forgetting, lessons in remembering, to listen.","title":"A Song For My Father","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6020698,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eddie Buschlen","original_name":"Eddie Buschlen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6998bcfab32caf1d80666ade","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6020705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shona Buschlen","original_name":"Shona Buschlen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6998bd1d864c80684ec998a5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4140176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Squires","original_name":"James Squires","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":"/pHbloKbKh8l7r4b8wLXXHasgn3n.jpg","credit_id":"6998bd530d9067e3c63028b6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5123084,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Naomi Faye Porter","original_name":"Naomi Faye Porter","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6998bd70acbc0b2ccdab958d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6020705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shona Buschlen","original_name":"Shona Buschlen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6998bd8e40f452b2f0d2cf07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6020705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shona Buschlen","original_name":"Shona Buschlen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6998bda41d50f2b0293029e3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4425092,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Owen Broome","original_name":"Owen Broome","popularity":0.1431,"profile_path":"/keaIc1qFvRXyP6UFYCoHr0ygMn9.jpg","credit_id":"6998bdfffda0e02d92302a70","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6020732,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jacqueline Jurca","original_name":"Jacqueline Jurca","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6998be649fefbc1ae1d2d004","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5868177,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Seth Fry","original_name":"Seth Fry","popularity":0.0848,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6998be8160dbd2469fab9382","department":"Editing","job":"Assistant Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6020736,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Arisha Gowan","original_name":"Arisha Gowan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6998bea25371a35c68a72d46","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4140176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Squires","original_name":"James Squires","popularity":0.0551,"profile_path":"/pHbloKbKh8l7r4b8wLXXHasgn3n.jpg","credit_id":"6998beb949d815d4bcc99d70","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3976375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Picken","original_name":"Christian Picken","popularity":0.0759,"profile_path":"/wNl3lWDT54gR42bsOosZxBuDzdd.jpg","credit_id":"6998bed6a80bbb25343029cb","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5865099,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Coen Gagnon","original_name":"Coen Gagnon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6998beff8092320597a72d10","department":"Camera","job":"BTS Photographer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.782,"height":1696,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/i74lLjlKII7r1f4SiGOXhqECBm7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3022}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hSdKLLbubrTt7Gdk90YpnGZcqFV.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lSYpRcdJIrM3iMvescFKnfSIRkn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1416,"name":"jazz"},{"id":365525,"name":"grief & loss"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
