Set during Holy Week in a provincial Filipino town, the story follows a young woman whose innocence is tested when her father invites a priest-in-training to live in their home. Underneath the romance lies an air of suspense, where faith, desire, and secrecy collide. With nods to classic cinema, Rosario explores the fragile line between devotion and temptation.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/10a8NpceeKbPiCmUoXYPVY0nAY1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":270021,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unsalted Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2025-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosario","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3836471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Jellyn","original_name":"Kate Jellyn","popularity":0.0679,"profile_path":"/fBkwPYo1geiRS5KmtQPIdemnWwk.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Rosario","credit_id":"69992a742140beddc2b2822d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5369136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ariel Alud-ud","original_name":"Ariel Alud-ud","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Brother Mike","credit_id":"69992a83f9380e9cace8e868","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5417137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin Rodriguez","original_name":"Edwin Rodriguez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Don Mariano","credit_id":"69992aa48e55193d6280e30c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5417121,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meng Canlas","original_name":"Meng Canlas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tiya Maria","credit_id":"69992ab9322a0c1b3280e2e7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":6021457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Khaira Dominique","original_name":"Khaira Dominique","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Margarita","credit_id":"69992acbfa5437ac42590161","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5417064,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Clark Cameron Marcelo","original_name":"Clark Cameron Marcelo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69992af7d7c2ba399afc1bf9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5417064,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Clark Cameron Marcelo","original_name":"Clark Cameron Marcelo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69992b06e1a8593cd06a2e21","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt37981078","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/10a8NpceeKbPiCmUoXYPVY0nAY1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":320552,"name":"filipino mythology"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tl","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
