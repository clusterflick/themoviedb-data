Over 26 years in prison cannot crush the spirit of this determined African-American woman, despite the injustices she has experienced, first at the hands of a duplicitous boyfriend who beat her and forced her into prostitution, and later by prosecutors who cornered her into a life behind bars for her connection to the murder of her abuser. Her story takes an unexpected turn two decades later when a pair of rookie land-use attorneys cut their teeth on her case -- and attract global attention to the troubled intersection of domestic violence and criminal justice.","popularity":0.134,"poster_path":"/sqMCUXIF4WOgyv56GIXtiXXieLf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Life Sentence
