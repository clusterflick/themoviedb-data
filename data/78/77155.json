Before they crash they shoot the weapon like a torpedo from the ship to some location on Earth. There is only one survivor of the crash, the least intelligent of the crew, who before they were attacked was using a highly advanced mop to clean the floor. He must locate the Deathsphere before the Ghastorians do. He gets confused for someone else and becomes part of a group having a beach party while the Deathsphere gets mistaken for a volleyball which some young people play with. The Maltrusian alien along with the Deathsphere go off with a group that separates from the party to go up to the mysterious abandoned house of the deceased Mr. Willoughby.","popularity":0.2903,"poster_path":"/t5zf9rU2rXWqWMsTlWNFiaOTCPH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Find the Death-Sphere, Dr. Bateman...","title":"Alien Beach Party Massacre","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2694615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Eineigl","original_name":"John Eineigl","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Dr. Bateman","credit_id":"5ef88e2be93e950032b71cf0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":122805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Fite","original_name":"Mark Fite","popularity":0.1785,"profile_path":"/qUbqKE14GAUdRhYqNcGzDkt1yi9.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jeff","credit_id":"5ef88e3f27d9cc0036ac627b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stacey Havener","original_name":"Stacey Havener","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Babs","credit_id":"5ef88e58a284eb00388fbb6d","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2862681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Gizzarelli","original_name":"Andy Gizzarelli","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fb70eb1b76cbb003c4a5051","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0313187","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":1791,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t5zf9rU2rXWqWMsTlWNFiaOTCPH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1196}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
