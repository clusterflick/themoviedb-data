If you've got some cash and you need a car, D-Stacks (White) can hook you up with one of the hottest rides around. His crew may be a little crazy, but they won't be happy until the customer leaves satisfied. Their latest customer is Boogie White, a local hot-shot who just mistakenly left $10,000 in the trunk of his rented car. When the money goes missing, it falls on D-Stacks to make sure it's replaced. Now, if D-Stacks can just convince one of his talented employees to turn out a hit single and stage a local show, maybe they can raise enough money to pay Boogie back. But they've only got 72 hours to make it happen, and should they fail D-Stacks stands to lose more than just his reputation as a reliable businessman. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","popularity":1.4691,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rent a Car","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1543739","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2010-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
