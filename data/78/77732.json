Hosted by Roger Moore. In the Footsteps of the Holy Family traces the journey of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph after Christ’s birth, visiting the sites made sacred by their presence. A compelling blend of history, science and faith, it examines everything from the fate of the three Magi to a spectacular vision of the Virgin Mary at Zeitoun, Egypt, in 1968, offering a fresh look at one of the most important chapters in human history.","popularity":0.4863,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18441,"logo_path":"/rJmXT9sgCKG8uSUO1T93kOTfAzm.png","name":"A+E Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Footsteps of the Holy Family","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":119689,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Bouson","original_name":"Michael Bouson","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Surgeon","credit_id":"579e4ed992514110ac00228f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":572094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Deen","original_name":"Kevin Deen","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Luke","credit_id":"579e4eed92514110ac002299","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1659315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Doty","original_name":"Colin Doty","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Biblical Expert","credit_id":"579e4f10c3a3684b8a003a2f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1465274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramona DuBarry","original_name":"Ramona DuBarry","popularity":0.0811,"profile_path":"/Ag2zpgUYUkX1gqsSskLTXLi0uQG.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Mother","credit_id":"579e4f2b925141106e00223b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1265328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Duffau","original_name":"Mike Duffau","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Soldier","credit_id":"579e4f3ec3a3683ced00258b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1421387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnnie Johnson III","original_name":"Johnnie Johnson III","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"General Thomas","credit_id":"579e4f59c3a3684bd7003c19","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96749,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"G.
