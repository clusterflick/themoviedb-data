Pierette, however, leads a charmed life; while her son is forced to work the graveyard shift at a factory due to poor job prospects, she's able to find a job right away at a high school. Pierrette soon reintroduces herself to her 23-year-old daughter and one-time best friend, trying to use her charm to skate over years of neglect. She just as suddenly finds a new beau, Ackerman, and starts helping him out with his antique business. However, what would seem like a simple matter -- buying a clock from an elderly woman -- soon turns out to be very complicated and fraught with consequence.","popularity":0.4924,"poster_path":"/NdRFpFmHFDPZHDFJOSRqAENJbJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83265,"logo_path":null,"name":"TSH","origin_country":""},{"id":83,"logo_path":"/9OQ0rm55xtlgX7KcAKMUePJSrQc.png","name":"France 2 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":46596,"logo_path":null,"name":"Euripide Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Dilettante","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":36,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Catherine Frot","original_name":"Catherine Frot","popularity":0.5073,"profile_path":"/mLYcrvglYGoPEjwBB5jyUe2ku8e.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pierrette Dumortier","credit_id":"52fe497bc3a368484e12db6b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":582511,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sébastien Cotterot","original_name":"Sébastien Cotterot","popularity":0.0593,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Eric","credit_id":"52fe497bc3a368484e12db6f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":81786,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Schulz","original_name":"Barbara Schulz","popularity":0.3333,"profile_path":"/w0vEnFq3NQrMWC9rlgDs8A3H9cz.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Nathalie","credit_id":"52fe497bc3a368484e12db73","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":146722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Morin","original_name":"Christian Morin","popularity":0.0895,"profile_path":"/7xDtdIE8N2G0RldWh4RoxtZZdeS.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Edmond Rambert","credit_id":"52fe497bc3a368484e12db77","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Christine Barrault","original_name":"Marie-Christine Barrault","popularity":0.314,"profile_path":"/uKaE6e4u3IuhhYslqtmICc2GssY.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Thérèse Rambert","credit_id":"52fe497bc3a368484e12db7b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":559677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Odette Laure","original_name":"Odette Laure","popularity":0.1366,"profile_path":"/1Jq4KxYEJRnqzczsL7z1SMN80gA.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Zoé de la Tresmondière","credit_id":"52fe497bc3a368484e12db7f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":268826,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophie Forte","original_name":"Sophie Forte","popularity":0.0645,"profile_path":"/A9XOtTcASKXBtMlE3TghNvMcTwm.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"la secrétaire de la directrice","credit_id":"52fe497bc3a368484e12db83","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18559,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Desailly","original_name":"Jean Desailly","popularity":0.2835,"profile_path":"/fMR14DvAHQE0Ruv34alWv49VNKV.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Edmond Thibault","credit_id":"545bd59ac3a368535d0020dd","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":402505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Clément Thomas","original_name":"Clément Thomas","popularity":0.1113,"profile_path":"/9KXcDGqklhDzd1G6SkrZrVhZSb8.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"l'avocat de Pierrette","credit_id":"52fe497bc3a368484e12db8b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-François Balmer","original_name":"Jean-François Balmer","popularity":0.1468,"profile_path":"/5CLhlqqDJMjTx8t9ZkAyNwRBzQR.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Le président du tribunal","credit_id":"52fe497bc3a368484e12db8f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":266665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Dacqmine","original_name":"Jacques Dacqmine","popularity":0.1831,"profile_path":"/vrdtoKZ3D5YbHv91S8mgiYAQEcb.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"M.
