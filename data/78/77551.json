But unknown to them, the family inheritance has passed from grandmother to granddaughter for centuries-and Rebecca has a long reach from the grave to assure that the line is unbroken. The first weekend in the mansion is a party for the three Naiberts and their friends-but one by one, they vanish without a trace. Is death the punishment for violating Rebecca's spell? Are the demons that beset the young people real-or only reflections of their own fear? Is it murder, violence from another dimension, or madness? The answer lives in the reflections.","popularity":0.7608,"poster_path":"/ieXjXRLoOLXg2WmvByzaXtwbbVt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Passing","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":246409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Crystal Day","original_name":"Crystal Day","popularity":0.1174,"profile_path":"/xdblp2Wd3M2TERIbLnHPjI2rQQy.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Elizabeth Naibert","credit_id":"52fe4972c3a368484e12bcfd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":139048,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Ann Bennett","original_name":"Elizabeth Ann Bennett","popularity":0.1781,"profile_path":"/2PUlnb9ZADG59hnltK6ObzEXwCP.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Holly","credit_id":"52fe4972c3a368484e12bd01","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":403314,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Jason Hamer","original_name":"Jason Hamer","popularity":0.0877,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Josh","credit_id":"52fe4972c3a368484e12bd05","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tara Carroll","original_name":"Tara Carroll","popularity":0.1103,"profile_path":"/8nd78lt723Q3HHja0JWdYAILJo5.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Cyndy","credit_id":"5727c38ac3a3687a00000367","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1614471,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Upton","original_name":"Sam Upton","popularity":0.1109,"profile_path":"/nZgyasYIwQ75OPo6Aw6IcAsJAT5.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Ray Naibert","credit_id":"5727c4d3c3a3682dee001502","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1223712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colleen Shannon","original_name":"Colleen Shannon","popularity":0.135,"profile_path":"/6aJcWhhhrUWBVJu2TXU5yTiAK2R.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mandy","credit_id":"5727c7c2c3a36821480019a0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":939166,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Gleason","original_name":"Brian Gleason","popularity":0.2152,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Jack Naibert","credit_id":"5727c886c3a36821480019bf","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":964614,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonia Rockwell","original_name":"Sonia Rockwell","popularity":0.193,"profile_path":"/4y1kaIqaCOlotjwgHV06zHPRIIm.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Emilie","credit_id":"5727c951c3a3682dee00159d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Gleason","original_name":"Paul Gleason","popularity":0.9136,"profile_path":"/a7PJofFcVpDxw2wAak1d56J7L4k.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Det.
