Its mature and emotive textures dominate this show, which means if you're hoping to see Cave whipping himself into a frenzy while Blixa Bargeld rattles the walls with his guitar, well, you're out of luck. However, this footage proves that, in more subtle form, Cave is still a magnetic and compelling performer and that the Bad Seeds have grown into a singularly gifted ensemble who bring just the right amount of drama and force to Cave's superb songs (with guitarist Mick Harvey and violinist Warren Ellis taking top honors at this performance). Beautifully shot, intelligently edited, and boasting crisp and full-bodied audio, God Is in the House is a fine document of Cave and his collaborators on a good night.","popularity":0.2486,"poster_path":"/t7XpbNCuyzWNaXwTo0SuSfhoxfh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129395,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mute Records","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":70306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mute Films","origin_country":""},{"id":94060,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mute/EMI","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds: God Is in the House","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Cave","original_name":"Nick Cave","popularity":0.5933,"profile_path":"/rPn6Y3j3IOHRlTxCW2wHAyU6TYt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe4965c3a368484e1292f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":996617,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blixa Bargeld","original_name":"Blixa Bargeld","popularity":0.3437,"profile_path":"/k2wQ6aYnDCiGAP4s7BfV3ewypDS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"578208b79251417b8e0048bd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1041310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martyn Casey","original_name":"Martyn Casey","popularity":0.1548,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d9b9e6d35a61e0032237a27","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39517,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Warren Ellis","original_name":"Warren Ellis","popularity":0.2411,"profile_path":"/9HcrfggZbfE01CRbSTUyKUzbuX5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d9b9e7415c636001220e477","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1041311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conway Savage","original_name":"Conway Savage","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/fHw5PnqBRVWJv9MaYY4k3KCJNjT.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d9b9e9035a61e0032237a38","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1041312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Sclavunos","original_name":"Jim Sclavunos","popularity":0.062,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d9b9ea115c636002120db3b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1041309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Wydler","original_name":"Thomas Wydler","popularity":0.0723,"profile_path":"/ugRrksRihs7kk6iIwTtR9jvSLmt.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d9b9ea96af8f80020194ea0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1400717,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mick Harvey","original_name":"Mick Harvey","popularity":0.1121,"profile_path":"/cyGIzQmSoYuRhGv0UKXMdkftLBf.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d9b9ed2db952d00124bcc6c","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":592909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fabien Raymond","original_name":"Fabien Raymond","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57a97441925141383f0036ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0400687","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1442,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/blEK2RTAmRa95ERZHiWMknvX4cH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2562}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/t7XpbNCuyzWNaXwTo0SuSfhoxfh.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1476},{"aspect_ratio":0.69,"height":1215,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/x3G5iDKuurYrmBZjku57cdVUOo7.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":838}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2007-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
