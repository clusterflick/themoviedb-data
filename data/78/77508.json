The guests include an uncle who is a Nazi collaborator, a blind war veteran, a simpering physician, an arrogant educator, a patriotic girl, and the husband of the guest of honor. When some German soldiers are killed outside the house, the group is told by the Gestapo that they must choose among themselves two who will be shot if the killer is not caught. If two victims are not chosen, all seven at the party will be captured. Things sound pretty grim, but the black comedy begins when all seven try to save themselves by any means possible.","popularity":0.2835,"poster_path":"/p1WO4EpMhFIBt93t0LM4L47RDEW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1501,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flora Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":11788,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compagnie Industrielle et Commerciale Cinématographique","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":12956,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Borderie","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":10484,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produzione D.S.
