After his discharge, he reports to their boss, Fauji, an ex-army officer, who, at one time was a bank security guard, was unsuccessful in looting it, ended up as a gangster, and now wants to be an MLA. Fauji is then hired by the personal assistant, Rawat, of the Chief Minister, Jaya Gulati, to disrupt the non-violent agitation led by Malik against the government's Land Acquisition legislation - that empowers it to acquire land at very low compensation from farmers and allow it to powerful and influential industrialists like Aggarwal - who has paid her a huge bribe.

They are turned down as the group does not want their demands tarnished by the involvement of ex-convicts/goons.","popularity":0.4742,"poster_path":"/7DrTNMIKAep8Zc0R1wORuQwqyjU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2011-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sahi Dhandhe Galat Bande","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6217,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anupam Kher","original_name":"Anupam Kher","popularity":0.8891,"profile_path":"/f7hWJ4tvzR7uXmYoTiB41TpQ2NZ.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Aggarwal","credit_id":"5a539ded92514113300351d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharat Saxena","original_name":"Sharat Saxena","popularity":0.519,"profile_path":"/ArW6nQ23bjVfbcFmNVl4W9zpd7X.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Fauji","credit_id":"5a539df90e0a260266037f06","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parvin Dabas","original_name":"Parvin Dabas","popularity":0.1629,"profile_path":"/2R6r3wsJ5oGEAJusFn95m8GYSRb.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Rajbir","credit_id":"5a539e080e0a260266037f0f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1447782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tina Desai","original_name":"Tina Desai","popularity":0.5287,"profile_path":"/qgWNQup7v43INpgSe24WlGcSo0G.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Neha Sharma","credit_id":"5a539e31925141132c035d52","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86022,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yashpal Sharma","original_name":"Yashpal Sharma","popularity":0.2768,"profile_path":"/hYDZkMl6u3rM2cASabpHgrvA0mf.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Malik","credit_id":"5a539e660e0a260263037f27","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Parvin Dabas","original_name":"Parvin Dabas","popularity":0.1629,"profile_path":"/2R6r3wsJ5oGEAJusFn95m8GYSRb.jpg","credit_id":"5a539e4dc3a36875530359ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1630282","wikidata_id":"Q7399600","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":2854,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7DrTNMIKAep8Zc0R1wORuQwqyjU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":315446,"name":"bollywood"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"2011-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
