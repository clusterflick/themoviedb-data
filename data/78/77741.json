In this function, they, for instance, represented the militant Horst Mahler in court. One thing that united all three of them was their goal to create a new and different republic. They viewed Federal Germany as an oppressor of political freedom and as a vassal of the United States. Today, Schily is a former Federal Minister of the Interior with a firmly conservative stance and Ströbele is a well-respected member of the left wing of the Green Party in the German parliament while Mahler has again come into conflict with the law because of his extremist right-wing activities.","popularity":0.3163,"poster_path":"/ujOIDsu0MhDUNmzu7C5HnHI18AH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8048,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bildersturm","origin_country":""},{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A German Story","title":"The Lawyers","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Die Anwälte - Eine deutsche Geschichte","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Lawyers - A German Story","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":362376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Horst Mahler","original_name":"Horst Mahler","popularity":0.0795,"profile_path":"/eEYR7ysXRIAgJX9IzZeN9WUkTxs.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe497ac3a368484e12d70b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Schily","original_name":"Otto Schily","popularity":0.1002,"profile_path":"/2QwL0XkrWHw7ewox2aajxSEf77l.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe497ac3a368484e12d70f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":582483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hans-Christian Ströbele","original_name":"Hans-Christian Ströbele","popularity":0.1767,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"52fe497ac3a368484e12d713","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":419834,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Birgit Schulz","original_name":"Birgit Schulz","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe497ac3a368484e12d707","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":419834,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Birgit Schulz","original_name":"Birgit Schulz","popularity":0.0768,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"559d282b92514142140013e4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5372120,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marcus Schmickler","original_name":"Marcus Schmickler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67fd2b73c1e0a708cbad2678","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1439446","wikidata_id":"Q1211058","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hwK6VkwRybQoyTWqfcuMOMgvKKq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1599,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/ujOIDsu0MhDUNmzu7C5HnHI18AH.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1066},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cP1OADppgIgWB4oNA2HIYAF5YXs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1130},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/QZrSwFWQM6GqdFgeLO9Rf8zupC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":74,"name":"germany"},{"id":1698,"name":"ideology"},{"id":10909,"name":"lawyer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
