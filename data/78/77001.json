The show, RAIot (a play on the name of the Italian state public TV: RAI, and the English word riot), lampooned prime minister Berlusconi. Since it wasn't considered a satirical show, but a political one, it was cancelled after the first episode.","popularity":0.1076,"poster_path":"/gwF85ZCog7LR2Vzu0tPigTxseHr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":779,"logo_path":"/KFFOFoztyjV5epvnW5GerPbcvx.png","name":"Lucky Red","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Viva Zapatero!","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":19,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1294923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Alberoni","original_name":"Francesco Alberoni","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/qZii535H16xx4oFbr5q5yadsXLJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a53d2f90e0a26026903c206","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1788319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lucia Annunziata","original_name":"Lucia Annunziata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a53d30b0e0a26026303ca73","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1956366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enzo Biagi","original_name":"Enzo Biagi","popularity":0.0623,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5a53d31ac3a3687553039e6a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":90141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Silvio Berlusconi","original_name":"Silvio Berlusconi","popularity":0.1922,"profile_path":"/wmWqH1gMFQwLFSSbTCO5iryVsQx.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5a53d323925141132603708f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1715423,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michele Santoro","original_name":"Michele Santoro","popularity":0.0704,"profile_path":"/pNLqA91IHfmRr1Ldv49hOy6HvVM.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"665a633b10a4adc4cc590385","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabina Guzzanti","original_name":"Sabina Guzzanti","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/99wjbIZyZtIrRQccUrgt4wjd9Jx.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4956c3a368484e126735","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sabina Guzzanti","original_name":"Sabina Guzzanti","popularity":0.0778,"profile_path":"/99wjbIZyZtIrRQccUrgt4wjd9Jx.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4956c3a368484e12673b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0482633","wikidata_id":"Q521117","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ybaLDg7Egi9vYmriIfJ1qqE3BBL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1039,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/gwF85ZCog7LR2Vzu0tPigTxseHr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":693},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1284,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/9EGS3hZpe8gghLpMudelvvFSCtG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":856},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/hSA2N5dT4ll1FaCFTOmlPvE262m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
