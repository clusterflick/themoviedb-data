In the first half, directed by Marvin Chomsky, Cade finds himself targeted for assassination when he's scheduled to testify in the trial of a mob kingpin -- what he doesn't know is that the assassin is one of his oldest friends (Darren McGavin), who is romancing another old friend (Loretta Swit) with a troubled past and using Cade's determination and his investigative skills to set him up for a hit. In the second half, directed by Richard Donner, Cade gets a tip that the mob has planned an assassination on a retired crime boss (Edward Asner) living in the county, who is so bull-headed and distrustful of the law that he won't accept any help or provide any information on who the killers might be, even though he's putting his own daughter (Shelley Fabares) at risk.","popularity":1.2441,"poster_path":"/qqiZTGrWejh2VjBbbh24kqBmmOZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sam Cade","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Sam Cade Marshall of Madrid","type":"full title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3381,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Ford","original_name":"Glenn Ford","popularity":0.7917,"profile_path":"/5HGIsOVaVwlc4brv7IdVJ7ncEZ5.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Sam Cade","credit_id":"59ac6878c3a3682c9c03212c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30512,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edgar Buchanan","original_name":"Edgar Buchanan","popularity":0.5683,"profile_path":"/zKcqHZrqVsS0N4kdnqaD8vdOINI.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"J.J.
