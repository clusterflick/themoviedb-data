Fishermen, farmers, local magistrates. But their dedication to a prophetic Jewish preacher in the backwaters of the Roman Empire transformed them into revolutionaries and, in the process, changed the world itself in ways that would reverberate across time for two thousand years. Now, discover the extraordinary, untold stories of the men chosen by Jesus to bring God’s plan to the world. Among them: Peter, the rock upon which Christ would build His new religion; James and John, the fiery-tempered “sons of thunder”; Matthew, the tax collector later murdered by cannibals; Simon the Zealot, the anti-Roman fanatic eventually “cut to pieces” preaching in Spain; and Judas Iscariot, whose betrayal would be paid for with silver and suicide.","popularity":1.0691,"poster_path":"/8ykAFsxhhqMaZQSUgtljW5JcoBi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56484,"logo_path":null,"name":"Weller/Grossman Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":5223,"logo_path":"/l3uVOjvnSXZ81mEdR06PkIwxGTC.png","name":"Paulist Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"},{"id":18441,"logo_path":"/rJmXT9sgCKG8uSUO1T93kOTfAzm.png","name":"A+E Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Twelve Apostles","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Twelve Apostles","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Story of the Twelve Apostles","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martin Sheen","original_name":"Martin Sheen","popularity":1.2177,"profile_path":"/m2Y3Q0uyuW6htrn2W9UWCWMkpZu.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"579e596f925141106e0026a1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4536975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth C.
