One day she starts receiving phone calls from people thinking that she is the popular singer Tianyou. It turns out that someone has leaked 600 phone numbers of famous people to the internet and Yishu's phone number got mixed up in the bunch. She finds it annoying at first but soon she receives a text message from Xiaowen, who is the singer in an amateur rock band. He wishes to write a song for Tianyou and wants Yishu -who he thinks is Tianyou's assistant- to deliver the song to Tianyou. Tianyou is a popular singer, but hasn't had a hit number lately.
