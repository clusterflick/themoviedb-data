From that thematic springboard, Dammbeck branches out omnidirectionally, segueing into a series of thematic riffs and variants on such marginally-related subjects as: the history of cyberspace, terrorism, utopian ideals, LSD, the Central Intelligence Agency, and Cuckoo's Nest author Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters.","popularity":0.4902,"poster_path":"/Att9uSj2B5Kw57Bfda1qHj4uZIK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":80454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lutz Dammbeck Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2003-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Net","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":12,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Net: The Unabomber, LSD and the Internet","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Das Netz - Unabomber, LSD und Internet","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eva Mattes","original_name":"Eva Mattes","popularity":0.407,"profile_path":"/63ET2xZ3ezbDGKwXxz2eqwX0pxB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"57b417f5c3a36819b50039e0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1667182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Vogt","original_name":"Tom Vogt","popularity":0.0772,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"57b418029251412f3300172c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188384,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lutz Dammbeck","original_name":"Lutz Dammbeck","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":"/5UdOZu0lN71EToiuYxkhAx5paki.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57b417ea92514148cd0032f0","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stewart Brand","original_name":"Stewart Brand","popularity":0.0823,"profile_path":"/2S3WjssRiEWP48wRWi6LhkMFrfz.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57b4182bc3a368184a002008","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":39543,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Brockman","original_name":"John Brockman","popularity":0.0461,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57b41832c3a36819b5003a06","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":39546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Butch Gehring","original_name":"Butch Gehring","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"57b41839c3a3684dd10016ba","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":39548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Gelernter","original_name":"David Gelernter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"57b418409251412f61001638","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1667184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert W.
