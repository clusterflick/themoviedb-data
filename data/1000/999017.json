As Susan, The Doctor’s granddaughter, she left Gallifrey with the errant Time Lord before the very first episode, An Unearthly Child.  This Myth Makers combines two interviews by Nicholas Briggs, the first at Carole’s home in 1985 and the second at a London TV studio in 1996.  Together they give a very personal view of the early days of Doctor Who and the effects the programme had on Carole’s life and career.","popularity":0.0866,"poster_path":"/sewov4QuqW7T9jpFuUV3eqIJ0Rj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":"/o5qBQfB646D9Ooyqo8OHpllmXWr.png","name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Myth Makers 4: Carole Ann Ford","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1193572,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicholas Briggs","original_name":"Nicholas Briggs","popularity":0.1569,"profile_path":"/7QUxZVfw8WqUSxPVHrhmRtXGFUl.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"62ccfadfe8d0280052f205c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1193573,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carole Ann Ford","original_name":"Carole Ann Ford","popularity":0.1697,"profile_path":"/2rpy4eydA8pT4e8uUXSPpgxCVOc.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62ccfae5a9117f0bb2e76940","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187330,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Keith Barnfather","original_name":"Keith Barnfather","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":"/nc5XBOgyj8cy4R6t4d9Ilf3Rl6h.jpg","credit_id":"62ccfb02f48e0d004e6935da","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":812,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sewov4QuqW7T9jpFuUV3eqIJ0Rj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":547}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1985-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5},{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Extended Edition","release_date":"1996-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
