He is taking Valentina, his lover, back to her native village to bury her. When Valentina left this village years ago, before becoming a transgender singer in a faraway city, people here knew her as Pol. Valentina's past and death remain an enigma. Yet bit by bit, through his encounters with the people of the village, Saor begins to perceive what connected them to Pol. Sensitive to the world around him, Saor, like a Shaman, enters their memories. Saor starts to understand that, like all homosexuals persecuted by Shining Path terrorists, Pol lived in terror. In the village cemetery, between rage and bitterness, Saor attends the burial of Valentina's body. A ceremony that is both a burial and an exhumation.","popularity":0.3262,"poster_path":"/9YAuC9iEMAHFIvxFLzPHEpRwmz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32223,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clin d'oeil Films","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":17469,"logo_path":"/miAQau5aAXbJ82rriLgst7jtiNb.png","name":"Tu Vas Voir","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":178694,"logo_path":null,"name":"Perpetua Cine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fugue","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2501594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Saor Sax","original_name":"Saor Sax","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Saor","credit_id":"66aea938f00fe9e30c0b6a32","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4865345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentina Linares Gonzalez","original_name":"Valentina Linares Gonzalez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Valentina","credit_id":"66aea944ca4548c3b0b2ca87","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bénédicte Liénard","original_name":"Bénédicte Liénard","popularity":0.1201,"profile_path":"/2beeJIdh7iYPa0adjm0rvANApvH.jpg","credit_id":"62cdbc67481382004f99270e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1446304,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bénédicte Liénard","original_name":"Bénédicte Liénard","popularity":0.1201,"profile_path":"/2beeJIdh7iYPa0adjm0rvANApvH.jpg","credit_id":"62cdbc744b9bae1a3b724235","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3387734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Jimenez Freeman-Morris","original_name":"Mary Jimenez Freeman-Morris","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":"/wdywmdpXSEFjMqEyE9yngiy62OA.jpg","credit_id":"62cdbc8295665826165f63c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3387734,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mary Jimenez Freeman-Morris","original_name":"Mary Jimenez Freeman-Morris","popularity":0.0807,"profile_path":"/wdywmdpXSEFjMqEyE9yngiy62OA.jpg","credit_id":"62cdbc8a4c1bb0004df257d3","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2266759,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Thomas Bouffioulx","original_name":"Thomas Bouffioulx","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aea97bb086e9ff6a650e41","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287970,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Loco González","original_name":"Loco González","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aea98f22086264daa34873","department":"Lighting","job":"Gaffer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1651887,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Pilar Peredo","original_name":"Pilar Peredo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aea99df0426dec9200f08e","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1487487,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Virginie Surdej","original_name":"Virginie Surdej","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":"/wTjbxuueMLuRZ0TXGjnvbkJIl5R.jpg","credit_id":"66aea9ae2f6c80891c2e350b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2219430,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Hanne Phlypo","original_name":"Hanne Phlypo","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66aea9bc2cad424d8200f0f2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23867366","wikidata_id":"Q131567035","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1UV35aXfLAJKN8ea9UaCkda7FBK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/9YAuC9iEMAHFIvxFLzPHEpRwmz.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/op2BM0w26SoyfWDlP9PyWw7z6kN.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Edinburgh International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
