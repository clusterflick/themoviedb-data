The expression \"Vel d'Hiv round-up\" has become part of our collective memory, to the point of becoming the main memorial reference point for France during the dark years. Based on research carried out in unpublished or rarely explored archives, this film retraces the history of this roundup as experienced by hunted Jews and police trackers, from its planning in the Vichy offices to its hour-by-hour unfolding in the streets of Paris.","popularity":0.0667,"poster_path":"/45LqPfmeKsvluksEUN3BGZBycPL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48098,"logo_path":"/fWIaTm5r2j6WHgatBFLn1ioZxSB.png","name":"Roche Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Rafle du Vel d'Hiv, la honte et les larmes","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":308811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Korn-Brzoza","original_name":"David Korn-Brzoza","popularity":0.1585,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cdcd5fe8131d1dca450a70","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21354830","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4l8JX4nwACUuY19JWwozSzrOQFm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hHLwrGZwZWfk6CSaG2tMHzqWwK0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/45LqPfmeKsvluksEUN3BGZBycPL.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kVxmQBKKiRDIwz54hvpnUqtlBOS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"France 3","release_date":"2022-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
