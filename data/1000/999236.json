This satirical, absurdist take on today’s world will have you laughing and terrified in equal measure, and ultimately the very idea of justice is put on trial, with all of us in the dock.  In collaboration with Richard Bean (One Man, Two Guvnors), Proper Job Theatre Company have created a new film inspired by Kafka’s novel.  Following on from their sell out theatre tour last Autumn, Proper Job have now taken this production and the short preview film created during lockdown, to bring you their first film – The Trial.  This well-crafted, high quality company use their visual and dynamic style to explore how our world of surveillance and digital dependency could play out. Sharp, funny and just the right amount of mad.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trial","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
