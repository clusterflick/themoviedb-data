From the spring of 1941, whether they had been French for several generations or naturalized for a few years, foreigners who had taken refuge in France or stateless people who had been driven out of their country, they were put on file, arrested or threatened at any time. Some wrote to the administration, or directly to Marshal Pétain, who seemed to them to be the last resort. These requests are called Suppliques. Men, women, sometimes children, tried as best they could, by all means, to loosen the trap. They address themselves to their executioners, but they do not know it.","popularity":0.2968,"poster_path":"/dKsIyxadI5dAIr4izsctvtol9GT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6293,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Générale de Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Suppliques","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1168412,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jérôme Prieur","original_name":"Jérôme Prieur","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62cdcbbbfd4a960f4e8412c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21354810","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ztechAE36v0yWRz6KzhBu3YluWt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/63kNaDGj9fQSujbhECgPMvh5H6j.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/dKsIyxadI5dAIr4izsctvtol9GT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/1y3KksvXHtMQ0metvRAuwILR2Fh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":154866,"name":"archive footage"},{"id":221078,"name":"old footage"},{"id":279473,"name":"jews"},{"id":294205,"name":"war documentary"},{"id":295575,"name":"war story"},{"id":321490,"name":"historical documentary"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
