By day, she mends clothes for clients and works as a janitor at the local music school to cover all of her family’s expenses. With few options for her generation since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the closure of factories, Marina nurtures education and musical skills in her children, hoping that they will have a different future from her own.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweeping Yerevan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3622155,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nairi Hakhverdi","original_name":"Nairi Hakhverdi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ce4d4ad75bd601f79b38a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19888840","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
