It's created as a parody of a horror movie where plastic plays the role of evil. The character of sexy and blonde doll Garbie (Garbage+Barbie) lost her way in the haunted forest. Plastic bags emerge from the darkness like ghosts; toothbrushes, straws and bottles grow instead of trees, and a variety of other horror cliches are waiting for her ahead.","popularity":0.1214,"poster_path":"/1wKoI1IRuoN9nBj3YDiByrzhFMX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2020-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wrapped in Plastic","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Garbie's Adventures","type":"english working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3624159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volodymyr Yudashkin","original_name":"Volodymyr Yudashkin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d08ef2699fb700c4f07851","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2368072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anastasiia Falileieva","original_name":"Анастасія Фалілеєва","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/ezEYKGOWTAdaSuVQsve7pGoJVlU.jpg","credit_id":"62d08f47549dda004fd1fd54","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3624159,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Volodymyr Yudashkin","original_name":"Volodymyr Yudashkin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d08eff35811d005928f953","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21285988","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1wKoI1IRuoN9nBj3YDiByrzhFMX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Linoleum International Contemporary Animation and Media Art Festival (informal date)","release_date":"2020-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Wrapped in Plastic / Garbie’s Adventures / Trailer","key":"GyKPDsk82-o","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-11-22T09:48:57.000Z","id":"62d08e6983ee670055d07474"}]}}}
