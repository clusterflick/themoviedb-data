One of the most recognized psychiatrists of the city, Mr. Romero, is experimenting new hypnosis techniques as a healing tool with his patients, finding out that hypnosis has never been tested in a dying human being. Romero wonders if this technique could stop or delay death in dying patients. Valdemar, a Brazilian diplomatic who suffers tuberculosis, is willing to collaborate with Romero and agrees to be hypnotized the night he is supposed to die. The experiment will have dramatic consequences, Romero will be accused of Satanism and sentenced to death by the Ecuadorian president. His only chance of survival, is to persuade the presidents' secretary that he is innocent. He has only one chance to tell the truth.","popularity":0.3435,"poster_path":"/vzEavYnjmSUeoyE77YTlbusMo1i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EC","name":"Ecuador"}],"release_date":"2009-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La verdad sobre el caso del señor Valdemar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3622054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pedro Pérez","original_name":"Pedro Pérez","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Dr. Romero","credit_id":"62ce2a40b97442006b07d74b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manuel Calisto Sánchez","original_name":"Manuel Calisto Sánchez","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Secretary","credit_id":"62ce2a52d5191f0053f7ace1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3622055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Octavio de Barros","original_name":"Octavio de Barros","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Valdemar","credit_id":"62ce2a65e62719004f66eeb9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1624719,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Cisneros","original_name":"Alex Cisneros","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"62ce2a7f6f6a99018efeff3b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1572336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pablo Aguirre Andrade","original_name":"Pablo Aguirre Andrade","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/r1HNk5zhnrZlwp8MMlgaPMpNzWj.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"","credit_id":"62ce2a91d4cc8e004b4fa0c1","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2967738,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Andrés Vera","original_name":"Carlos Andrés Vera","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/krvvC5os28UUjnFo6svuEMPzsrr.jpg","credit_id":"62ce293cd4cc8e004e27b9ba","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2967738,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Andrés Vera","original_name":"Carlos Andrés Vera","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/krvvC5os28UUjnFo6svuEMPzsrr.jpg","credit_id":"62ce29466331b200f25fd9fa","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2847375,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jimena Villaroel","original_name":"Jimena Villaroel","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ce296cb97442005378968b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2967748,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Francisco X.
