By combining clips grabbed from different car commercials as well as adding my own compositions, I created an absurd fantasy with ambiguous narration as our self-reflection, to examine meanings conveyed by the media. The background music is grabbed from a car commercial which uses the song, The Impossible Dream, originally composed by Mitch Leigh & Joe Darion.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/2PwXdLVHcxqXmrjGGeqKZrhDDZd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Impossible Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3332574,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hailing Liu","original_name":"Hailing Liu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62ce0ab41d820f004fa77267","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2PwXdLVHcxqXmrjGGeqKZrhDDZd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2019-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
