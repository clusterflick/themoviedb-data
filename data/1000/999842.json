Emperor Ofussy's kingdom is being attacked by long-time enemy Emperor Zakachie. Only one thing can kill him: a secret stone called the \"malaise\" that's hidden somewhere in the infamous Féliks' caves, a very dangerous place where you can get deathly comshotted at. Entering the Féliks' caves is a death wish. Now, Ofu's last hope is General Corabi, who apparently once went into Féliks' and survived. Will Ofussy trust Corabi? Will Zachachie be malaised?","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":"/6PVuZy6e9LEkSUPFYqHNP2O3BuG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178766,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Djamesse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Oki but he isn't malaise... yet","title":"Ofussy Wars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"La Guerre Ofussy","type":"french title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3623862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Claude Pommier","original_name":"Marie-Claude Pommier","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Queen of France","credit_id":"62d055e2dff66e006c7e1b9f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3623863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabelle Titevierge","original_name":"Isabelle Titevierge","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Zakachie's mother","credit_id":"62d055fa2d8ef300c2e39227","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3623865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelyane Faon","original_name":"Kelyane Faon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"General Bugzy","credit_id":"62d056170ce1bc08107f5e9f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3623866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Genevieve Dangers","original_name":"Genevieve Dangers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"General Corabi","credit_id":"62d0563041a561004ff79e90","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3623867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Makiakio","original_name":"Tom Makiakio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Féliks, creature from the Féliks' Caves","credit_id":"62d0564f41a56100546dd8d2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3623868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Choze","original_name":"Evan Choze","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Emperor Zakachie","credit_id":"62d056683af929004fb89f6a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3623869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zaine Mâlique","original_name":"Zaine Mâlique","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Emperor Ofussy","credit_id":"62d057210b5fd6004eee088a","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3623870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marie-Roche Morin","original_name":"Marie-Roche Morin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Harison Stylé","credit_id":"62d0576d41a561004cac0add","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3623871,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kamya","original_name":"Kamya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d057d65690b50050268a4b","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3623872,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Simon French","original_name":"Simon French","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d057f52385130055922857","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3623873,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Djamesse","original_name":"Djamesse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62d0580bd5ffcb004c126755","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":944,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6PVuZy6e9LEkSUPFYqHNP2O3BuG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":644}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"18A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Ofussy Wars (2023 Movie) | Official Trailer HD","key":"No72TnbRPWc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-07-15T05:16:17.000Z","id":"62d0f87b6c0b36004ffc1c63"}]}}}
