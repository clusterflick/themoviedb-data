In Little Miss Roughneck, Fellows is cast as Foxine LaRue, a tomboyish sort who is being prodded into a show-biz career by her stage mother Gert (Margaret Irving). Young Mr. Partridge (Scott Colton) becomes Foxine's agent, principally because he's sweet on the girl's older sister Mary (Jacqueline Wells). Blackballed from Hollywood because of her mother's pushiness, Foxine tries to help out Partridge and her own family by cooking up a bizarre publicity stunt, enlisting the aid of easy-going Mexican \"papacita\" Pascual (Leo Carrillo).","popularity":0.6844,"poster_path":"/wuwYTEqSyYzG46AvrJEp4BtXPk2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1938-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She's a panic in pigtails!","title":"Little Miss Roughneck","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":174992,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edith Fellows","original_name":"Edith Fellows","popularity":0.2192,"profile_path":"/A1aJD5G8g6fH8zAM0MQsb7lSvGQ.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Foxine LaRue","credit_id":"573dcec4c3a3680190000e3f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78850,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Carrillo","original_name":"Leo Carrillo","popularity":0.1883,"profile_path":"/2vnSRTNNUcaay4PcnOTCqDCwjqf.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Pascual Orozco","credit_id":"573dced19251414bd800125d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2012,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scott Kolk","original_name":"Scott Kolk","popularity":0.1813,"profile_path":"/jigS2Fy2u211scDtWzBBWbELBI0.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Al Patridge (as Scott Colton)","credit_id":"573dcede92514136720024f6","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julie Bishop","original_name":"Julie Bishop","popularity":0.1635,"profile_path":"/e0PQwkBiHBcjaLaoYIZry7bn3xA.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Mary LaRue (as Jacqueline Wells)","credit_id":"573dceed9251413e1c0004e7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99458,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Irving","original_name":"Margaret Irving","popularity":0.1573,"profile_path":"/fnIRju3vQQrijTG65WBFVAf6xPG.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Mrs. Gertrude 'Gert' LaRue","credit_id":"573dcefa9251413e1c0004e9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13360,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inez Palange","original_name":"Inez Palange","popularity":0.1889,"profile_path":"/sexmMMSUkytcjB4IuH18dvlWV1Y.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Mercedes Orozco","credit_id":"5fcb109b8261ee003f404a9a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George McKay","original_name":"George McKay","popularity":0.1752,"profile_path":"/12IVyIGZHaKbkXEujho9kL9lyqZ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Phil Edwards","credit_id":"5fcb10abe1ad79003ef80ec1","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1279018,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank C.
