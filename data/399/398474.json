These paintings depict Thelapaththa Jathakaya, a moral story where Lord Buddha said that a man with a big target in life must not be swayed by passion (Keles), the five senses and especially beautiful women. One day, Ananda picks up a hair pin belonging to a young woman. While attempting to return this object to its owner, his repressed feelings are awoken by the beauty and sensuality of the woman. The young monk's inner spiritual world is plunged into turmoil. Then one day the paintings are destroyed. While restoring them for the second time Ananda begins to realize that he is trapped in a web of his worldly desires and attachments.","popularity":0.3035,"poster_path":"/nNxxPMBsrMqUNtsQ7QspIDf9uNb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Sinhalese","iso_639_1":"si","name":"සිංහල"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sankara","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1977325,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thumindu Dodantenna","original_name":"Thumindu Dodantenna","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":"/rPMfDli6XzCkPrdn548dSzJqMUm.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"The Monk","credit_id":"6088e07be19de90029f7638c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1938479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sachini Ayendra","original_name":"Sachini Ayendra","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/uixcq1fAm7Ms9kxeXDOyckUAbBg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hairpin Woman","credit_id":"6088dede66e4690058feeaa9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3070269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nilua Heenkendaarachchi","original_name":"Nilua Heenkendaarachchi","popularity":0.0414,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Monk's Secular Alter Ego","credit_id":"6088dee8e19de90029f76109","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3070270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"K.A.
