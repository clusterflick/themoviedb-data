While men talk politics and sports, women talk about their condition. A teenager observes the gap between the sexes.  Co-directed by two actresses, Paule Baillargeon and Frederique Collin, The Red Kitchen is the birth of the Quebec women's cinema. The birth of the film was difficult, and funding has been largely achieved through donations from friends and a benefit concert. This war of the sexes takes place in a demanding formal research, based on the improvisation of the actors, whose preparation took place over long sessions in the workshop. The end result mixes black humour, horror and a very expressive fantasy that gave rise to heated debates.","popularity":0.3516,"poster_path":"/ezfEbhUQMA87hOsXP3PfM098aFa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77189,"logo_path":null,"name":"Institut québécois du
