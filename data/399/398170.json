Once again he manages to make something that is normal very strange: the dancing people in costumes are filmed in such a way that they look bizarre and absurd. Jan de Bont's camerawork shows a series of color images of dancing people, edited to the rhythm of the music. Halfway through the film, a lonely clown can be seen among the dancing crowd, accompanied by sad music. This clown is played by Ditvoorst himself.","popularity":0.178,"poster_path":"/ranURcS8qA0et3PmYDD3lPguR2m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1969-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carna","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2209,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jan de Bont","original_name":"Jan de Bont","popularity":0.5957,"profile_path":"/evj9vN5pxxjr4aFLZRvniU0gzof.jpg","credit_id":"61326293cede690087042f1d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2794951,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pjotr van Dijk","original_name":"Pjotr van Dijk","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6132629915a4a100633f6b55","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10815,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Theo van de Sande","original_name":"Theo van de Sande","popularity":0.1084,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6132629f5ab81a0068bfb377","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1359001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adriaan Ditvoorst","original_name":"Adriaan Ditvoorst","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/j8yquvBsxJdk3s2Tcb3JxSuMAeH.jpg","credit_id":"573d55a19251413675001476","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1359001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adriaan Ditvoorst","original_name":"Adriaan Ditvoorst","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/j8yquvBsxJdk3s2Tcb3JxSuMAeH.jpg","credit_id":"5f71c2ffc92c5d0039464e5a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1359001,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adriaan Ditvoorst","original_name":"Adriaan Ditvoorst","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/j8yquvBsxJdk3s2Tcb3JxSuMAeH.jpg","credit_id":"5f71c328e4b5760038e89b08","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2794952,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Ine de Rooij","original_name":"Ine de Rooij","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f71c364435abd00370497af","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1403787,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hans Oosterhuis","original_name":"Hans Oosterhuis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f71c374fbe36f00365a7fb3","department":"Art","job":"Production Design"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1330986","wikidata_id":"Q2495347","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1021,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wWy68pBmA5dOMyuiMKOrtBLFpRA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1815}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1560,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ranURcS8qA0et3PmYDD3lPguR2m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1040}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":3473,"name":"carnival"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"1969-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
