These are America's unseen. Dogtown Redemption tells the story of one river, and the humanity of its inhabitants in Dogtown, West Oakland, a lively, bustling yet invisible corner of California. We follow the lives of three recyclers: Jason Witt, the titan of recycling, Landon Goodwin, a former minister, and crack addict who struggles with his own fall from grace, and Miss Hayok Kay, the ultimate outsider, formerly a punk rocker from a prominent Korean family, now at the mercy of the elements and predators. Through them, we are introduced to the art, science, economics and politics of recycling: what it offers, how it touches the poor and why it matters to all of us.","popularity":0.072,"poster_path":"/wtRp2F9d2X8SQvzutgX6qnmaDI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"...the street's gonna pay me.\"","title":"Dogtown Redemption","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1622217,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Amir Soltani","original_name":"Amir Soltani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573d6daac3a3680190000066","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1533173,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Chihiro Wimbush","original_name":"Chihiro Wimbush","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573d6db59251413678001812","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3246410","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zPwbb9JugU7dB4xkg3UrVNZT8RD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wtRp2F9d2X8SQvzutgX6qnmaDI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Independent Lens","release_date":"2016-05-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
