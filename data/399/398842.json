Although it's considered to be a visual satire on rural American Life, perhaps the story goes deeper than canvas. In this provocative horror tale by accliamed photographer, Carlos Batts, we see a different interpretation of a rural American Family on the 75th Anniversary of Wood's painting, American Gothic. Batts paints his own story and invites us into a world where the old farmer struggles with his crime of passion, the consequences and his iconic fate. A pcture may be worth a 1,000 words, but this painting's story will leave you speechless.","popularity":0.0935,"poster_path":"/kQ6HH06IMlTAyhujKwi6GUVfpIC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32728,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cult
