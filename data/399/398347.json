The farmers continue to work the land and the boats sail on. As William Carlos Williams later wrote in his poem of the same name, \"a once mighty god becomes a little splash quite unnoticed.\" In Chris Sullivan's version, Icarus becomes Ray, an aging priest whose congregation is dwindling as fast as his sanity. As Ray's condition deteriorates, society fails to notice or care.","popularity":0.1293,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Landscape with the Fall of Icarus","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1091347,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Sullivan","original_name":"Chris Sullivan","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573ea48b92514108d30011aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0130071","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":10093,"name":"priest"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-04-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
