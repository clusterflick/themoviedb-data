Its characters include pimps, transsexuals, girls/women, boys, and johns. Shot in Montreal in the course of a year, the individual stories of these people cut across each other, and many come together in the film’s conclusion. Their lives―sometimes tragic, sometimes hilarious, but often disarming and touching, are presented in a direct, occasionally brutal way. Although there are no explicit scenes in the film, it was given an adult rating.  This inside view of a singular world makes us reflect on life, love, relationships, and sexuality.","popularity":0.169,"poster_path":"/An1EE4lvD4a376dhBm8pOYKW9oV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77184,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Crépuscule","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1980-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some Even Fall in Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624136,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jean-Pierre Bruneau","original_name":"Jean-Pierre Bruneau","popularity":0.0585,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5741aac392514173b9002754","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624135,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guy Simoneau","original_name":"Guy Simoneau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5741aab192514139590005fd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624138,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Richard Saint-Pierre","original_name":"Richard Saint-Pierre","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5741aad9c3a3680745004e65","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624135,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guy Simoneau","original_name":"Guy Simoneau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5741aa9ec3a3687b33000675","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624137,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Martial Filion","original_name":"Martial Filion","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5741aacec3a3680745004e5e","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1624135,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Guy Simoneau","original_name":"Guy Simoneau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5741aa90c3a36807270052f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0152010","wikidata_id":"Q48671278","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/An1EE4lvD4a376dhBm8pOYKW9oV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":13059,"name":"prostitution"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"1980-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
