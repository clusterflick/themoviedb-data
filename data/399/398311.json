She communicates through looking, gesture and the body language of her movement and interactions. Justine observes the rhythms of her day, giving a unique portrait of the experience of a vivacious young woman living with severe neurological disorders. Justine survived a harrowing breakdown as a child but her medical condition is not the subject of this film, which instead gives a sense of her extraordinary life and experience in the rhythms of an ordinary day as she turns 18. Justine's parents tenderly build close family bonds to sustain their youngest daughter. They speak perceptively and movingly about their daughter and sister. Meanwhile, cuts to the UK welfare system endanger the family's hard won achievements, and raise questions and fears for her future.","popularity":0.0493,"poster_path":"/4Ap8zZhwWO8JhFJrc0ZHEvtMwBs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Justine","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1622674,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pratap Rughani","original_name":"Pratap Rughani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"573e727992514127cc000538","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3499838","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4Ap8zZhwWO8JhFJrc0ZHEvtMwBs.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
