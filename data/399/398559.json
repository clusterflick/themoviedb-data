As he lay recovering from this standard procedure, the nurse who was meant to watch over him fell asleep reading a bible. Thus neglected, Andy Warhol died and entered the land of legend. 25 years later film-maker Jim Sharman, writer Stephen Sewell and composer Basil Hogios interweave verse, song and imagery into a unique and dreamlike 40 minute exploration of this great artist's life, death and legacy. With Andy Warhol every yes contained a no and every beginning an end. Welcome to the mysterious and wonderful world of ANDY X.","popularity":0.3429,"poster_path":"/4CjtTj4gV1ILpVRd9JlLtyANxPZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120258,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunday Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2012-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Andy X","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1205492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Akos Armont","original_name":"Akos Armont","popularity":0.1045,"profile_path":"/e74ryw3Jvqt3NX024mbfJeRSwdo.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Street Poet / Andy Warhol","credit_id":"5d1c3819a135330010053571","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sheridan Harbridge","original_name":"Sheridan Harbridge","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Nurse / Factory Star / Valerie Solanas / Judy Garland / Scientist","credit_id":"5d1c3847a13533001005360c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1240070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Simpson-Deeks","original_name":"Nick Simpson-Deeks","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":"/oUcUxHGlBC4hhAOxOt9fJ7D0c8H.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Billy Name / Scientist","credit_id":"5d1c3871a1353300120531e5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":75540,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gillian Jones","original_name":"Gillian Jones","popularity":0.2879,"profile_path":"/r2LmNfpxamsEqQJEVyjVay2zlJe.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Julia Warhola / Scientist","credit_id":"5d1c389855b0c00b7a6a574b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1404367,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Denis","original_name":"David Denis","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Jean-Michel Basquiat / Archivist","credit_id":"5d1c38c4a135330011053aa4","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Sharman","original_name":"Jim Sharman","popularity":0.118,"profile_path":"/Av2m8wJkKOZnlpedE4YXteTXjLE.jpg","credit_id":"574057abc3a3680745001aea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13484,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Sharman","original_name":"Jim Sharman","popularity":0.118,"profile_path":"/Av2m8wJkKOZnlpedE4YXteTXjLE.jpg","credit_id":"5d1c375f94d8a851623c1ac5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75724,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stephen Sewell","original_name":"Stephen Sewell","popularity":0.1032,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1c377f55b0c05c826bcc75","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1874393,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Basil Hogios","original_name":"Basil Hogios","popularity":0.0528,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1c37b494d8a855393c1ed1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2353095,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Emma Kingsbury","original_name":"Emma Kingsbury","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d1c38f7a135330011053b3d","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costume Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1111473,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bonnie Elliott","original_name":"Bonnie Elliott","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e42b5050c2710001581a3a7","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2231091","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4CjtTj4gV1ILpVRd9JlLtyANxPZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
