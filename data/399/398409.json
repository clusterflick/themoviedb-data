Alongside marine biologist Holly Lohuis, he invites viewers to dive into this whole new world that will leave them in awe of the beauty and diversity of the oceans – the source of all life on our planet – and inspire an even stronger desire to protect what they have either seen for the first time or perhaps re-discovered along the journey.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":140649,"logo_path":null,"name":"K2 Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jean-Michel Cousteau’s Secret Ocean","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Jean-Michel Cousteau's Secret Ocean 3D","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-03-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
