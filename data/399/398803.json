Charting the heritage and historical importance of these revered temples of learning - from their Scottish beginnings during the mid-18th century right up to present day - against a series of candid interviews with British luminaries such as Stephen Fry, Irvine Welsh, Bonnie Wright, John Cooper Clarke, Robert Montgomery and William Seighart, the documentary makes a passionate plea to save Britain's libraries from the reality of today's political and economic climate.","popularity":0.05,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Safe House: A Decline of Ideas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
