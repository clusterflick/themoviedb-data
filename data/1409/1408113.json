For veteran negotiator Buzz Hargrove, president of the union, the de Havilland/Bombardier talks turn out to be the toughest of his career. Hargrove finds himself doing battle not only with the company, but with his own union locals. Everything goes wrong. Hargrove has to choose between solidarity with his workers or saving thousands of jobs. His decision, the battle that led up to it, and the outcome make for high drama in this no-holds-barred portrait of organized labour in the 1990s. Played on the shifting ground of a globalized economy, \"The Negotiator\" is a revealing look at democracy, leadership and its price in a high stakes fight for jobs and power.","popularity":0.2692,"poster_path":"/AvgymS2ln8eq9O0ZNMjzOO3FTRV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5054,"logo_path":null,"name":"Barna-Alper Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1995-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Negotiator","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Der Unterh√§ndler","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5142854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buzz Hargrove","original_name":"Buzz Hargrove","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"676e0dd4cfe62644df12ab74","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1414450,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Barry Greenwald","original_name":"Barry Greenwald","popularity":0.119,"profile_path":"/kysgifljM4HEC1amHxRuokgYKyY.jpg","credit_id":"676e0cf8f9454eeb1d9294b8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2389654,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Barbara Sears","original_name":"Barbara Sears","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/i17e4Fns0cFl3tEs8di6uCN76rA.jpg","credit_id":"676e0d0ef9bc02e498929895","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106493,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Laszlo Barna","original_name":"Laszlo Barna","popularity":0.0982,"profile_path":"/elJ6xN9qgUuTetkJGw4pf9GVwYD.jpg","credit_id":"676e0d28f9454eeb1d9294bd","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2498095,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alfonso Peccia","original_name":"Alfonso Peccia","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e0d3faa8f3159d612aba8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3458731,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"James Aquila","original_name":"James Aquila","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e0d562c9097b266614f71","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1561502,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Walter Corbett","original_name":"Walter Corbett","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e0d672c9097b266614f75","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0437354","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2451,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/AvgymS2ln8eq9O0ZNMjzOO3FTRV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1634}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Hot Docs International Documentary Festival","release_date":"1996-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Leipzig DOK Festival","release_date":"1995-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
