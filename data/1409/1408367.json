At once alone and part of a shifting circle of acquaintances and employers, Zakhir navigates urban precarity with a kind of enigmatic pragmatism, refusing steady employment for the freedom from obligation and reinventing his dreams when they fail to materialize. Good Guy Bad Guy is a story of street life and celluloid fantasy, family and violence, tenderness and inconstancy.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/qXTmN4XHaaxjZOctyt4C6c3xdH3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Guy, Bad Guy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2491176,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Indu Krishnan","original_name":"Indu Krishnan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676ed987f9bc02e49892a614","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qXTmN4XHaaxjZOctyt4C6c3xdH3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
