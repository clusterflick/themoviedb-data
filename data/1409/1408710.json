Along the way, a mysterious companion guides him through a world teetering between reality and nightmare, where the line between life and death grows increasingly blurred. In this desolate and unsettling landscape, Andruccio confronts his deepest fears and the legends that shape his destiny. His journey becomes a spiritual battle, a quest for salvation that is not merely physical but profoundly existential. In a crescendo of emotional and visual tension, Andruccio will discover that true redemption lies not in evading death but in mastering the art of accepting it. A powerful and visceral drama that delves into the struggle for survival, the resilience of hope, and the courage to face the inevitable.","popularity":0.6249,"poster_path":"/oNFYh96DIxHgwdDu0Nr3BWbmHL8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Between life and death, a journey to redemption.\"","title":"MIRTILLO - numerus IX","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Mirtillo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4024391,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fabio Fieri","original_name":"Fabio Fieri","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":"/9JkusBXyHzLodaRCspJXj3tpQrp.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Andruccio","credit_id":"676fe9fb0c4402b63192c078","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4024384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paolo Baiocco","original_name":"Paolo Baiocco","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/csKhMQeMpmp2tgSFeQhC8TU9Zju.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Friar","credit_id":"676fea262c9097b2666183f5","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1500677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesco Sechi","original_name":"Francesco Sechi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/ufi41pMvsaLL7K9W0ZxEGXqhWVN.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hanged man","credit_id":"676fea387d1bc87de761464c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1793142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desiderio Sanzi","original_name":"Desiderio Sanzi","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/rGRCRAuGXyaragWOcAIyaoAywj5.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Actor","credit_id":"676fea557d1bc87de7614665","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1793142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desiderio Sanzi","original_name":"Desiderio Sanzi","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/rGRCRAuGXyaragWOcAIyaoAywj5.jpg","credit_id":"676feb691efc2434cf12d952","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1795171,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniele Cruccolini","original_name":"Daniele Cruccolini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bqqrnSKlA52zGRDGCYMekUxlxEQ.jpg","credit_id":"676feb7b1efc2434cf12d963","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nQm39sqpxZa9d665dJK3GJQf6l2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/oNFYh96DIxHgwdDu0Nr3BWbmHL8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":344388,"name":"mirtillo"},{"id":344389,"name":"mirtilloix"},{"id":344390,"name":"mirtillofilm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MIRTILLO - numerus IX | Official Trailer (2025 Movie)","key":"rt6w8EnFsiM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-12-24T23:01:06.000Z","id":"676fe9461efc2434cf12d8ee"}]}}}
