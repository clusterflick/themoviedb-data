Set against a backdrop of oppression, each woman's voice becomes a powerful testament to life under an authoritarian regime that restricts freedom and autonomy, especially for women. Through deeply personal narratives, they share experiences of defiance and survival, offering profound insight into the psychological and emotional scars of exile. The film also follows the journey of a woman artist who, through her art, embodies the struggles of her homeland. Her creative process unfolds in vivid detail as she channels frustration, sorrow, and hope into a piece that powerfully symbolizes the oppression faced by Iranian women. This artwork emerges as a visceral expression of shared pain, resilience, and the unyielding desire for freedom.","popularity":0.0338,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":248557,"logo_path":null,"name":"MazArtHouse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Exile Echoes weaves together the voices of four generations of Iranian women, revealing their shared memories and resilience in the face of an oppressive regime's relentless campaign against women's freedom and rights.","title":"Exile Echoes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5144636,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maryam Takalou","original_name":"Maryam Takalou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Maryam","credit_id":"676f66e4fb8a229c6792845a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5144637,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moojan Hakim","original_name":"Moojan Hakim","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"676f66ebfb8a229c67928465","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5144638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vajihe Zamaniderkani","original_name":"Vajihe Zamaniderkani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Neda","credit_id":"676f66f4fb8a229c67928470","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5144639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zahra Jafarpour","original_name":"Zahra Jafarpour","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"676f66faaa8f3159d612cc44","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5144640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mazyar Mahan","original_name":"Mazyar Mahan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676f6705d0b08f9718616fda","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5144641,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neda Sheyda","original_name":"Neda Sheyda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676f670ed0b08f9718616fe6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5144640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mazyar Mahan","original_name":"Mazyar Mahan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676f6717d0b08f9718616fed","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5144642,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fatemeh Baigmoradi","original_name":"Fatemeh Baigmoradi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676f671fd0b08f9718616ff8","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1831950,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sepideh Abdolvahab","original_name":"Sepideh Abdolvahab","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676f6735f9bc02e49892b6fb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4568737,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Hirad Alavifard","original_name":"Hirad Alavifard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676f6746fb8a229c6792847b","department":"Sound","job":"Dialogue Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1765366,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ensieh Maleki","original_name":"Ensieh Maleki","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676f675a2c9097b2666174cd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1765366,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ensieh Maleki","original_name":"Ensieh Maleki","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676f676c2c9097b2666174d0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5144643,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sadaf Amini","original_name":"Sadaf Amini","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676f6777f9bc02e49892b712","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fa","note":"","release_date":"2024-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
