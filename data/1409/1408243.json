The documentary fiction Orangemond by Gabriele Denecke was created in 1979/80 as part of her master's student studies with Frank Beyer at what was then the GDR University of Film and Television in Potsdam-Babelsberg. The film was not completed. After viewing the raw material, the university decided that there would be no editing for the film. Eventually Gabriele Denecke was only able to put the film together in the sequence of scenes.","popularity":0.2584,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orangemond","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1573344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriele Denecke","original_name":"Gabriele Denecke","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e86f9e2976ba75b92b1f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1573344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriele Denecke","original_name":"Gabriele Denecke","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e8701355bec07b092b634","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1573344,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriele Denecke","original_name":"Gabriele Denecke","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e8707bf10ff1984616c87","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2MtJ10oNT0Lq8OUD7YOzMmAcAR6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"GDR University of Film and Television","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bald 70 - Filme der Filmuniversit√§t","release_date":"2024-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
