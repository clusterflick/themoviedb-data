Discipline and productivity in Japan are much more regimented than in many other parts of the world. For the 110 million Japanese, survival means doing things together, rather than asserting a North American-style individualism. Japan's industry has automated and computerized at an unparalleled rate. Open-concept offices and collaborative work styles offer a model of the changing style of modern work that could inspire the West to modify their processes as well.","popularity":0.0962,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":3030,"logo_path":"/9qE1ID398SaX9zYiRiPHdZfPTbt.png","name":"KCTS Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":156745,"logo_path":null,"name":"University of Washington","origin_country":""},{"id":222574,"logo_path":null,"name":"Psychomedia Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Japan Inc: Lessons for North America?","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","title":"Japon Inc. - Un modèle pour l'Amérique du Nord?","type":"French"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2692646,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stan Peters","original_name":"Stan Peters","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"676f6a66eb742f45de9295d0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5144661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hideo Iso","original_name":"Hideo Iso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"676f6acfeb742f45de929606","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1846577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kalle Lasn","original_name":"Kalle Lasn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gJDd8ZNyqcHnZK3L85OFZb4aVcx.jpg","credit_id":"676f6830bf10ff1984618ddc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1846577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kalle Lasn","original_name":"Kalle Lasn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gJDd8ZNyqcHnZK3L85OFZb4aVcx.jpg","credit_id":"676f6838bf10ff1984618de0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1846577,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kalle Lasn","original_name":"Kalle Lasn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gJDd8ZNyqcHnZK3L85OFZb4aVcx.jpg","credit_id":"676f6845bf10ff1984618de4","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29055,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joe Wiesenfeld","original_name":"Joe Wiesenfeld","popularity":0.0728,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676f685dfb8a229c679284a1","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1347893,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Jones","original_name":"Peter Jones","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676f68a2769852f29012c7ba","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1563493,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Taylor","original_name":"John Taylor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676f68efeb742f45de92955f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5144663,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Sharpe","original_name":"Paul Sharpe","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676f6b5d769852f29012c894","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2621161,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"John Coney","original_name":"John Coney","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676f6b892c9097b26661759c","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0226010","wikidata_id":"Q120495655","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tdZgVxhuuLDOasM9PGZF8YmpSse.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Japan Inc Lessons for North America","key":"toOH6oM3WhQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2023-05-04T16:07:42.000Z","id":"676f70358258294bb8617d35"}]}}}
