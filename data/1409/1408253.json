Aiming to practice a more traditional lifestyle, and asserting aboriginal title to the land, they stayed for three years, having occasional violent clashes with the local residents. In 1977 they negotiated a (somewhat complicated) land swap with the State, and agreed to move to a permanent home near Plattsburgh, New York, where they remain today. Ganienkeh is one of the only examples of an indigenous people successfully reclaiming land from the United States, but it may not be the last.","popularity":0.2926,"poster_path":"/rD4cRHUnjA8ZUjGCQAs5UXcHZU9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The untold story of Ganienkeh, a Mohawk community fighting to regain its traditional culture.","title":"This Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5143360,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Bradley","original_name":"Mike Bradley","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e910f3dff0de99b6170a6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2437015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Whitney Skauge","original_name":"Whitney Skauge","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e912262ba310fc012c9b5","department":"Editing","job":"Consulting Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34754081","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":2945,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rD4cRHUnjA8ZUjGCQAs5UXcHZU9.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/oBPTituxMW7nreqPw0ZI85DbW1S.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6086,"name":"government"},{"id":1551,"name":"indigenous"},{"id":8519,"name":"mohawk"},{"id":282080,"name":"documentary"},{"id":325353,"name":"land back"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
