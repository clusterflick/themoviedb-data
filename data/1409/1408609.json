The tycho of Uranus Net Company, Brian Keyes, is sponsoring a beauty contest on the island to choose \"a companion for the moon prince\", based on local legends. Rock star Alex is invited out to judge the contest. While there he stumbles upon a necklace on the site. The female archaeologist Eileen demands the return of an important artifact, and sparks fly between their two stubborn personalities. Meanwhile we learn that Brian Keyes is not what he seems — he is actually working on mind-control and genetic alterations with the help of his mad scientist. While fleeing from Brian, who wants Alex's genius DNA, Alex, Eileen and their friends stumble across a hidden chamber belonging to the ancient Lunar Palace.
