Turbulence in her childhood home leaves her conflicted between trying to achieve her lifelong dream or nurturing her family’s kindred spirits. With the help of her witty, laissez-faire childhood friend Nina, Anise is determined to leave old patterns of behaviour behind and pledges pen-to-paper to fulfil her aspiring acting career. Through the creation of a list designed to ‘fix her’, we follow Anise as she attempts to overcome her feelings of responsibility to help others, versus living for herself.","popularity":0.0599,"poster_path":"/gf6EfepSKMfDhqGwGjfXAXDeUoh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159898,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dolly Llama Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2024-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Hope This Will Fix Me","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5143154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Wesley","original_name":"Claire Wesley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Anise","credit_id":"676e5cce4ca2fbbfca616363","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikayla Levy","original_name":"Mikayla Levy","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Nina","credit_id":"676e5ce00c4402b63192954b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4729016,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Jaulin","original_name":"Amy Jaulin","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sage","credit_id":"676e5d0b1efc2434cf12a6b2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5143156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jago Field","original_name":"Jago Field","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jake","credit_id":"676e5d170c4402b631929560","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3077785,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermione Gehle","original_name":"Hermione Gehle","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Anise's Mother","credit_id":"676e5d398258294bb8616498","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5143157,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyrah Victorien","original_name":"Kyrah Victorien","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Gracie","credit_id":"676e5d48d0b08f9718615224","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hassibullah Kushkaki","original_name":"Hassibullah Kushkaki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e5d84cfe62644df12afa7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hassibullah Kushkaki","original_name":"Hassibullah Kushkaki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e5dadf9454eeb1d92994d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5143154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claire Wesley","original_name":"Claire Wesley","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e5db98258294bb86164bf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hassibullah Kushkaki","original_name":"Hassibullah Kushkaki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e5dc98258294bb86164c8","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hassibullah Kushkaki","original_name":"Hassibullah Kushkaki","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e5de0f9454eeb1d929963","department":"Editing","job":"Co-Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5143159,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Hamza Shiban","original_name":"Hamza Shiban","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e5e01d6d10ecc8c12ae00","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3848820,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Brittney Tammisto","original_name":"Brittney Tammisto","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e5e22cfe62644df12afea","department":"Production","job":"Production Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt28757695","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gf6EfepSKMfDhqGwGjfXAXDeUoh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"WA Made Film Festival","release_date":"2024-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"I Hope This Will Fix Me | Official Trailer 2024","key":"PCkS3ymFr94","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-12-03T12:47:44.000Z","id":"676e5fbee2976ba75b92a7a8"}]}}}
