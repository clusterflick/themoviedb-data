Stanislas, a young anarchist poet who seeks to assassinate her, enters her room, wounded; he looks exactly like the dead king, and the Queen shelters him instead of handing him over to the police. She sees him as the welcome embodiment of her own death, calling him Azraël. An ambiguous love develops between them, uniting them in a bid to outwit the machinations of the court politicians, represented by the Comte de Foëhn, the chief of police, and Édith de Berg, the Queen's companion. In order to remain true to their ideals and to each other, the Queen and Stanislas have to play their parts in a bizarre private tragedy, which the world will never understand.","popularity":0.2254,"poster_path":"/gBUbaQ2P2FXxRRR40X2uCF7d7ME.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Eagle with Two Heads","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3935686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Todoroki Yuu","original_name":"轟悠","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/5QLnrnME5n6jIvd4gQfUPw38TLX.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Stanislas","credit_id":"676f83becfe62644df12d9c4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3135114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Misaki Rion","original_name":"実咲凜音","popularity":0.2713,"profile_path":"/cJwwpAZmOmQ6oQ0rkOZm3gVOzIu.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Queen","credit_id":"676f83c7eb742f45de9299e3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3135126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aizuki Hikaru","original_name":"愛月ひかる","popularity":0.1492,"profile_path":"/s7zkHQg2TBuY5XNeVuC00B9vf8V.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Comte de Foëhn","credit_id":"676f83e1d6d10ecc8c12d279","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3135132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sakuragi Minato","original_name":"桜木みなと","popularity":0.1319,"profile_path":"/lTfwP8hw5GOriGMs7VS2MEijro6.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Félix de Willenstein","credit_id":"676f83f98258294bb8617ebe","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3135139,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazuki Sora","original_name":"和希そら","popularity":0.1115,"profile_path":"/yKSCy9x2fxETOpoqH7nJF3y1Va6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Storyteller","credit_id":"676f84030c4402b63192b51d","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3945070,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ueda Keiko","original_name":"植田景子","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676f841c8258294bb8617eca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.66,"height":909,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gBUbaQ2P2FXxRRR40X2uCF7d7ME.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":276810,"name":"takarazuka"},{"id":284843,"name":"takarazuka revue"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2016-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
