She has not told her garden of her immanent demise; she will not lightly share the news with anybody, anywhere, as if death is a unique occurence. The film was made using a pinscreen animation device. The soundtrack consists of harp improvisation inspired by the poem.","popularity":0.0553,"poster_path":"/wSUte6rFEUpbgEotTM6NkrUxb24.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2024-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I hav'nt told my garden yet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":937993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Einan","original_name":"Annie Einan","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"(voice)","credit_id":"67896503e98081f58297912f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3049349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diek Grobler","original_name":"Diek Grobler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676ef838cfe62644df12c563","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5183929,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Anne Vanschothorst","original_name":"Anne Vanschothorst","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"678966e71403701c991d6377","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7jT6cbmTJBQMvouKeYGefrGhKT5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ikZNjfowNuqodkkjFjVzt7gRh3s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/k70IhvCxMfoeOKVnsiwEXpIob5F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2480,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wSUte6rFEUpbgEotTM6NkrUxb24.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1754}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"BANG Awards Festival","release_date":"2024-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
