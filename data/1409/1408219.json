Falling into a deep sleep, Danny is visited by his computer who proceeds to explain why he shouldn't be afraid of computers.  Starting with identifying the similarities between a typewriter and a computer keyboard and stressing that a computer is nothing more than an information processing machine that combines, sorts, and rearranges numbers, the program quickly dispells much of the mystery surrounding this increasingly important part of our lives.  By speaking in simple terms, we are made to understand that the computer is basically dumb until it receives direction from a human operator.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/6jUEjfZ207wJYhTVmIGCbpHok3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":248485,"logo_path":null,"name":"Increase Video","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Designed to demystify computers by explaining similarities with other machines and defining computer terminology.","title":"Don't Be Afraid of Computers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1738,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/6jUEjfZ207wJYhTVmIGCbpHok3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1159}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1983-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
