When she moved to Gaza in 2005, she felt a powerful sense of optimism following the Israeli withdrawal. But by 2009, war had badly damaged its infrastructure, neighbourhoods, businesses and communities – and that optimism had evaporated.  Now, in the wake of the even more destructive war that began on 7th October 2023, Mariam seeks out the people she has met in Gaza over the years – and reflects on the wasted potential and devastated lives after sixteen years of blockade and a year of one of the most destructive wars in Middle East history.","popularity":0.1288,"poster_path":"/ujafkvG6IfPFkB1Yl1DhqWlN6Vy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215208,"logo_path":null,"name":"aljazeeradocumentary","origin_country":""},{"id":248476,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maysara Films","origin_country":""},{"id":62165,"logo_path":"/9i15HMPXjW657H4BnrMkeQcbktL.png","name":"Al Jazeera","origin_country":"QA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"}],"release_date":"2024-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echoes of a Lost Gaza","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3155054,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariam Shahin","original_name":"Mariam Shahin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/nxsDiubdlnHDNf3dB1O7tEGvdUM.jpg","credit_id":"676e3be6769852f29012a074","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3573858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Azar","original_name":"George Azar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e3d778258294bb861612f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9C78DkGMXrP5a3GFttsL7V2fGHu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ujafkvG6IfPFkB1Yl1DhqWlN6Vy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":174109,"name":"documentary filmmaking"},{"id":339405,"name":"gaza massacres"},{"id":344327,"name":"life in gaza"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"","release_date":"2024-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Echoes of a Lost Gaza - 2024 version | Featured Documentary","key":"BrrXmsrP03w","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2024-10-27T15:37:24.000Z","id":"676e3e77d0b08f9718614ffc"}]}}}
