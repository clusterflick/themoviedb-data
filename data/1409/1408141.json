The fanzine is the love for your club and the game down on paper. They reflect the togetherness, the obsession, the minor detail, the passion that gives the game all its value. If we are to galvanize any mass movement against today’s sterilized corporate football climate, where the fan is still so often an after-thought then the values that the fanzine movement created should be at its core.","popularity":0.1408,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":248475,"logo_path":null,"name":"1886
