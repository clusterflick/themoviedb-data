A portrait of interrupted dialogue, the testimony of the discomfort and resistance of citizens facing enemies as familiar as they are unexpected. The documentary brings together the voice of exile and the vindication of the right to return and the innocence of a shared past. A story built from testimonies, memory, still photographs and voice notes.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"},{"iso_3166_1":"CF","name":"Central African Republic"}],"release_date":"2023-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vecinos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5142911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Salym Fayad","original_name":"Salym Fayad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e23ead0b08f9718614c7c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5142912,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcela Ascencio","original_name":"Marcela Ascencio","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676e23f8d0b08f9718614c86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
