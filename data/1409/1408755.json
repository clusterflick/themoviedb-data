This visceral short film takes the myth behind this flower, about a maiden named Caltha who yearned so badly for Apollo that she withered and turned into a flower, and turns it into a sweeping portrayal of desire. Exploring the impact of floods – both on literal and emotional level – Isabel Legate creates a sensory experience with striking colors over black-and-white imagery that captures the sensation of being washed away by something bigger than yourself.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caltha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5145397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ines Borovac","original_name":"Ines Borovac","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6770016c6cc4caf8fb928e6f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5145392,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Isabel Legate","original_name":"Isabel Legate","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"67700173bf10ff1984619e4a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5145392,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Isabel Legate","original_name":"Isabel Legate","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677001116cc4caf8fb928e35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5145392,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Isabel Legate","original_name":"Isabel Legate","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6770011a6cc4caf8fb928e42","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5145392,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Isabel Legate","original_name":"Isabel Legate","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6770011f7d1bc87de7614bb8","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5145392,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Isabel Legate","original_name":"Isabel Legate","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677001253dff0de99b61a016","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5145394,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Fasano","original_name":"Brian Fasano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677001373dff0de99b61a022","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5145394,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Brian Fasano","original_name":"Brian Fasano","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"677001467d1bc87de7614bd7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eyw5IXvusNzvtgUIcVluyt47B0r.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Caltha – trailer | IFFR 2025","key":"ZWX-NMhpiMQ","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-12-19T10:56:33.000Z","id":"677001917d1bc87de7614c10"}]}}}
