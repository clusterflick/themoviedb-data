The film opens with unflinching footage of Liang’s own laser eye surgery, which leaves her with a persistent ‘halo’ distortion in her left eye. In this sensitive short film about the transformative power of grief, the ‘halo’ becomes both a symbol of impaired vision and an enigmatic marker of loss, subtly shifting the way we perceive the world around us.","popularity":0.0482,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After Lasik","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5145349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shannon Liang","original_name":"Shannon Liang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676ffaf50c4402b63192c481","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5145349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shannon Liang","original_name":"Shannon Liang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676ffaff8258294bb8618998","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5145349,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shannon Liang","original_name":"Shannon Liang","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676ffb031efc2434cf12dc1a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ieCMzhO3luojuYOWPtTqLGfQt02.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1296}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"WET film Exhibition","release_date":"2024-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
