According to the plot, the peasants tried to pull out a huge налим, which was stuck under a snag. The peasants were joined by a local shepherd, a carpenter and a lordly coachman, and then by the master Andrei Andreich himself, who watched this scene for a long time. As a result, the налим hit Andrey Andreyevich with its tail, and the fish left the hapless fishermen.","popularity":0.1484,"poster_path":"/avlop3RygPYq2hgRR4mvLlKsv4C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68613,"logo_path":null,"name":"Belgoskino","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1938-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nalim","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2083063,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pavel Pervushin","original_name":"Павел Первушин","popularity":0.1237,"profile_path":"/1N8lVsQcPx0x2PWjUoEW0birPSe.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"67d716395963ebffde7c081d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1721695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fedor Slavski","original_name":"Фёдор Славский","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"67d716785963ebffde7c0842","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5308720,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"S.
