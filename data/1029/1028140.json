The narrative conveys that didko is waiting for everyone who misbehaves and will torture them. Only this work doesn't depict them in a traditional way, with little horns upon the pig's face, with goat legs and covered in fur. Instead, it suggests their appearance as humans, implying that anyone could be a sinner and anyone could be a devil.","popularity":0.0602,"poster_path":"/su7YBTSmzeoqXgZBANEp3SWdi49.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking Through the Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"Дивні: Ходять лісом","type":"title for music video version"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","title":"The Weird: Walking Through the Forest","type":"informal English title for music video version"}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3714282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Dzonkovskyi","original_name":"Roman Dzonkovskyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632f63bb7719d7007f6b6ae6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3714282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Dzonkovskyi","original_name":"Roman Dzonkovskyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632f63c9663b87007db03640","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3714282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Roman Dzonkovskyi","original_name":"Roman Dzonkovskyi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632f63d4dd47160084436eff","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3308059,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Yuriy Pidtserkovny","original_name":"Yuriy Pidtserkovny","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"632f63e42b8a43007f3a372b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22261494","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/su7YBTSmzeoqXgZBANEp3SWdi49.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"uk","file_path":"/2zPoNN7Aq0Uq5ojzyQsiwVcgwmd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bardak Film Fest","release_date":"2022-10-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Linoleum International Contemporary Animation and Media Art Festival","release_date":"2022-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
