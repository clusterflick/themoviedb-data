Abandoned objects, such as cars and computer screens, were captured with the help of photogrammetry to create a video collage composed of extracts from reality. Re-contextualized in disproportionately large proportions within landscapes seen from afar, these objects stand out like the ruins of monumental architecture. The absence of life as well as the luminous atmosphere of the work create a tension between apocalyptic feeling and nostalgia, between precious object and waste, between idealized nature and the indelible presence of human traces. These vestiges of the Anthropocene are deployed within an interactive installation in collaboration with Guillaume Arseneault, and a soundtrack composed by Roger Tellier-Craig. This is the single-channel version of the project.","popularity":0.0423,"poster_path":"/mOF1wuaz7Efz77bNV6XXbDQ7Y7J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Objets-monde I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1517759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sabrina Ratté","original_name":"Sabrina Ratté","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/zz3RPbpjeuNAD9bNoDr943xlr3h.jpg","credit_id":"63308710abdec0007b536519","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mOF1wuaz7Efz77bNV6XXbDQ7Y7J.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"","release_date":"2022-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
