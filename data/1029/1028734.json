Under the guise of the best interests of these children and of the nation, France, the United States, Great Britain and the countries of Central Europe embarked on a veritable race for children. By demographic opportunism, by fear of seeing them indoctrinated by a new totalitarianism, these countries move and adopt these orphans, erasing their history and their identity.","popularity":0.2484,"poster_path":"/IHQnj7TrIaHvSQuj0GEU3nbbkk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110993,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elephant Adventures","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2756,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vertigo Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104097,"logo_path":"/tzhYtZqLNn0TFEQ27dmT8qFTEA1.png","name":"Kwassa Films","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":161003,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lutecia Film","origin_country":""},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children of Chaos","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2299157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agnès Pizzini","original_name":"Agnès Pizzini","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6331481a6f6a990083a509db","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Johan","original_name":"Julien Johan","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6331483f629b2c007d54ff61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958651,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julien Johan","original_name":"Julien Johan","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63314899cede69007eaec0f1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2299157,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Agnès Pizzini","original_name":"Agnès Pizzini","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6331480f7719d7007f6c005c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1972812,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hugues Nancy","original_name":"Hugues Nancy","popularity":0.0822,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633148b6629b2c007aa5f7c3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589429,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jérôme Rebotier","original_name":"Jérôme Rebotier","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":"/3j3BszOxWr6cXhmKBhm4RDjGnfB.jpg","credit_id":"633148f97719d7007ac4ebf3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt26695922","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4IcgtKLzKkyZSgYgXrxgUfkEDG8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/2dnjwBGK346nkaCtVuejDOjvRlP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":988,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/34RIf3JJJhHJ4uzfbrMAUWWIhMw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1756}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/IHQnj7TrIaHvSQuj0GEU3nbbkk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":800},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/J8Hp5o8RBrQAxLz8ePxiuO5UeI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.759,"height":1318,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/RBGwiGOe33ugRN5XkTlhptmTMP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/5YtT4IpFSnp6OQIDRJDGpiybXMm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":810},{"aspect_ratio":0.682,"height":1099,"iso_639_1":"ca","file_path":"/e3MOkxaUjUM4L8BsgdXHPPaSdD1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"France 5","release_date":"2022-09-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
