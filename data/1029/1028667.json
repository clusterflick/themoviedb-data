Through a meeting between three women, \"from soil to soul\" reflects on what it is like to be human today: The need to be in contact with nature, the urge to create something of your own and express yourself, and the desire for community and to feel alive. Together, the musicians Johanna and Marianna and the gardener Ana get time to stand still.","popularity":0.0961,"poster_path":"/bhbvogNvkeQqWi6IXTCnJ7ZqM2W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183050,"logo_path":"/9s6QTzCUEO21bHXSQht1DuL6PCh.png","name":"Heapsgood Motion Pictures","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2022-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"from soil to soul","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Seim","original_name":"Johanna Seim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6330ec73663b8700855943d2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715856,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marianna Sangita","original_name":"Marianna Sangita","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6330ec7ba5d849007bd461d1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Julie Verbelen","original_name":"Ana Julie Verbelen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6330ecc3cede69007b880054","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Seim","original_name":"Johanna Seim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330ecf4d38b58007bfc2c07","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Seim","original_name":"Johanna Seim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330ecff8d2f8d007b01b09b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2495874,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fredrik Harreschou","original_name":"Fredrik Harreschou","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330ed16006b01007e1a3eb6","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2224012,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Elisabeth Sommer","original_name":"Elisabeth Sommer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330ed62006b0100833d00c0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3167582,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Holz","original_name":"Michael Holz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330ed7840d0fe007fe36025","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3167582,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Michael Holz","original_name":"Michael Holz","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330ed842a210c007fd1b7a4","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2730221,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Liew Ceng Teng","original_name":"Liew Ceng Teng","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330ed98006b01007e1a3f00","department":"Sound","job":"Production Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715859,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Patrick Webb","original_name":"Patrick Webb","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330edacabdafc008403da34","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715859,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Patrick Webb","original_name":"Patrick Webb","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330edbd6f6a9900804e3152","department":"Sound","job":"Production Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715859,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Patrick Webb","original_name":"Patrick Webb","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330edd08d2f8d00928f4a61","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715859,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Patrick Webb","original_name":"Patrick Webb","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330edda9ac535007ce30b76","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715861,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jonathan Sarrabia","original_name":"Jonathan Sarrabia","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330edf2abdafc007cd9da60","department":"Editing","job":"Additional Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Seim","original_name":"Johanna Seim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330edfe006b01007e1a3f3d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715862,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Emil B.
