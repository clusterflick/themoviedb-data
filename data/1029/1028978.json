The painter's sole heir was the young artist Harry Holtzman. During the German Blitz of London in 1940, Holtzman had arranged for Mondrian to come to New York. Holtzman rented an apartment-studio for him, and during the next three and a half years he was one of Mondrianâ€™s most intimate associates.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/4JSNUO8LJMVWGUp5MEWqb1rbKuC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1944-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Impression of Piet Mondrian's New York Studio and His Last Painting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3717118,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Holtzman","original_name":"Harry Holtzman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633250406f6a99007b96abcf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3739470","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4JSNUO8LJMVWGUp5MEWqb1rbKuC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":943},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1416,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/x3QsQQgW9dA9ozabocx26pLeb6Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":944},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1546,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8caGNW06C6mO3REIs8rrAGqPVkL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1030},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2477,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3zyv4T8O2nCNtuaEL0PCyWeYZCq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1651},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ax135p7yViKFxnbTrNsXiiK2zs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":501},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4wXNJ2QKHlkQUsBHGiFjq7gkIjG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1944-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
