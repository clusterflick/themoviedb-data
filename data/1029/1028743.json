Radio, sketches, boulevard theater, operetta, cinema, songs whimsical or tender, Bourvil is present in all areas of popular culture. Carried by the voice of Valérie Lemercier, this portrait of the artist allows us to rediscover his most beautiful songs, from Les Crayons to La Tendresse, and the highlights of his filmography, from the cult scenes of La Traversée de Paris, Le Corniaud and La Grande Vadrouille to Le Cercle rouge. We also rediscover the richness of his career as a singer and actor, with some little known nuggets. The testimony of Bourvil's two sons, unpublished family films and numerous archives tell the story of the all too brief life of this endearing man.","popularity":0.2713,"poster_path":"/gyoVpU92WpNFpvBz8csXVumJofa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14192,"logo_path":"/47lcrWxgpnd5jM3oKm0EkEkF7Ji.png","name":"KCRAFT&CO","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Traversée de Bourvil","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":62531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valérie Lemercier","original_name":"Valérie Lemercier","popularity":0.4948,"profile_path":"/wyLSF00dS2BVE6bySBHte7pgdSg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator (voice)","credit_id":"63315d75cede69007eaecbda","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bourvil","original_name":"Bourvil","popularity":0.3799,"profile_path":"/h9eYqmgnBhRoccnTFKo0Y05dI8b.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"65a5c8ea988afd012d894cc2","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1391908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bernard Faroux","original_name":"Bernard Faroux","popularity":0.0674,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63315b24abdafc0084040536","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30783739","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kEWsI3vEVXJtH5F8sTLgdHPyc1H.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gU86CUaYtSARbiPuHwqxdDCxEFa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":787,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7TCu1JReevJoyGrrcnb6uTID0pN.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1400}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/gyoVpU92WpNFpvBz8csXVumJofa.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/5crkUYylu9odhc7VDsNOvbCtndQ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"},{"id":154866,"name":"archive footage"},{"id":239463,"name":"film archives"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
