This film uses evocative photogrphy and a dignified rhythm to depict the death of peasant culture. This fact is brought home by the super 8 footage shot ten years earlier. Blank's familiarity with the villagers and their unsselfconsciousness in front of the camera produce a high degree of authenticity in this account of culture of the 'mezzadria'.","popularity":0.0502,"poster_path":"/p66amQXTLr6hthiEoapBr6ru41S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Divided Earth","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosemarie Blank","original_name":"Rosemarie Blank","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330ca10c525c4007fedee98","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosemarie Blank","original_name":"Rosemarie Blank","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330ca28663b87007db0b7fe","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosemarie Blank","original_name":"Rosemarie Blank","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330ca412a210c007fd1b1a7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosemarie Blank","original_name":"Rosemarie Blank","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330ca54629b2c008285824f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668815,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rosemarie Blank","original_name":"Rosemarie Blank","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330ca6f8d2f8d00928f4569","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2475988,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ali Reza Movahed","original_name":"Ali Reza Movahed","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330ca90a5046e0084beedb6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1327568,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frans van de Staak","original_name":"Frans van de Staak","popularity":0.1168,"profile_path":"/3QON6KnDCObYAM24a0QkLhm1LFq.jpg","credit_id":"6330caa8293835007d8270b7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715718,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Karl Baumgartner","original_name":"Karl Baumgartner","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330cad9d38b580092a89d0b","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715720,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Oliviero Barbanera","original_name":"Oliviero Barbanera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330cafec525c4007a21c825","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715721,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rosana Barbanera","original_name":"Rosana Barbanera","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330cb11e32943007e2683ab","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3715740,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jan Dop","original_name":"Jan Dop","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6330ce62663b870085594027","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0376245","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":1047,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/p66amQXTLr6hthiEoapBr6ru41S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750},{"aspect_ratio":0.716,"height":1047,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/8E37bSe3j1XIiFLcSPD1EShrwhg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"nl","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"QT La Terra in Due 1985","key":"302063440","site":"Vimeo","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2018-11-21T13:19:44.000Z","id":"6330cd71d7f465008265c6ad"}]}}}
