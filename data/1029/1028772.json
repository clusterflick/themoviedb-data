Mr. Ebitsuka was a teacher at Tama Art University, and he happened to be appointed concurrently to the second department of art, where I work, and we became close. He was born in 1951, so he is 16 years younger than me. I wanted to think about and experience the \"contemporary art\" that I hadn't been to. And he, being selfish, visited his atelier and was shown around his works on an island in the Seto Inland Sea. For me, the year 2000 was a year of Ebitsuka-san's sculptures.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2DfrEaPQBb3IixSLcEh3yp5cddF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"EBIZUKA in my own field","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3716265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Koichi Ebitsuka","original_name":"Koichi Ebitsuka","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"633181e8663b87008559805f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2142869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzuki Shiroyasu","original_name":"鈴木志郎康","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"6331821bcede69007b884393","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2142869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzuki Shiroyasu","original_name":"鈴木志郎康","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63318205e329430092ab0345","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2142869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzuki Shiroyasu","original_name":"鈴木志郎康","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63318200cede69007b884388","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2142869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzuki Shiroyasu","original_name":"鈴木志郎康","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"633181fa006b01007b903267","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3716266,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Yukiko Tomita","original_name":"Yukiko Tomita","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6331822a663b87007db1131d","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3716268,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kazufumi Ozawa","original_name":"Kazufumi Ozawa","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63318233006b01007e1a824b","department":"Crew","job":"Thanks"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2142869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suzuki Shiroyasu","original_name":"鈴木志郎康","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6331820fa5d849009255e015","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xnqslVD7Mr8a4ZSwu2PKf3KrsqB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2DfrEaPQBb3IixSLcEh3yp5cddF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
