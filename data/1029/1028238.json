It shoots directly to the point with poetry and images that evoke controversy in one mind set and passion in another. Depression and suicide are met head on with Cuthand's honesty. Anhedonia shocks people into opening their eyes to the source of the illness in the Aboriginal community. Statistics, split images, words and flesh meld together making this short film long on compassion, screaming out for help and recognition of the mentally ill's dream of someday having a normal life.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/ax3GEDsLlZRCReXXEfAQ5VhCYhT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anhedonia","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2443952,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"TJ Cuthand","original_name":"TJ Cuthand","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":"/4JLlsjmDUI0Evn4AuceqFbUrPn0.jpg","credit_id":"632f9f5a39a1a60080053ba2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ax3GEDsLlZRCReXXEfAQ5VhCYhT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
