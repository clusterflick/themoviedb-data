Together, they completed more than 800 hours of filming 128 volcanic eruptions and developed more than 450,000 films of great aesthetic and scientific value. A journey in stages around the world, the film pays tribute to the two protagonists, from the first ascent accomplished by Maurice, then aged 7, at Stromboli, to their tragic disappearance in 1991 on Mount Unzen in Japan.","popularity":0.2055,"poster_path":"/tJDfcPTVoFjJ6d7BStSqvbFo61J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183015,"logo_path":null,"name":"SZ
