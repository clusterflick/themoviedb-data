That is why her son Alexander shows excessive care and forbids his mother to leave the house. She has long since come to terms with home isolation, but once a year she just needs to leave the house. And this day is a meeting of classmates, where Halyna hopes to meet her school love. Her son tries to prevent this, because every time there are some problems with the old woman. The ingenious pensioner goes to various tricks to get to school in the evening in any way. She expects to meet there with her school love Gennady, who ignored all the previous 60 meetings of classmates. But Halyna is sure that this time the love, endured for decades, will still visit the annual event.","popularity":0.1721,"poster_path":"/A0ffq7437AGJl15Gnzh4DIztjGP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remember
