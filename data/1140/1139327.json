Tim Miller explores bits and pieces of his body, in the same manner than, piece by piece, the story keeps flowing and ‘giving birth’ to the queer body. Through storytelling and movement, and stories of love, enchantment, disenchantment, and resistance, this solo show transforms a personal story into the story of a community. The ghost of fear and death appears with the AIDS epidemic, the loss of friends and loved ones, police brutality against gay people, and the State of California anti gay laws and homophobic harassment. A travel in time through the body, Tim Miller’s striking performance invokes the bodies of those who are absent but present at the same time. The gesture of envisioning a future with a United States’ lesbian president, with sexual freedom, and without homophobia, transforms sex into a call to life and hope.","popularity":0.0509,"poster_path":"/rrzsvgX1KaXUwaitTKnRkib6Puw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tim Miller: My Queer Body","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4108362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Miller","original_name":"Tim Miller","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"6487348899259c00accde51c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4943466,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard L.
