Cars roar past, without even touching the ground. The whole picture is hanging in abeyance. A continuous zoom-out expands the view of the scene, crossing the space between near and far, fading from concrete to abstract, from tangible to intangible. The music meanders around the image, picking up on visual movements, following them for a while before breaking off and following its own rhythm. Beginning with pumping bass sounds, the tone rises continuously until finally becoming almost inaudible.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rauschen & Brausen I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2639617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Burkhardt","original_name":"Daniel Burkhardt","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64860490c9dbf900ad467474","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
