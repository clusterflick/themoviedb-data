All too often they find themselves caught up in secret sin, hanging out with the wrong crowd, and living in outright rebellion toward authority. Such is the case for Jeremy (Wyatt Cope), in \"Second Chance.\" With his relationship with his parents at the breaking point, he ignores their loving pleas to get right with God and delves even deeper into the evil life of “freedom” he’s always wanted, until a horrific tragedy changes everything. It’s his final wake-up call. One last time, God reaches out to give Jeremy a second chance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/dFz6DsaW7cS8rc7n4brz44vQ9hA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":202016,"logo_path":null,"name":"Our Time Ministries","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Second Chance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4108024,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abe Koehn","original_name":"Abe Koehn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6486bfddd2b20900ad3d5228","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4108025,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brenda Hammes","original_name":"Brenda Hammes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6486bfe8c0348b013c1d6c43","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4108027,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bryn Leppert","original_name":"Bryn Leppert","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6486bff3d2b209012dfd3ce9","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4108028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chase Poort","original_name":"Chase Poort","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6486bffdd2b209014e0a0568","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4108030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Pena","original_name":"David Pena","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6486c00bd2b20900ca205938","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4108031,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Hammes","original_name":"Jeff Hammes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"6486c015bf31f2505f3f6f51","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4108032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Brown","original_name":"Joseph Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"6486c020bf31f25057073cef","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4108033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Cope","original_name":"Kelly Cope","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6486c02bd2b209014e0a058d","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4108034,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kody Hammes","original_name":"Kody Hammes","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6486c032d2b20900ca205961","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4108035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wyatt Cope","original_name":"Wyatt Cope","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6486c03bd2b209014e0a059c","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4108036,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Katie Garraway","original_name":"Katie Garraway","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6486c051c0348b011fbdcce4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4108037,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Caleb Garraway","original_name":"Caleb Garraway","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/958P3uoGD2fs2Yjbw1HPKYxxaSw.jpg","credit_id":"6486c062e2726000e8c1b4cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4108032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Brown","original_name":"Joseph Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6486c07699259c01392c328a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dFz6DsaW7cS8rc7n4brz44vQ9hA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":915}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
