Yvette’s mother, Katherine, discourages her from embracing her Cree identity, so she explores it in secret. As she learns more about herself and her Indigenous heritage, Yvette finds a friend in Maggie Wolf, who embraces being part Mi’kmaq and encourages Yvette to be proud of being Cree. When her classmates learn about her Cree ancestry, Yvette encounters the realities of being Indigenous, facing prejudice with pride and holding fast to her dream of becoming a doctor. Café Daughter is inspired by true events and based on Kenneth T. Williams’ play of the same name.","popularity":0.6994,"poster_path":"/zPtIriElzUHUU4FxdSEz1YRjF0C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151136,"logo_path":"/yHu66t47DndzfFyxAnVjxsMuSIZ.png","name":"Circle Blue Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2023-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cree","iso_639_1":"cr","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Café Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2718337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Violah Beauvais","original_name":"Violah Beauvais","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":"/79kOailLDe6fX4vTmvk9HcdGQ1x.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Yvette Wong (9)","credit_id":"6488d3c9e375c0011c8196b2","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2559813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Star Slade","original_name":"Star Slade","popularity":0.1332,"profile_path":"/zA7AES22VAiYH0Ao5xGGAd99rvr.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Yvette Wong (16)","credit_id":"6488d401d2b20900ad3e4777","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1261887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sera-Lys McArthur","original_name":"Sera-Lys McArthur","popularity":0.0945,"profile_path":"/iztlKispp3G4FImLDLuiGz1YGkD.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Katherine Wong","credit_id":"6488d42c6f8d9500c88b6851","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3013607,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Lim","original_name":"Tom Lim","popularity":0.2711,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Charlie Wong","credit_id":"6488d41899259c00ff1096d4","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4110385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Lau","original_name":"Evan Lau","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Carl Wong (12)","credit_id":"6488d4576f8d95013c74a62a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4261257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Young","original_name":"Julian Young","popularity":0.0852,"profile_path":"/ysfrtPTwrulNOdkRAVqTYopIh30.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Carl Wong (18)","credit_id":"6682cef3ea2e3f46b670d8a8","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4110386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Demaris Moon Walker","original_name":"Demaris Moon Walker","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Maggie Wolf","credit_id":"6488d4a099259c011c42099e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Billy Merasty","original_name":"Billy Merasty","popularity":0.3084,"profile_path":"/udFrp3fQF4fUBTQXPr2pKDmDVlJ.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Amos Horseknife","credit_id":"6488d468bf31f2505f404dd0","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3479440,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Blair Lamora","original_name":"Blair Lamora","popularity":0.1675,"profile_path":"/5TdQ6zUtCTr9fqFAmZB0mfAWtFN.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Doris Horseknife","credit_id":"6682ce7b6812e3cc89b85a18","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1158255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dylan Cook","original_name":"Dylan Cook","popularity":0.1142,"profile_path":"/dI7B74K9a0lD9FwMGjCi55Hba8I.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Peter Horseknife","credit_id":"6682d1afc6d339e3811b77b5","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2984148,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edna Manitowabi","original_name":"Edna Manitowabi","popularity":0.1259,"profile_path":"/oXjZkC56WNqOagVVlBcozakF78H.jpg","cast_id":26,"character":"Kokum Mary","credit_id":"6682d1b84b03bddf169b0986","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":99181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanne Boland","original_name":"Joanne Boland","popularity":0.4968,"profile_path":"/wc2xDWNJmWYORfMQoMYXOUJoTfa.jpg","cast_id":27,"character":"Miss Scott","credit_id":"6682d1c0b177bb6b2b70d8de","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1825792,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Farquhar","original_name":"Chris Farquhar","popularity":0.0794,"profile_path":"/ok3daTfwqe9b8kQNGldC3CEtNlU.jpg","cast_id":28,"character":"Mr. Adams","credit_id":"6682d1c96b66ce513a0247eb","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4334632,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"William C.
