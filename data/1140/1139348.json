He would spend late nights buried in the computer screen, dreaming of building the greatest multiplayer game empire to rival World of Warcraft. When he retired, he took some of his own money and lots of others, including 75 million from the state of Rhode Island, to try and realize his dream.  Instead, his company, 38 Studios, ran through millions with little to show for it, ultimately collapsing into a mountain of debt. Through animation and interviews, the film tells us what happens when the aura of a legend overwhelms good sense.
