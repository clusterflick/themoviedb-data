For a while she is impartial but Arnold is too impetuous in his addresses and she repulses him. Gilbert Howell, a traveling salesman of the firm, puts into the vault a sealed package containing valuable private papers. On the same day is placed in the vault, a number of fine uncut stones in a similar package. When Howard starts on his usual tour, he takes from the vault what he thinks are his papers. That same evening, old St. Pierre, recalling the fact of leaving some very important papers on his desk is worried and decides to make sure by going back to the office alone to place them in the vault.","popularity":0.1329,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sealed Package","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Santschi","original_name":"Tom Santschi","popularity":0.2595,"profile_path":"/8TCS8pRx9LjfFXApYZZReYpTFpa.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gilbert Howell","credit_id":"6487503ce375c000acc68849","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3534036,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsie Greeson","original_name":"Elsie Greeson","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/rEUYrfJAQxCQO1X0F3g9fn6qT5I.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mildred St. Pierre","credit_id":"6487504ae375c00139c157db","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1148384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Franklyn Hall","original_name":"Franklyn Hall","popularity":0.0805,"profile_path":"/inqtAVuiTJ09VsngPCzKwxc7wy3.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Brian Godfrey","credit_id":"6487505b05822400ad7a37d1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1386380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julius Frankenburg","original_name":"Julius Frankenburg","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Arthur Lambert","credit_id":"6487506ec0348b00aed5747c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1108869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Watson","original_name":"Roy Watson","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":"/bRhCyQaIeKWLXVtS7OKvXMJfgxf.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Old St. Pierre - Mildred's Father","credit_id":"6487508499259c011c416095","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emma Bell Clifton","original_name":"Emma Bell Clifton","popularity":0.1228,"profile_path":"/6s6wkCvgZW8LP0E7AlJf91dgmbo.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6487508ebf31f25054b70d58","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1396902,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wallace Clifton","original_name":"Wallace Clifton","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6487502ad2b209014e0a505f","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Santschi","original_name":"Tom Santschi","popularity":0.2595,"profile_path":"/8TCS8pRx9LjfFXApYZZReYpTFpa.jpg","credit_id":"6487501de375c00139c157cb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0765196","wikidata_id":"Q20005949","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1914-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
