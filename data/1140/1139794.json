Fording the river takes time, with so many ox- and mule-drawn wagons and an unwieldy observation balloon to boot. This footage was shot by London-born Joseph Rosenthal for the Warwick Trading Company - one of many films he made during the conflict.","popularity":0.052,"poster_path":"/9GUtjuDodUzRbX8ikyMPfgPTo6W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19681,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warwick Trading Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1900-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A War Balloon and Transport Crossing the Vaal River","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4109492,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joseph Rosenthal","original_name":"Joseph Rosenthal","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64886102e2726001287b72ec","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2468002","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cAvfQlfo4kBqaa5nChpTlJwE9zc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9GUtjuDodUzRbX8ikyMPfgPTo6W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1900-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Boer War.
