Specifically, the consequences of cutting, inserting, and patching an image of a movement flow into itself. For material, I chose sequences of a Contact Improvisation duet between two dancers who had a great appetite for extended flow. My task was to devise real-time editing techniques that could re-create a sense of flow while disrupting an already flowing dance. Each study uses a different improvisational score for real-time editing actions. The technology was 3/4\" U-matic. While watching two monitor screens above me, I had to press the editing buttons (in and out) forcefully while standing up, making the activity a full-body interaction with my eyes.","popularity":0.0908,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Second Glances","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1691,"name":"dance"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
