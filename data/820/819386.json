The film is about two people who try to repress the slow but inevitable decay of their relationship. Feeling isolated in their own little home, more and more of the happy facade of their love life comes crumbling down. The profound melancholia of the subject is captured in little everyday moments that are intertwined with dreamlike sequences.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":"/6JNHwHaT4nS9fZJ3yG6cHVJSThQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeijay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3055771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Petra Stipetić","original_name":"Petra Stipetic","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607a2c747776f0005818b944","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3055772,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maren Wiese","original_name":"Maren Wiese","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607a2c8966f2d200291c1880","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6JNHwHaT4nS9fZJ3yG6cHVJSThQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
