Nevertheless, its relatively dark and heavy plot yields over-the-top expressions from the actors. There is little dialogue as the story opens: a mother is seen tending to her sick daughter, whom she is then told must be sacrificed to the forest. The viewers patiently but curiously watch the mother perform healing rituals with objects like egg shells, dried plants and twigs–also recurring in the installation–until the daughter mysteriously disappears.","popularity":0.3808,"poster_path":"/gfA5KXkB2v1blAx4OgcL6B1ri40.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152726,"logo_path":null,"name":"atelier john
