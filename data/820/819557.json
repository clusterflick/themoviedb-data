But it’s a dangerous thing to be led around by Cal, an irresponsible, frustratingly likable kid brother, enthusiastic to the point of irrationality to find Bigfoot for himself. For Cal, this is not a matter of legend. This is not just some adventure. If Samantha doesn’t stop him, Cal will either find Bigfoot or die trying.","popularity":2.2219,"poster_path":"/2p58pg4xgIzg4wp6ftw5NtSUym2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130834,"logo_path":null,"name":"MindInMotion","origin_country":""},{"id":65465,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cyfuno
