The catalyst for this film was the broadcasted portraits of figures such as Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, and the evident incongruity between the beguiling ordinariness of the images that represented them with the violent end we know they endured. Through a rare focus on portraiture, Akomfrah seeks to express the diversity of Black characters, characteristics and characterisations that should form the bedrock of any de-colonial or anti-racist future.","popularity":0.0956,"poster_path":"/uwHA0x22vnWqyghWiTkQ4ca9SZx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2021-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triptych","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Akomfrah","original_name":"John Akomfrah","popularity":0.1328,"profile_path":"/9ok6rVjT76dmzzNzCUhpjhiMsZA.jpg","credit_id":"607a19fd7776f0003f6466fe","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20565150","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1395,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uwHA0x22vnWqyghWiTkQ4ca9SZx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":930}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
