At the crossroads of trade routes, Palmyra attracted caravanners from Mesopotamia, India and China. In what remains of its ruins, rediscovered by Europeans in the 17th century, its numerous necropolises bear witness to a prosperous past. Carved in limestone in the first centuries of our era, the faces of the representatives - men, women and children - of its greatest families adorn the walls of its tombs. Since 2012, Danish archaeologist Rubina Raja has been leading a long-term project to find, document and retrace the family trees and daily life of these Palmyrenians.","popularity":0.3776,"poster_path":"/9Vyk3STbtOaUtJC7oAsY4zTVAqO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127305,"logo_path":null,"name":"Un Film à la Patte","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":141109,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ariane le Couteur & Agnes Trintzius","origin_country":""},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":13542,"logo_path":"/sJ0R9LDMGR5ildYS4GMhQcbKJVD.png","name":"CNRS Images","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 1001 Faces of Palmyra","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1498226,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Patrick Delage","original_name":"Patrick Delage","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"607ad3237a97ab00409f879c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1866649,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Caroline Vermalle","original_name":"Caroline Vermalle","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607ad2ca43d9b1006ea9d444","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2665420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meyar Al Roumi","original_name":"Meyar Al Roumi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yyPsmbG6E4VecS1UQR0X7uyIkQ2.jpg","credit_id":"607ad2a1031deb006ecb60bc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2665420,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Meyar Al Roumi","original_name":"Meyar Al Roumi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/yyPsmbG6E4VecS1UQR0X7uyIkQ2.jpg","credit_id":"607ad2ae43d9b1003fde2288","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2499143,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Agnès Trintzius","original_name":"Agnès Trintzius","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607ad2edaa659e0057eac121","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2716230,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aurine Crémieu","original_name":"Aurine Crémieu","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"607ad2bd031deb005998e1e9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9Vyk3STbtOaUtJC7oAsY4zTVAqO.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8LMitEEpLc4eFB6TVJhDNP6bfCK.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":184134,"name":"archeology"},{"id":191111,"name":"syria"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
