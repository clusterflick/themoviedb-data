Many still share it today as a meme when chatting without knowing that it was staged. Also: the young guy never uploaded the video himself. Powerless, he had to witness how it was shared and distorted countless times – how it destroyed a part of his life. Now, for the first time, Norman Kochanowski speaks with ZAPP about his story and the consequences of virality.","popularity":0.6541,"poster_path":"/9ZUTPFsA7EtFfOT31Lzso27VNx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ausgerastet und abgestürzt: Der Fall des Angry German Kid","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907492,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Kochanowski","original_name":"Norman Kochanowski","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63e00989ce5d8200cd90b9c2","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907495,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fritz Lüders","original_name":"Fritz Lüders","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e00a0e8741c40099b4ca13","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907495,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Fritz Lüders","original_name":"Fritz Lüders","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e00a1b373ac200cafddc06","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907496,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Uta Röttgers","original_name":"Uta Röttgers","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e00a2fcd20460079716e77","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907498,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Inga Mathwig","original_name":"Inga Mathwig","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e00a3c373ac200cafddc17","department":"Crew","job":"Editorial Staff"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907499,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vincent Brügel","original_name":"Vincent Brügel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e00a4fcd204600e20eef70","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1465459,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Claire Walka","original_name":"Claire Walka","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e00a5e23d27800b5e3c863","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/9ZUTPFsA7EtFfOT31Lzso27VNx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":41214,"name":"youtube"},{"id":194292,"name":"internet culture"},{"id":252104,"name":"2000s"},{"id":287619,"name":"youtuber"},{"id":300430,"name":"cyber bullying"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
