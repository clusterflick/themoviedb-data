The film focuses on some of the most beautiful and alarming paintings ever made in this country; pictures of aristocrats and prostitutes, coronations and killings, opera houses and music halls, and will evoke the long-lost atmosphere of Edwardian London. But above all it will show that from their two outposts in Chelsea and Camden, Sickert and Sargent were waging a war whose legacy still haunts us today.","popularity":0.0727,"poster_path":"/phnTV8B3wOaKJ8gCgG2ZQEQ8FDO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81680,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZCZ Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sickert vs Sargent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Waldemar Januszczak","original_name":"Waldemar Januszczak","popularity":0.2016,"profile_path":"/uiwR6ajxnLL7FSATFsUcerVxDe4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"63e191fa528b2e0085c5000c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Waldemar Januszczak","original_name":"Waldemar Januszczak","popularity":0.2016,"profile_path":"/uiwR6ajxnLL7FSATFsUcerVxDe4.jpg","credit_id":"63e19207528b2e00b5c39788","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1047014","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/phnTV8B3wOaKJ8gCgG2ZQEQ8FDO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
