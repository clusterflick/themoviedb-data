We follow them over the course of a year, through adolescence. We watch as they experience life in promiscuous Tel Aviv, in the religious ideology of a Jewish settlement and in the occupied city of Hebron, where Israeli soldiers are in control. One year of trials and tribulations of three sixteen year old boys. They try to fulfill their teenage dreams in an environment of violence and sometimes war.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/uLRKssqpGPwY0ZvFRr4EOabFB2S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3 Boys: Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3910706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raschel Blufarb","original_name":"Raschel Blufarb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e2e8788289a000c7602155","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190090,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brett Allen Smith","original_name":"Brett Allen Smith","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e2e885568463009242d5b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3910706,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raschel Blufarb","original_name":"Raschel Blufarb","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e2e893b39e3500a01c79c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7205902","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":818,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uLRKssqpGPwY0ZvFRr4EOabFB2S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":551}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"","release_date":"2017-12-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
