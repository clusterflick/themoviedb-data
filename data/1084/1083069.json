One light shines brighter and searches the city for a playmate. First, it visits an old man whose advanced years makes him an unsuitable playmate. It visits a child asleep in bed. Finally, the light discovers Little Baby Eyes at an abandoned gas station. They play together throughout the night. When the sun comes up, the light is gone, and Little Baby Eyes watches the sun rise.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Baby Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3907529,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicolaas Migliore","original_name":"Nicolaas Migliore","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/3uLGN3YulO7QLb9sFxh0yedFB6G.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Boy Asleep","credit_id":"63e01b39ffd44d007f14b264","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907551,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Thompson","original_name":"Dominique Thompson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Little Baby Eyes","credit_id":"63e01b61cd204600c30b3432","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daneeta Loretta Jackson","original_name":"Daneeta Loretta Jackson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e01c073a48c500ab1d05c2","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1530390,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Patrick Jackson","original_name":"Patrick Jackson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e01bdb3a48c5008fa9e40e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1530390,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Patrick Jackson","original_name":"Patrick Jackson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e01c26ffd44d00937ad4d0","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907553,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daneeta Loretta Jackson","original_name":"Daneeta Loretta Jackson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e01b96373ac20085d83ae6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1530390,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Patrick Jackson","original_name":"Patrick Jackson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e01c469974ee0b6b764314","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4718026","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
