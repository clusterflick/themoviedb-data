Papageno is the presenter, who accompanies the audience through the piece in an easily understandable, cheerful manner, and he experiences his adventures with the prince Tamino, who has fallen in love with Pamina, the daughter of the Queen of the Night, and yearns to liberate her from the kingdom of Sarastro, who has abducted her. However, until the happy ending of the piece, there are numerous hindrances to be overcome, such as wild beasts that bar Tamino's path, or Monostatos, who has also fallen in love with Pamina. And even if Papageno is in no mood for heroic deeds, his yearning for a \"girl or young woman\" is rewarded - and her name, of course, is Papagena.","popularity":0.1054,"poster_path":"/krduDPNK4DADCI9t3Kw0Wv7R853.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magic Flute for Children","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/krduDPNK4DADCI9t3Kw0Wv7R853.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2199,"name":"opera"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
