Seeking to learn why there has never been any Indian presence or awareness in their community, a white couple begins a journey that starts as a small discussion group in their home. As the regions' (and later the Nations') history of cruelty, racism, and ignorance toward Native Americans is told, the whites are deeply affected. Word begins circulating around the reservations that something unusual is happening among a group of whites and Indians. Curious whites hear about Indians traveling to their community, and start attending. What follows is an amazing story of changed hearts, friendships between enemies, and ultimately, astonishing community renewal and transformation.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/q01r8G5gR3YnOwo3p0U0ErgdxR9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192675,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greenleaf Street Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Native American Reconciliation","title":"Two Rivers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907524,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodney Mitchell","original_name":"Rodney Mitchell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e01665e559370083a55cc6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907524,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodney Mitchell","original_name":"Rodney Mitchell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e016813a48c500cad04e9b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3907527,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Diana Rico","original_name":"Diana Rico","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e016fa373ac20093cc5cc1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1564965","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.697,"height":1450,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/q01r8G5gR3YnOwo3p0U0ErgdxR9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1010}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"(A Native American Reconciliation)","key":"JaSLbvnMy0E","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-01-09T16:25:26.000Z","id":"63e017e5ffd44d00c3bfb1ce"}]}}}
