He has yet to register her birth, because he wants her birth certificate to be the same as the other kids, which is to have a mother and father. In order to do so, he offers a deal to a woman from Vietnam: he will pay her 20 million won to put her name on a marriage certificate as his wife and Ye Na's birth certificate as her mother. She declines the offer and Man Sik becomes devastated. Mi Hee then appears.","popularity":0.3779,"poster_path":"/aEpznS3EozvBL2OIcMJgbstxAJZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154810,"logo_path":"/ptFmUmvS7aANRcmajNW249FGPMu.png","name":"KBS","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2016-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer Dream","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","title":"Deurama Seupesyeol Shijeun 7 - Han Yeoreumeui Ggum , Drama Special Season 7: A Midsummer Night's Dream , 드라마 스페셜 시즌 7 - 한 여름의 꿈 , One Summer Dream","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550683,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Hee-won","original_name":"김희원","popularity":0.5675,"profile_path":"/sDCxskfmmNidOjV2LwsWh9dAVbN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hwang Man Shik","credit_id":"63e178a5ae281100a0294852","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1311205,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Ga-eun","original_name":"김가은","popularity":0.6434,"profile_path":"/x5xv6LcBvMWj5sGFDs5mOkFXwow.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jang Mi Hee","credit_id":"63e178d0e9c0dc00de6b59dd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2278760,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Bo-min","original_name":"Kim Bo-min","popularity":0.2752,"profile_path":"/wEFFe7cLu7LOBeKd7wcG0IhrNuV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Hwang Ye Na","credit_id":"63e178e71f0275007b650127","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1661283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Park Hye-jin","original_name":"박혜진","popularity":0.1818,"profile_path":"/5cM51cww0P6CVNCRt3BQrGERBfc.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Kim Soon Jung","credit_id":"63e17918e9c0dc00de6b59ef","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3908959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jo Woong","original_name":"Jo Woong","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e17968c5c1ef048efedce3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3908960,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Son Se Rin","original_name":"Son Se Rin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e179793679a1009d306f7b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.737,"height":1158,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aEpznS3EozvBL2OIcMJgbstxAJZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":854}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ko","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
