However, it was not until the groundbreaking Hail the New Puritan in 1986, that the relationship between the two artists was deeply cemented. Originally commissioned as an arts documentary by Channel 4 of the BBC, Hail the New Puritan turned the genre on its head, presenting a highly stylized and fictionalized version of a typical day in Clark’s life – an “anti-documentary”, as Atlas has called it.  The two artists also worked closely together on another Channel 4 production, Because We Must (1989), which was full of extreme theatricality in its dance, choreography, scenery, costumes, and directorial position.","popularity":0.0784,"poster_path":"/wluO661aBBQmDeTDeadC6qID1DN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Prune Twin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109747,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Atlas","original_name":"Charles Atlas","popularity":0.1178,"profile_path":"/dlYNDRuv0iInZxbFxvVTC7UUsbv.jpg","credit_id":"63e1b23b7776f000bce65d93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1329,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wluO661aBBQmDeTDeadC6qID1DN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":886}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
