Ulanoff, a widely decorated military historian who served with the Counterintelligence Corps in Europe during World War II, introduces this gripping documentary film. At 7:55 AM on Sunday, December 7th, 1941, which FDR called \"a date which will live in infamy,\" the Japanese began an air attack that devastated the Pacific fleet and took the lives of 2,343 servicemen. Lt. Cmdr. John Ford skillfully blends historic action with studio shots in this Oscar-winning look at the day's events. Also included is The Fleet That Came to Stay, concerning the invasion of Okinawa.","popularity":0.129,"poster_path":"/mcuYplknhyRY1tuNUWy88uW3uS7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117151,"logo_path":null,"name":"GoodTimes Home Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"See the Events That Brought Us into the War...","title":"December 7th / The Fleet That Came To Stay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":2458,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/mcuYplknhyRY1tuNUWy88uW3uS7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Part of Pearl Harbor 4 Pack boxed set","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
