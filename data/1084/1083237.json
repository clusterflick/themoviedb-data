The audience is invited to understand the filmmaker as a subject co-produced by their location, as well as consider the ways the land is co-produced by those on it. The place itself is a character in the film, as are the filmmaker's methods. The film is composed of multiple media: 16mm film, HD video, infrared stills, inter-titles, and sound recordings. The result is a feminist ethnographic landscape film that communicates both the majesty of 1800s landscape photography and the violence of a settler colonial gaze that is its context.","popularity":0.1939,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Inside of Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2443916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Basquin","original_name":"Bill Basquin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e0a7a823d27800852d494a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2443916,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Basquin","original_name":"Bill Basquin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63e0a7919974ee0b63f33a1f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7391450","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1890,"name":"camping"},{"id":156388,"name":"environmentalism"},{"id":232116,"name":"wolves"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-02-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
