Also included are Target Tokyo, a 1945 documentary narrated by Ronald Reagan, which follows the first bombing raid on Tokyo by B-29 Superfortresses, and another World War II short film, Air War Against Japan.  Appointment in Tokyo: Featuring enemy film taken from captured Japanese newsreels, this 1945 documentary depicts MacArthur's long struggle to fight his way back to the Philippines, after his enf-rced evacuation, and beyond to Japan. From Australia, he cut through the jungle of New Guinea and up the stairway of islands, making good on his promise to return, as Adm. Chester Nimitz went from Hawaii through the Gilberts, Marshalls, and Marianas.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":"/xzk1JIPnMKFoOyatGE9la4uYbax.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117151,"logo_path":null,"name":"GoodTimes Home Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pearl Harbor Payback/ Appointment In Tokyo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":2458,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xzk1JIPnMKFoOyatGE9la4uYbax.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1728}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Part of Pearl Harbor 4 Pack boxed set.","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
