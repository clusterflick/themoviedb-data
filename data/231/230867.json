John Berger begins Taşkafa’s story, reading from his novel, King, the story of the disappearance of a community told from a dog’s perspective. The area’s ordinary people – taxi drivers, shopkeepers, street traders – care deeply about the welfare of the city’s street dogs and they tell us stories about Taşkafa and their other canine neighbours. The animals are a symbol of community living, where people (and dogs) look out for each other, but this is a community in transition; one from which dogs are starting to be expelled. Eccentric, amusing and very warm, the film is a powerful indictment of the impact of global politics and the economic appropriation of public space but, even more, it is a tribute to both the spirit of resistance and to city life that can accommodate people and dogs together.","popularity":0.1195,"poster_path":"/lBLmyycslRhy0XH9ToPoTS0Lw2v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taşkafa, Stories of the Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Taşkafa, Stories from the Street","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":235016,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Berger","original_name":"John Berger","popularity":0.0942,"profile_path":"/m8pMStl7CAsjVvDYdcCNJyxalab.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"59a86ca092514157a501b477","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1266175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Luka Zimmerman","original_name":"Andrea Luka Zimmerman","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/eGWl81TL9yhfYHUA3ZSiWvQCwOw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272b91","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1266175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrea Luka Zimmerman","original_name":"Andrea Luka Zimmerman","popularity":0.0193,"profile_path":"/eGWl81TL9yhfYHUA3ZSiWvQCwOw.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272b97","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266177,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gulen Guler","original_name":"Gulen Guler","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272b9d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266178,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bill McAlister","original_name":"Bill McAlister","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272ba3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2860362","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.781,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jQnVUTmAHPAUOmUplwnTloBPram.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1282}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":755,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/lBLmyycslRhy0XH9ToPoTS0Lw2v.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":510}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
