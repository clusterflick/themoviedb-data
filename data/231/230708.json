Who's that guy bringing us dinner to go with a SuperBowl or Champion's League soccer game on TV or the latest Blu-ray blockbuster? In FOUR SEASONS, such a guy is Mario, a film geek, love addict and college drop-out with a less-than-impressive resume, who's facing an identity crisis at the end of his twenties while living with his grandpa. Mario delivers pizzas. He's one of the many surviving off his tips by working at Pizzicato, a pizza shop owned by one nasty, sleazy boss and the kind of place you would only dare order food from at gun-point.","popularity":0.2572,"poster_path":"/g5wJnnKzhzmv8ytSlO5A5KhGuNP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5085,"logo_path":"/mPuVc7m1Ki7OQQvAYwYfIlEI3vu.png","name":"TV3","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":51162,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sagrera Audiovisuals","origin_country":""},{"id":51163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Somnia Art / RTVV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2010-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Seasons","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":45060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leticia Dolera","original_name":"Leticia Dolera","popularity":0.2824,"profile_path":"/rzWekaXWoC9HKIZkOf7hddQDtFI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Mariona","credit_id":"52fe4ddcc3a36847f8271a2b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1017209,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carles Torrens","original_name":"Carles Torrens","popularity":0.2158,"profile_path":"/jBGDX4BwsytGhPehgrrPKFFlIgn.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddcc3a36847f8271a2f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iván Morales","original_name":"Iván Morales","popularity":0.1228,"profile_path":"/3DlwJPbJDd35G4CYhkmWhYbNcnq.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddcc3a36847f8271a33","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1265883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francesc Tormos","original_name":"Francesc Tormos","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddcc3a36847f8271a37","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190349,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Prat","original_name":"Albert Prat","popularity":0.061,"profile_path":"/kjmNSfIf75zKVYULfAmNO6SHv3i.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ddcc3a36847f8271a3b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1149067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Verdaguer","original_name":"David Verdaguer","popularity":0.2811,"profile_path":"/6TreWuZXVK9qYoHC0qLSbnHA1e0.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mario","credit_id":"554bad8392514146940023ea","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Barrena","original_name":"Marcel Barrena","popularity":0.2205,"profile_path":"/eyfiuD3kDOfShAg6hCgQjUV071B.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"64bbfc09ac6c7908db5b3baf","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Barrena","original_name":"Marcel Barrena","popularity":0.2205,"profile_path":"/eyfiuD3kDOfShAg6hCgQjUV071B.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ddcc3a36847f8271a41","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1152634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marcel Barrena","original_name":"Marcel Barrena","popularity":0.2205,"profile_path":"/eyfiuD3kDOfShAg6hCgQjUV071B.jpg","credit_id":"64bbfc04eb79c200ff9ca92f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1748428,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Óscar Montesinos","original_name":"Óscar Montesinos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64bbfc45eb79c200c5d996db","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1393011","wikidata_id":"Q5793392","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g5wJnnKzhzmv8ytSlO5A5KhGuNP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
