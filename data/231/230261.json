Major productions like these often need masses of extras—and the local people are all too willing to be part of a Hollywood production, even though they might never get to see the result on-screen.  Ouarzazate Movie shows all too clearly that behind the scenes nothing survives of the film world’s glamor and glitter. Now, those famous blockbusters leave a bitter aftertaste. The outside may sparkle, but on the inside Western imperialism still reigns supreme.","popularity":0.1399,"poster_path":"/jtyRqdHKay1be1RCPvMbByrgZiq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22945,"logo_path":"/zRDp1tYw2I5DtyHcAJHiBx6Xaii.png","name":"Quark Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ouarzazate Movie","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1265195,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Essafi","original_name":"Ali Essafi","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dd3c3a36847f826fb83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1958328,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Isabelle Fermon","original_name":"Isabelle Fermon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd49b00929f6017e9a4719","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1859894,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Patrick Winocour","original_name":"Patrick Winocour","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd49d00929f6016499b22d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1502612,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alberto Yaccelini","original_name":"Alberto Yaccelini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd49c4197de401861633a1","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1859893,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Juliette Guigon","original_name":"Juliette Guigon","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65fd49dd1b1f3c017c972720","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3384936","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jtyRqdHKay1be1RCPvMbByrgZiq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
