Hung and her scheming mother engage a sorcerer, Ko Yin Yau, to place a spell on him. Yuk Lung becomes possessed by the Adultery Ghost, and he leaves Pai Lin in the middle of having sex with her, going to Hung. Pai Lin and her friend Nancy rush to Thailand, seeking the help of another sorcerer, Simol. The title alludes to the battle of the two spell-casters, through their two hosts. Along the way, plenty of excuses are found to get all the clothes off a number of lovely young women.","popularity":1.681,"poster_path":"/1TJ9UokiBmtKskNAo5Z6IlGEEHY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129981,"logo_path":null,"name":"香港泰吉影业有限公司","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1991-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Witchcraft vs. Curse","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"Se jiang","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"茅山鬥降頭","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Witchcraft Vs Curse","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","title":"茅山斗降头","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":228106,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tsang Siu-Yin","original_name":"Tsang Siu-Yin","popularity":0.2176,"profile_path":"/uw4fiZhrkUJ4NYU7K2HB9Lxzxj0.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Pai Lin","credit_id":"59f242d1c3a3680682038bd5","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1266032,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ng Gong","original_name":"Ng Gong","popularity":0.2044,"profile_path":"/oSqLJxPGHqkFXWlwif8snbc5c8u.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Fu Yuk Lung","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272c61","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1266033,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yim Hung Chung","original_name":"Yim Hung Chung","popularity":0.1302,"profile_path":"/n1AXLPAcpCrpsLgKAYvNkgBbjsA.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Yip Hung","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272c65","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":26740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lindzay Chan","original_name":"Lindzay Chan","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Chi Chuen","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272c69","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":62426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michiko Nishiwaki","original_name":"西脇美智子","popularity":0.9695,"profile_path":"/aToxF8fTOLUmFL5iXlVYXGI2HlA.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Simol","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272c6d","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1140550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yeung Chak-Lam","original_name":"Yeung Chak-Lam","popularity":0.5473,"profile_path":"/1Q8Nw9kGSpalVTJgcq9dftZ0yGp.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Ku Tin Yau","credit_id":"67d93cf2c0566a100a088b06","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fong Yau","original_name":"Fong Yau","popularity":0.1531,"profile_path":"/qIXTchCpUQi90lC6eelLKSJBkVX.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272c77","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hoh Tin-Shing","original_name":"Hoh Tin-Shing","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":"/9M0F1mMHdDlQbKa6z6DaUlWCEbP.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272c7d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83678,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fong Yau","original_name":"Fong Yau","popularity":0.1531,"profile_path":"/qIXTchCpUQi90lC6eelLKSJBkVX.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272c83","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1109253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hoh Tin-Shing","original_name":"Hoh Tin-Shing","popularity":0.0544,"profile_path":"/9M0F1mMHdDlQbKa6z6DaUlWCEbP.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272c89","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1092381,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tang Siu-Lam","original_name":"鄧少林","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63badbdffc31d30092c4dd08","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1817541,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Chang Hua","original_name":"Chang Hua","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63badc0cc0a308009343b826","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0121725","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ak92sir46uE8ncp0JiOxOa0ZoiR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1TJ9UokiBmtKskNAo5Z6IlGEEHY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"III","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"cn","note":"","release_date":"1991-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
