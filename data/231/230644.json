Newly reborn as a Songstress, 16-year-old Bellin Ajelli sets off a holy pilgrimage across the planet. Rumors of a possible terrorist attack result in Prince Truhallon of the militant Donau Empire being sent in to protect her, but his very presence is the antithesis of everything Bellin stands for. The two are as different as night and day, but they're stuck together until they reach the capital.","popularity":0.9134,"poster_path":"/gRjDkN42XSDX61KcYW6XgSzq8Er.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2012-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"GOTHICMADE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"Gotikkumêdo: Hana no utame","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"THE FIVE STAR STORIES Special Limited Edition Tokuten - Hana no Utame GOTHICMADE Tokuhou & Yokokuhen","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103505,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Kawamura","original_name":"川村万梨阿","popularity":0.6156,"profile_path":"/sCDzOxzbfAYTGarArpbxDexSWb8.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Berin","credit_id":"57dc7456c3a3682307000a26","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nozomu Sasaki","original_name":"佐々木望","popularity":1.096,"profile_path":"/7usoPlvc9Xa1rDA2vxmVi0OvLDb.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Donau","credit_id":"57dc7498c3a36863a0001a0e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":81860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ai Orikasa","original_name":"折笠愛","popularity":0.9257,"profile_path":"/6ztt20jMc4oprKbixp2sNrR2ykK.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Adem","credit_id":"57dc74d9c3a368227f000a69","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":73044,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ikue Otani","original_name":"大谷育江","popularity":0.9942,"profile_path":"/my8LBLQ4MsK4hRz1PAATIqtieaI.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Love","credit_id":"57dc74f3c3a3682248000a1f","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1449835,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mamoru Nagano","original_name":"Mamoru Nagano","popularity":0.0679,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65a38fe07d5f4b00bfb7d6f8","department":"Writing","job":"Original Film Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1449835,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mamoru Nagano","original_name":"Mamoru Nagano","popularity":0.0679,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57dc714fc3a36863840017d4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1449835,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mamoru Nagano","original_name":"Mamoru Nagano","popularity":0.0679,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57dc7176c3a368639c001827","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1449835,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mamoru Nagano","original_name":"Mamoru Nagano","popularity":0.0679,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57dc718ec3a36863840017e8","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":930150,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Seikou Nagaoka","original_name":"Seikou Nagaoka","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57dc7539c3a36863840018d1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1449835,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mamoru Nagano","original_name":"Mamoru Nagano","popularity":0.0679,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66f88bc1621e8616b45f4f8b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3427147,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Yoshihiro Sakaguchi","original_name":"坂口由洋","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67cf414d05da1a9e15e2eb24","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3835438","wikidata_id":"Q2268177","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":1112,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/gRjDkN42XSDX61KcYW6XgSzq8Er.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":780},{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/heuvrVPvT9C3wJJoYh3ANi66nVJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":723}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
