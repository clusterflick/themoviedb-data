Harvey plays Ann Garden, an unemployed actress who ends up in night court on a loitering charge. Here she meets Gil Taylor (Willy Fritsch), a struggling songwriter temporarily employed as a court reporter. Hoping to keep her out of jail, Gil impulsively tells the judge that he's engaged to Ann -- whereupon the judge, equally impulsively, marries the couple on the spot! After this inauspicious start, Ann and Gil embark upon a rocky (but tuneful) whirlwind romance.","popularity":0.4965,"poster_path":"/o8RRoEWtVU6PO9eYyaGahJ8m1hG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12372,"logo_path":"/lcQScIQXHQXuLMLFQt0loJl5gWJ.png","name":"UFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1936-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lucky Kids","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"CHILDREN OF FORTUNE","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Willy Fritsch","original_name":"Willy Fritsch","popularity":0.1709,"profile_path":"/7MKVQWgy8VncbRxF249WimBxfxm.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gil Taylor, Reporter","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272a3f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lilian Harvey","original_name":"Lilian Harvey","popularity":0.1596,"profile_path":"/hkEO3LYFOgu7tGVQLzc5ZpbV0w1.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ann Garden","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272a43","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28073,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oskar Sima","original_name":"Oskar Sima","popularity":0.2405,"profile_path":"/bQDZxEXLpQ2voIxflksqYzTF8uV.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Stoddard, Reporter","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272a4b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46704,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Albert Florath","original_name":"Albert Florath","popularity":0.2963,"profile_path":"/ciYf1a97dXw3J3RnTpH0nPajPYk.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Ölmagnat Mr. Jackson","credit_id":"534ec09bc3a36867820017b3","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14126,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Bildt","original_name":"Paul Bildt","popularity":0.1331,"profile_path":"/oiYGNyzxYJoPcEAH6AjCowrtoPl.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Schnellrichter","credit_id":"534ec0abc3a36867820017b5","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":219738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Kemp","original_name":"Paul Kemp","popularity":0.1188,"profile_path":"/npi51Hq2RF19WZlVoXyivU092Qx.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Frank Black, Reporter","credit_id":"536d426dc3a368124a00bed1","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1531728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Goebel","original_name":"Fred Goebel","popularity":0.0874,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Bill","credit_id":"59ed96df925141245f01d67d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28132,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erich Kestin","original_name":"Erich Kestin","popularity":0.0694,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Hopkins","credit_id":"59ed96e99251413db90097ab","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48204,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Stoeckel","original_name":"Otto Stoeckel","popularity":0.1229,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Chefredakteur Manning","credit_id":"59ed96f3925141278301cbee","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Hiller","original_name":"Max Hiller","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Standesbeamter","credit_id":"59ed971fc3a36871bc01ed50","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":591054,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hermann Mayer-Falkow","original_name":"Hermann Mayer-Falkow","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":21,"character":"Schallterbeamter beim Morning Post","credit_id":"5a0a3e7892514130e200c8a2","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":161260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Martin","original_name":"Paul Martin","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272a2f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":161260,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Martin","original_name":"Paul Martin","popularity":0.0589,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272a35","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89811,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Curt Goetz","original_name":"Curt Goetz","popularity":0.0918,"profile_path":"/AeCuEDDwi9jFPAxo5SX57WveaWK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272a3b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37899,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert A.
