Nienke's mission: to pluck Liz Burch from obscurity and give her a starring role in her debut film! This coming-of-age-story deals with the appeal of a character in a TV drama to a young lesbian and the excitement of meeting your childhood idol. But it's also about the pain of growing up, and what happens when fantasy and reality coincide. With animation, blue-screen, archive material and clever editing between Flying Doctors episodes and real life, the film pushes the boundaries of reality and fiction. Fan is a cheerful, poignant and fascinating self-portrait full of self-depreciating humor.","popularity":0.125,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1215129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liz Burch","original_name":"Liz Burch","popularity":0.3734,"profile_path":"/tyvAGWCs8tQN5UfXFVbAFWcWL2y.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"herself","credit_id":"52fe4dd2c3a36847f826fa4f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1265185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nienke Eijsink","original_name":"Nienke Eijsink","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"herself","credit_id":"52fe4dd2c3a36847f826fa53","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1265185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nienke Eijsink","original_name":"Nienke Eijsink","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dd2c3a36847f826fa4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1642199","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-09-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
