Inside, an ominous ringmaster forces his prized act, a real live mermaid to perform for a group of grimy, working class spectators. The mermaid, though frightening, is but a lovesick, caged animal praying for release from her endless torture. Unwilling to surrender his meal ticket, the ringmaster rejects her pleas for compassion and continues to confine the mermaid to her stagnant holding tank. With nowhere to escape to, the mermaid must make the choice between holding on to the hope of freedom and putting an end to her abuse. Produced by Samantha Jewell, Lindsey Mann, Justin Simon and Aliya Tarmo through the VFS Compendium series and Directed by Nicholas Humphries (Riese: Kingdom Falling), The Little Mermaid is a twisted re-imagining of the classic Hans Christian Anderson tale.","popularity":0.1345,"poster_path":"/kLuuqhc7Ji4cLZlazrYTatgLA5G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34211,"logo_path":"/1LJMQNTNMtwwNJSGE8qJ2qTbWl3.png","name":"Vancouver Film School","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Little Mermaid","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37695,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jovanna Huguet","original_name":"Jovanna Huguet","popularity":0.3037,"profile_path":"/4i3uTE0VtXpA2aIBJyQ43YNqFnP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mermaid","credit_id":"5a56ea5fc3a3685ee602e383","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231083,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trevor Gemma","original_name":"Trevor Gemma","popularity":0.0894,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Grigori","credit_id":"5a56eaa69251417aa603066d","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197196,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nicholas Humphries","original_name":"Nicholas Humphries","popularity":0.0981,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dd7c3a36847f8270bd9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1943254,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Meagan Hotz","original_name":"Meagan Hotz","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a56eb0f9251417aa902ee08","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2062673","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.647,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kLuuqhc7Ji4cLZlazrYTatgLA5G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":647}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-10-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
