But her quiet, well-ordered life spins out of control when she has to hide her mysteriously fascinating Polish neighbor Jola – who believes to have accidentally killed someone. Dora is hesitant at first to take her in, but she cannot seem to shake her fascination with Jola. Dora's trust in the direct, impulsive woman grows – Jola seems to ask exactly those questions no one else dares to ask. When Dora finds out that the accusations against Jola have been lifted, she lies about the status of the police investigation in order to keep her Polish neighbor for herself.","popularity":0.1989,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":56362,"logo_path":null,"name":"Junifilm","origin_country":""},{"id":1946,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eikon Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nachbarinnen","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Nachbarinnen (2004)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Nachbarinnen","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Wanted!","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Procura-se!","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les voisines","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","title":"Sasiadki","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1384,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Grażyna Szapołowska","original_name":"Grażyna Szapołowska","popularity":0.2843,"profile_path":"/pjI5gFihRcpee7nWJs2CFPIrQgZ.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Jola","credit_id":"52fe4ddbc3a36847f827186b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":13805,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dagmar Manzel","original_name":"Dagmar Manzel","popularity":0.1865,"profile_path":"/eCG8xLUcMbmnYJUXBRnUCldw1zf.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Dora","credit_id":"52fe4ddbc3a36847f827186f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jörg Schüttauf","original_name":"Jörg Schüttauf","popularity":0.1772,"profile_path":"/fxQYG2JbWTZv2HRKo7GWl7xaOlH.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Conny","credit_id":"5ad7c9759251413cd0004ce1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":223773,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramona Kunze-Libnow","original_name":"Ramona Kunze-Libnow","popularity":0.189,"profile_path":"/lGIzW0mn3eJUr9Nf6yUoZvT4ISn.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Gabi","credit_id":"5ad7c9819251413ccd004861","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kirsten Block","original_name":"Kirsten Block","popularity":0.3165,"profile_path":"/e1gl6JMgedhLKVh1THHpVaevQ8V.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Polizistin","credit_id":"5ad7c98dc3a3687193004fec","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8202,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthias Brenner","original_name":"Matthias Brenner","popularity":0.2159,"profile_path":"/m28WGfLmVUeeDmxmrWjD0JgVOd8.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Polizist","credit_id":"5ad7c9c39251413cd0004d2a","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":27500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marylu Poolman","original_name":"Marylu Poolman","popularity":0.136,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Rosa Zimmer","credit_id":"5ad7c9d4c3a368719c004c0c","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51193,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franziska Meletzky","original_name":"Franziska Meletzky","popularity":0.116,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ddbc3a36847f8271867","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":51194,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Elke Rössler","original_name":"Elke Rössler","popularity":0.1269,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3d1abbe295b40032a103d6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2720297,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Niklas Bäumer","original_name":"Niklas Bäumer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3d1b228dbc330036ac599a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1866155,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ernst Ludwig Ganzert","original_name":"Ernst Ludwig Ganzert","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3d1b43bb10570033f78197","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1134833,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Anke Hartwig","original_name":"Anke Hartwig","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f3d1b7ead59b500361bfde9","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0366808","wikidata_id":"Q59509723","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":9833,"name":"lesbian relationship"},{"id":264386,"name":"lesbian"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2005-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
