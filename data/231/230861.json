Irish-born Eliza Lynch, lifetime partner of dictator Francisco Solano López, was painted by Brazil as a puppet master, thief and whore, and in 1991 included alongside Lucretia Borgia and Catherine the Great in a book entitled The World’s Wickedest Women. In Paraguay, the country where she lived as a beloved uncrowned queen, she is a national heroine. Fascinated by the contradiction, Irish academics Michael Lillis and Ronan Fanning embarked on 18 years of research to write a biography which forms the basis of Alan Gilsenan’s unique and compassionate documentary. Blending interviews with re-enactments of Eliza’s life – wonderfully performed by actress Maria Doyle – Gilsenan thoughtfully breathes humanity into a portrait of a much maligned woman.","popularity":0.3327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":57402,"logo_path":null,"name":"COCO Television","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2013-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eliza Lynch: Queen of Paraguay","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":33394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Doyle Kennedy","original_name":"Maria Doyle Kennedy","popularity":1.0247,"profile_path":"/dlZ5METJ8AKFjjlA6tjQiA9yfK3.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272a9f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266009,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leryn Franco","original_name":"Leryn Franco","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272aa3","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266008,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stuart Switzer","original_name":"Stuart Switzer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272a9b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1039913,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Gilsenan","original_name":"Alan Gilsenan","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272a8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1039913,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Gilsenan","original_name":"Alan Gilsenan","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272a95","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3171758","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Eliza Lynch: Queen of Paraguay (2013) Documentary Trailer","key":"v3E8hClrSAg","published_at":"2013-10-16T18:31:53.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec720c3a368544800b62d"}]}}}
