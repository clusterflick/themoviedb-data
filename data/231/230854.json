It is, in effect, the local old people’s home, but it also serves as a refuge for others ‘who have lost everything’. The inhabitants (or ‘exhibits’ – since most castles house art galleries) range from an athletic old man in a speedy wheelchair to a philosopher with a taste for neologisms, a lawyer known as ‘the Classic’, a woman who has seen aliens, and the taciturn Liduška, who collects pigeon feathers. Director Pavol Korec has compiled an attractive mosaic of characters who, despite past tragedies, exhibit an enthusiasm for life whatever the constraints. Intelligent use of image and music lift this above the conventional documentary record. Unusual, affectionate, and subtle, the film provides a light-hearted testament and commitment to life as a value independent of neo-capitalist convention.","popularity":0.0413,"poster_path":"/1gf7R3TtbPyBcoRredVyou8Ftxp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2013-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exhibits or Stories from the Castle","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266000,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jozef Kulačik","original_name":"Jozef Kulačik","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de1c3a36847f82729d7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265997,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paľo Korec","original_name":"Pavol Korec","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de1c3a36847f82729bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1265998,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zuzana Balkóová","original_name":"Zuzana Balkóová","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de1c3a36847f82729c5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1265999,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Judita Gembická","original_name":"Judita Gembická","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de1c3a36847f82729cb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1265997,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paľo Korec","original_name":"Pavol Korec","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de1c3a36847f82729d1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3270820","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":953,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1gf7R3TtbPyBcoRredVyou8Ftxp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":673}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
