Herself an immigrant to the area, Guo’s sensitive character studies hint at an affinity with the push and pull of feelings of alienation, a theme she has previously explored as a filmmaker (She a Chinese, LFF 2009) and novelist (A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers). This empathy is also apparent in her playful stylistic approach that layers Warhol-esque news reports, archival material and a soundtrack including Linton Kwesi Johnson and Fela Kuti, to comment on the human cost of capitalism. The resulting film is both a penetrating portrait of a frenetic place that feels deeply authentic, and a powerful piece of protest film.","popularity":0.0927,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":17508,"logo_path":null,"name":"Perspective Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2013-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Late at Night: Voices of Ordinary Madness","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":434091,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Xiaolu Guo","original_name":"Xiaolu Guo","popularity":0.0702,"profile_path":"/uPOpGcUqzy58HwTSHv8d2SF36Dk.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272ab3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":434091,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Xiaolu Guo","original_name":"Xiaolu Guo","popularity":0.0702,"profile_path":"/uPOpGcUqzy58HwTSHv8d2SF36Dk.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272ab9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266010,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Philippe Ciompi","original_name":"Philippe Ciompi","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272abf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":434091,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Xiaolu Guo","original_name":"Xiaolu Guo","popularity":0.0702,"profile_path":"/uPOpGcUqzy58HwTSHv8d2SF36Dk.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de2c3a36847f8272ac5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3164186","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"LATE AT NIGHT - VOICES OF ORDINARY MADNESS - XIAOLU GUO - TRAILER","key":"tiBrbkUWZuE","published_at":"2013-09-29T12:44:30.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec720c3a368544800b62e"}]}}}
