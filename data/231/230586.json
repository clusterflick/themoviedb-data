Most of the Kosovo Serbs have been ethnically cleansed by the Albanians who make up the majority of Kosovo. Kosovo has been under UN administration since 1999 when NATO bombed Serbia for 76 days to halt a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatism in its province of Kosovo. In the years following the war, thousands of Serbs were expelled from their homes, kidnapped and killed. Their houses, cultural and religious sites were burned and destroyed. Kosovo for the Serbs is what Jerusalem is for the Jewish people. It is the cradle of their statehood, culture and religion. Most of the important Serbian Christian Orthodox monasteries are in Kosovo. Today, Serbs still have a deep spiritual and traditional connection to Kosovo, a land which is being cleansed of everything Serbian.","popularity":0.0741,"poster_path":"/3FwmSOOKCSUR6Ypcx4W2xVOLtiJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97516,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malagurski Cinema","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kosovo: Can You Imagine?","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Malagurski","original_name":"Boris Malagurski","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/lJbfvAC7uX4uglrORv8ZikqQnUv.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ddac3a36847f8271389","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1211732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Boris Malagurski","original_name":"Boris Malagurski","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":"/lJbfvAC7uX4uglrORv8ZikqQnUv.jpg","credit_id":"5e8246438c22c000133433c3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1382271","wikidata_id":"Q1631979","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1301,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/3FwmSOOKCSUR6Ypcx4W2xVOLtiJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":868},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1707,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/f7C18MePWaHEBgIvyc7WKD0HqkR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1138}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
