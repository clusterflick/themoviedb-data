A notorious London theatre and film impresario, he produced over 300 shows and movies over the last 50 years. Bringing to the stage the risqué productions of Oh! Calcutta!, The Rocky Horror Show and to the screen Monty Python’s The Holy Grail, as well as introducing Merce Cunningham, Pina Bausch and Yoko Ono to London audiences, he irrevocably shaped the cultural scene of the 1970s London. Playboy, gambler, bon vivant, friend of the rich and famous, he is now in his eighties and still enjoys partying like there’s no tomorrow. In this intimate documentary, filmmaker Gracie Otto introduces us to this larger-than-life phenomenon. Featuring interviews with 50 of his closest friends including Anna Wintour, Kate Moss, John Waters and Barry Humphries and, of course, the man himself, Otto pays a vibrant tribute to a fascinating entertainer.","popularity":0.1285,"poster_path":"/jaiFC6IfGRL1cEwB1FQzy1WNKdP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2013-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Impresario","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":213098,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gracie Otto","original_name":"Gracie Otto","popularity":0.2126,"profile_path":"/l8Q1tPES0VJUc4sYXiF5GGaY8he.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4de1c3a36847f827291d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1034189,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nicole O'Donohue","original_name":"Nicole O'Donohue","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de1c3a36847f8272923","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3164244","wikidata_id":"Q17009513","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1440,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jaiFC6IfGRL1cEwB1FQzy1WNKdP.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":960},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rmqz6EgvrFsqUWaJM7rIm8tAiFM.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187056,"name":"woman director"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Last Impressario Trailer","key":"388IqbSRw7o","published_at":"2014-09-19T06:10:26.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"5485e9f7c3a36867d50022cd"}]}}}
