The words of her teacher are a gentle invitation to express herself. But Vashti can’t draw - she’s no artist. To prove her point, Vashti jabs at a blank sheet of paper to make an unremarkable and angry mark. \"There!\" she says.  That one little dot marks the beginning of Vashti’s journey of surprise and self-discovery. That special moment is the core of Peter H. Reynolds’s delicate fable about the creative spirit in all of us.","popularity":0.4295,"poster_path":"/dsZu5Nesj4jhrM0hNepfPKcqwiv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13636,"logo_path":"/qTvhJHw5ixJX9t0cR81cF4eVvfO.png","name":"Weston Woods Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1938,"logo_path":"/Tmc9JLmLPTSQUgsMP4BjCN8Off.png","name":"Scholastic Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Her teacher smiled.","title":"The Dot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thora Birch","original_name":"Thora Birch","popularity":1.1454,"profile_path":"/m0D1wqgQeVCr7gWY7GVej7lZlwY.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"5b8ac425925141517b01aa45","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2109876,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter H.
