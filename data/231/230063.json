Just as Heidi adjusts to her new life in the mountains, she is taken away by her social worker (a scrappy beagle). Heidi finds herself living in the big city with Clara Sesehound (a cockapoo mix), who has been made an invalid after a debilitating illness. Although Heidi comes to love Clara, her quest to return to the mountains dominates her stay. In the end, she is able to reunite with her beloved Grandfather. When Clara later comes to visit, the final miracle of Heidi's story is revealed when Clara regains her ability to walk.","popularity":1.8437,"poster_path":"/uP3tEUDCrqfdpLQxcOhrHnIwSVh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heidi 4 Paws","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Heidi auf 4 Pfoten (2008)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Heidi auf 4 Pfoten","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59846,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanne Baron","original_name":"Joanne Baron","popularity":0.4134,"profile_path":"/cd9dbkbTcDTtFWli2YrkYMgiwGU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Detie (voice)","credit_id":"5e1ccef0e194b00016b85ba9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kimberly Beck","original_name":"Kimberly Beck","popularity":0.6568,"profile_path":"/hdeafwyoYDEF1i3zR7TX0skACcS.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Clara the Invalid / Frau Ragaz (voice)","credit_id":"5e1ccf06d5dbc20017f423e1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marshall Bell","original_name":"Marshall Bell","popularity":0.7846,"profile_path":"/3AdZRUFlmV9KvArzqSVEVZVl0Sa.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Mr. Sesehund (voice)","credit_id":"5e1ccf1ee194b00014b7eb89","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":35552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Majandra Delfino","original_name":"Majandra Delfino","popularity":0.2982,"profile_path":"/vpUDcYXgKBQBB4hzY6KVPy1AIsk.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Miss Rottenmeier (voice)","credit_id":"5e1ccf2cd5dbc20015f43a5e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26472,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Guttenberg","original_name":"Steve Guttenberg","popularity":0.9873,"profile_path":"/ghTMepliFNcRQHNELs8pgNDsZyW.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Sebastian (voice)","credit_id":"5e1ccf3c0e29a20015f8509a","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Kind","original_name":"Richard Kind","popularity":1.6439,"profile_path":"/yWmuVQeQUzb5OSMVDoWkR0IylCK.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Grandfather (voice)","credit_id":"5e1ccf78d5dbc20013f45966","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14730,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Lansbury","original_name":"Angela Lansbury","popularity":1.7365,"profile_path":"/gGAWbfMqhJnXzC8dRLeOSXOo9vO.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Grandmother (voice)","credit_id":"5e1ccf84d132d6001580dbad","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Rea","original_name":"Stephen Rea","popularity":0.9,"profile_path":"/17ZSGqvJqdvInuw1TlQlkf39yfi.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Doctor (voice)","credit_id":"5e1ccf9c12b10e0016941a8f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Sands","original_name":"Julian Sands","popularity":0.9005,"profile_path":"/8TYtEyKZle2B3cUYT7FBM9HJRtZ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Peter the Goatherder","credit_id":"5e1ccfbe12b10e00129436dc","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":228239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darius Anderson","original_name":"Darius Anderson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Driver Dog (voice)","credit_id":"67c8f6fa3dd7da394f2492aa","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":71338,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Holly Goldberg Sloan","original_name":"Holly Goldberg Sloan","popularity":0.1271,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4dcec3a36847f826eea7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1156448","wikidata_id":"Q5698803","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":928,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uP3tEUDCrqfdpLQxcOhrHnIwSVh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":649},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cHFgMB9rSd7LogBlM603V3EXqAK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-11-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
