Paddle To The Ocean is a documentary film about using a banjo, a kayak and a bicycle to recover from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. In 2011, Zac Crouse (musician, recreation therapist and expedition kayaker) toured his album 'You Plan To Do Nothing' from Ottawa ON to Halifax NS using only a sea kayak and a bicycle. It was a journey Zac had intended to do with his friend Corey; who sadly passed away while on a kayaking adventure with Zac in Nova Scotia. Paddle To The Ocean is a tribute to Zac's friend, but it also examines the stigma associated with mental illness while demonstrating the benefits of physical activity and music.","popularity":0.0782,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2013-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paddle to the Ocean","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266127,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zac Crouse","original_name":"Zac Crouse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f82731cd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266127,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zac Crouse","original_name":"Zac Crouse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f82731f1","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266128,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kelsey Thompson","original_name":"Kelsey Thompson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f8273203","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266127,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zac Crouse","original_name":"Zac Crouse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f8273209","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266127,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zac Crouse","original_name":"Zac Crouse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f82731e5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266131,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Daniel Ledwell","original_name":"Daniel Ledwell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f827320f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266127,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zac Crouse","original_name":"Zac Crouse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f827321b","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266128,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kelsey Thompson","original_name":"Kelsey Thompson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f82731fd","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266128,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kelsey Thompson","original_name":"Kelsey Thompson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f8273215","department":"Crew","job":"Digital Effects Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266128,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kelsey Thompson","original_name":"Kelsey Thompson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f8273221","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266127,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Zac Crouse","original_name":"Zac Crouse","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f82731d9","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266130,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kris Pope","original_name":"Kris Pope","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f82731f7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266128,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kelsey Thompson","original_name":"Kelsey Thompson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f82731d3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266129,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Stephanie Purcell","original_name":"Stephanie Purcell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f82731eb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1266128,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Kelsey Thompson","original_name":"Kelsey Thompson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4de4c3a36847f82731df","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3088570","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"G","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Paddle To The Ocean Official Trailer","key":"xkHPoeYAd-0","published_at":"2013-02-09T17:00:11.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec720c3a368544800b638"}]}}}
