An abusive and often intoxicated man, John rules the household, and though his attacks on Steve result in emergency hospital visits, Cheryl's loyalty is to her boyfriend. To protect her relationship with John, she \"ditches\" her son, having him arrested and locked in a correctional \"mental\" facility, before coercing her older brother Burt, who lives in Hollywood, to take him. Steve quickly discovers that Burt cannot even provide temporary lodging, but an administrator at his new high school directs him to a shelter for runaway kids where he soon learns to navigate his way.","popularity":1.9007,"poster_path":"/e5MP8ffcMEW3OmA9L88EtwJeKhK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201284,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stronghold Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Your Life Can Change","title":"Runaways","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58119,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Austin O'Brien","original_name":"Austin O'Brien","popularity":0.7876,"profile_path":"/IQypQEGa3HNv5Eg5PxcKt3BnaL.jpg","cast_id":31,"character":"Steve Moore","credit_id":"6478af30e323f301275063e9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Demetrius Navarro","original_name":"Demetrius Navarro","popularity":0.1593,"profile_path":"/vkUrp4rElvknoL4N2Xq397YbyFQ.jpg","cast_id":32,"character":"Mike","credit_id":"6478af3dcf4b8b012274ab2f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arielle Paul","original_name":"Arielle Paul","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":33,"character":"Sally Donaldson","credit_id":"6478af51e323f300a7d469fc","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":93523,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Esteban Powell","original_name":"Esteban Powell","popularity":0.3221,"profile_path":"/nQuuT1Yj4mLNbL1ZXTHV8wQYv7F.jpg","cast_id":34,"character":"Andy","credit_id":"6478af5ae323f300c428c658","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4091834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caitlin Sedio","original_name":"Caitlin Sedio","popularity":0.0709,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":35,"character":"Kristy Moore","credit_id":"6478af660e29a200bf1d9b7b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arif S.
