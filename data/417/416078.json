He examines childhood fears, adulthood and its lies, and the enlightenment that comes with grace. With the help of fellow travelers like Dostoyevsky and Kafka, Pressburger boldly takes on the problems of evil and suffering as found in very different cultures. His is a priceless example of bearing witness and an in-depth look at the workings of the soul.","popularity":0.0511,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2016-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il Profumo del Tempo delle Favole","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Il profumo del tempo delle favole","type":"Documentario"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1423134,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giorgio Pressburger","original_name":"Giorgio Pressburger","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"57dad526c3a368423b000de9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1334589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniele Tenze","original_name":"Daniele Tenze","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"57dad53292514146dd000bc1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antonio Cacace","original_name":"Antonio Cacace","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"57dad54cc3a3684206000d52","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679418,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mauro Caputo","original_name":"Mauro Caputo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57dad51cc3a368423b000de1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5917326","wikidata_id":"Q26884123","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice Film Festival","release_date":"2016-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
