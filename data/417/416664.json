Modesto is a city that lies in California's Central Valley, a region devastated during America's Great Depression. Modesto's notorious South Ninth Street (\"the Nine\") is a no man's land where the rules of polite society do not apply. The people living along the Nine form a ravaged micro community whose Darwinian existence is a day to day hustle, and survival is by any means necessary.","popularity":0.1857,"poster_path":"/csI2gJk8yl38j0QVycovL1DWre0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82088,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Annex, part of John McNeil Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nine","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2004665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linsay Rousseau","original_name":"Linsay Rousseau","popularity":0.1703,"profile_path":"/9SxHZf6ez6a4X1IS7HbbZDpJUFd.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"TV Anchor","credit_id":"5ab6d87ec3a3680a3101191e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2006857,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shannon Lujan","original_name":"Shannon Lujan","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/tWSn1U4Xa4hIScC1bcjtxnAnk8r.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Reporter","credit_id":"5ab6d8a89251413961012bdd","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katy Grannan","original_name":"Katy Grannan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57f53aaec3a3687c710008e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1689681,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katy Grannan","original_name":"Katy Grannan","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab6d9340e0a261ff101383a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hannah Hughes","original_name":"Hannah Hughes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab6d8e79251413961012c0e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006860,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Artimese Fairley","original_name":"Artimese Fairley","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab6d918925141396401147c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1850535,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Stephen Berger","original_name":"Stephen Berger","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ab6da470e0a261fdf0142eb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt4844324","wikidata_id":"Q24705545","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1971,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/csI2gJk8yl38j0QVycovL1DWre0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1314}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":387,"name":"california"},{"id":190178,"name":"sex worker"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
