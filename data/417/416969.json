René Pape is riveting as the Tsar of the title, giving a commanding and charismatic performance of one of the greatest bass roles in the repertoire—his Boris is dominating, tortured, flawed and utterly unforgettable. The extraordinary cast and the Met Orchestra and Chorus are led by Russian maestro Valery Gergiev, the foremost Mussorgsky interpreter of our time.","popularity":0.3825,"poster_path":"/3dc1lE1tdoBh9AI7gwV8ZA9z6Mr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":203,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Boris Godunov","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Met: Live in HD - Boris Godunov","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Great Performances at the Met: Boris Godunov","type":"TV title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"René Pape","original_name":"René Pape","popularity":0.1141,"profile_path":"/1VsWqoYANXZNivalpSZfNNqny2H.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Boris Godunov","credit_id":"57e0f636925141044e004445","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682493,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oleg Balashov","original_name":"Oleg Balashov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Prince Shuisky","credit_id":"57e0f64c925141045c00442f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":585996,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Petrenko","original_name":"Mikhail Petrenko","popularity":0.113,"profile_path":"/9IkIsvUzhvC4XM1e2hTjkZnYAQU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Pimen","credit_id":"57e0f665c3a36853eb004820","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1437950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aleksandrs Antonenko","original_name":"Aleksandrs Antonenko","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/en4KNbSDmU9Rhu7uey7GEOALOz0.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Grigory","credit_id":"57e0f6809251410455004864","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1567668,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ekaterina Semenchuk","original_name":"Ekaterina Semenchuk","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/z7rTjbrJTfAvCjtZeo5RUYhqagv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Marina","credit_id":"57e0f69592514104530044ea","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":935409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yevgeni Nikitin","original_name":"Yevgeni Nikitin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Rangoni","credit_id":"57e0f737c3a36853fb0041b9","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1676615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Ognovenko","original_name":"Vladimir Ognovenko","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Varlaam","credit_id":"57e0f7c792514104550048d6","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1374927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valerian Ruminski","original_name":"Valerian Ruminski","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Nikitich","credit_id":"57e0f86dc3a36854020049eb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Svetlov","original_name":"Mikhail Svetlov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Mitiukha","credit_id":"57e0f8aec3a36853fb004265","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682497,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Olga Savova","original_name":"Olga Savova","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Innkeeper","credit_id":"57e0f8c5c3a3685402004a10","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nikolai Gassiev","original_name":"Nikolai Gassiev","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Missail","credit_id":"57e0f90f92514104530045ac","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1676623,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gennady Bezzubenkov","original_name":"Gennady Bezzubenkov","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Officer","credit_id":"57e0f92a925141044e004536","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682499,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Zeltan","original_name":"Jennifer Zeltan","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Xenia","credit_id":"57e0f93fc3a36853f7003f55","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682500,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan A.
