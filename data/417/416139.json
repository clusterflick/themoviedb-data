The Dallas-born quartet took a brief hiatus after their fifth album, SATELLITE RIDES, but returned with a bang with 2004s DRAG IT UP, which garnered kudos from fans and critics alike. Here, the indomitable rockers are captured live at Hollywood's famed Troubador, energetically performing a set of nearly two dozen of their most beloved tunes.","popularity":0.1204,"poster_path":"/8afs3vFBbH4bimjoKKIzwkD6238.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old 97's: Live","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1528191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rhett Miller","original_name":"Rhett Miller","popularity":0.0785,"profile_path":"/pu1pcZBbkq43qxECHi3YzbZfLnn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5f091e725e12000038eabfbf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2083088,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murry Hammond","original_name":"Murry Hammond","popularity":0.0952,"profile_path":"/taacX0E5NrvN2aB9jM3934KdnMP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5f091ee555bc3500361ef05b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2083089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Bethea","original_name":"Ken Bethea","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5f091f06d5ffcb0035826e05","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2083090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Peeples","original_name":"Philip Peeples","popularity":0.0482,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5f091f20d5ffcb003680e270","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0769535","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8afs3vFBbH4bimjoKKIzwkD6238.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
