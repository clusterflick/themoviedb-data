Filmmaker and close friend Samadian avoids the talking heads of so many artistic memoirs to offer more candid clips of Kiarostami the man: lover of poetry, convivial with friends, engaging landscapes on and off screen, laughing with other artists. The artist and visionary emerges more clearly but so does a loving, wondrous man whom we will miss now as much as the auteur.","popularity":0.3113,"poster_path":"/jO6h5pw08Sm4gD3U92Wq48PpTqS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2016-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"76 Minutes and 15 seconds with Abbas Kiarostami","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Abbas Kiarostami","original_name":"Abbas Kiarostami","popularity":1.0278,"profile_path":"/rTlz5ciu41FxyVuXA82a3tSYVZ8.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"57dd8b45c3a368142c0010d7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120229,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jafar Panahi","original_name":"Jafar Panahi","popularity":0.204,"profile_path":"/viZZkkfcuWze68bvUiMZmYZe8Qg.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5917e300925141580d03d6bd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816412,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ali Reza Raiesian","original_name":"Ali Reza Raiesian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5917e338c3a3683fb603a2a2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1816413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tahereh Ladanian","original_name":"Tahereh Ladanian","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5917e34d925141061e03675c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Juliette Binoche","original_name":"Juliette Binoche","popularity":1.4758,"profile_path":"/llNGfF2gNBa1l39iqmjhZuDDzn6.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5917e366c3a3683fb603a2d2","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1680759,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seifollah Samadian","original_name":"Seifollah Samadian","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57dd8b68925141785d0010a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6135424","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":729,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/np2ODR1xTxqqrcEf5gcPo4kI2ff.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":2,"width":1296}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jO6h5pw08Sm4gD3U92Wq48PpTqS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":667},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xJJYyoid8aTvkPQU7NWds4wwFK2.jpg","vote_average":2.278,"vote_count":3,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/grmDw0M2p3jw1U32W4DoqArAicJ.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2016-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
