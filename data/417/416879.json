The beautiful Delphi Lawrence heads a stellar cast, including such reliables as Victor Maddern, Norman Rossington, Conrad Phillips and Reginald Hearne. The plot centers around acrobat Peter Arne, falsely accused of murder. Escaping from the authorities, Arne hides out in a rustic inn, allowing first-time director (and former cinematographer) Robert Day ample opportunity for dark, menacing shadows and sinister underlighting. The genuine murderer is revealed just seconds before the culprit's death. Stranger's Meeting was held back from release until Robert Day's \"official\" directorial debut, The Green Man, had made the rounds.","popularity":0.6705,"poster_path":"/wAErLKJtUHSh0AKvbMjeWa9xaY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1957-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strangers' Meeting","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14955,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Arne","original_name":"Peter Arne","popularity":0.195,"profile_path":"/zIpRwfHgXz8OpBwAzhQ7u6VRrnR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Harry Belair","credit_id":"620ed2afa84ff7006d1c2daf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Delphi Lawrence","original_name":"Delphi Lawrence","popularity":0.1947,"profile_path":"/azgeyxIlzTewzPZlxo8AlqJvRTJ.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Margot Sanders","credit_id":"620ed2bf3f4833006b73b283","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11133,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conrad Phillips","original_name":"Conrad Phillips","popularity":0.251,"profile_path":"/3YnzOo8nXweKyzbQ5LkEcMjE51z.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"David Sanders","credit_id":"620ed2cfe0ca7f001b68d801","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":78946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Archer","original_name":"Barbara Archer","popularity":0.0985,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Rosie Foster","credit_id":"620ed2e2f48e0d006710b278","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40965,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Maddern","original_name":"Victor Maddern","popularity":0.3549,"profile_path":"/4oBfDNbUMIqEANUsGPaLvNGUbhp.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Willie Fisher","credit_id":"620ed2f21f0275006a63dd4b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2294988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ritch","original_name":"David Ritch","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Giovanni","credit_id":"620ed334151c5c006915b00e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":68288,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doris Hare","original_name":"Doris Hare","popularity":0.1622,"profile_path":"/3UVVQKonmHFRJ0reZsA7R2t2BxT.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Nellie","credit_id":"620ed372d100b60041966028","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1779297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Kelly","original_name":"John Kelly","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/cE6XmLWtpBMARYzCBipPWd1ZDrz.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Michael O'Hara","credit_id":"620ed386a84ff70020ce8780","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Lodge","original_name":"David Lodge","popularity":0.1605,"profile_path":"/rYb40i92d3qqMu9ioYdiT2ZM42X.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Fred","credit_id":"620ed3a1c7a7e0006ba13999","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Rossington","original_name":"Norman Rossington","popularity":0.2208,"profile_path":"/l3sLtmYvdCUZuMywcOupkQkaLTn.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Barrow Boy","credit_id":"620ed3b57ad08c001b8f3d31","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Selma Vaz Dias","original_name":"Selma Vaz Dias","popularity":0.0398,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Magda Mayer","credit_id":"620ed3c7151c5c001c3c4c13","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1769245,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lesley Nunnerley","original_name":"Lesley Nunnerley","popularity":0.335,"profile_path":"/bYnY25F8LFKQfZb7lOunpl9kMGf.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Miss Parke","credit_id":"620ed3d69824c8001bde164c","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":100979,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Douglas Hickox","original_name":"Douglas Hickox","popularity":0.134,"profile_path":"/6ptbrjklyCKu20tAFffPHCzRwGz.jpg","credit_id":"620ed46a3f4833006b73b75d","department":"Directing","job":"Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062061,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"E.M.
