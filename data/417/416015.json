Then there is Chun-hee in Seoul, 2009, living with the eyes of the missing girl. With some help (?) from her father Chun-hee‘s corneas were donated to her in 1991. Yet corneas donation must happen postmortem, a gift coming from somebody’s death. Today Chun-hee works at a real estate agency, showing houses and lands for development. One day she is given the task of introducing lands in Hwaseong, a misfortunate place of past but being developed into a high-tech industrial city now. Then she finally sets foot there in Hwaseong.","popularity":0.4687,"poster_path":"/hqEjFyJG0CEVqdVpZbUEHZbfZsA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2010-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Going to Mars","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1731537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hwang Seok-jeong","original_name":"황석정","popularity":0.4418,"profile_path":"/MEhgvZBDS890lfCSeUwHxWL3Xh.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5980b002925141492e015293","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1669101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ko Eun-ki","original_name":"고은기","popularity":0.1179,"profile_path":"/dE5GhAtPCvkjFW7Qu46wFZGijfp.jpg","credit_id":"5980afddc3a368109e01459a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1669101,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ko Eun-ki","original_name":"고은기","popularity":0.1179,"profile_path":"/dE5GhAtPCvkjFW7Qu46wFZGijfp.jpg","credit_id":"5980afcb9251414944014c2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ko","file_path":"/hqEjFyJG0CEVqdVpZbUEHZbfZsA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
