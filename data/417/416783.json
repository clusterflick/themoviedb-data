Culminating in his sad death as remembered by one of his sons and one of his daughters, the film looks at Barry's childhood, his time in prison, and his decision to go into music and thereby change his life. From producer/composer to his decision to sing his own material, from his formation of Love Unlimited (featuring his wife, who contributes along with her sister - also in the group), the film examines the life in detail until his untimely end. The film is narrated \"from the grave\" by Barry himself.","popularity":0.4463,"poster_path":"/hKw4rTN5Frt7QCIZcSnD6wA0CYE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16630,"logo_path":"/wpYzen9TZ7mOKwqhaLfq9zmGG2H.png","name":"BBC Four","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let the Music Play: The Barry White Story","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":98824,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry White","original_name":"Barry White","popularity":0.2087,"profile_path":"/z9VZwVtC1u6K27zj6xmnl40Y8TC.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"59b2b44fc3a3682c22099e48","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0993768","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":2197,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hKw4rTN5Frt7QCIZcSnD6wA0CYE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1476}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6412,"name":"rhythm and blues (r&b)"},{"id":10229,"name":"singer"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
