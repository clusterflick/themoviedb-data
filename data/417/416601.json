The 1940 talkie version was directed by Leslie Arliss, son of stage star George Arliss. The story remained the same: A middle-aged widower attempts to select a wife from his rural district's eligible females (Basil Sydney). Three unsuccessful dalliances later, the farmer settles for his housekeeper, whom the audience has been rooting for all along. The Farmer's Wife is a prime example of the sort of fare that struck a proper chord with British filmgoers, but whose appeal would be lost to any other nationality.","popularity":0.2874,"poster_path":"/m0zVyxsmBrmwFa1jhs6Shhp7jTb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1941-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Farmer's Wife","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Basil Sydney","original_name":"Basil Sydney","popularity":0.2792,"profile_path":"/myZrVjtZ6gjhwE29hH4l6mHhuCi.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Samuel Sweetland","credit_id":"57debfd09251413da3006f16","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":106154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wilfrid Lawson","original_name":"Wilfrid Lawson","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/ylLCOBNvc5g3AkRLBXfSY4KgoEr.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Churdles Ash","credit_id":"57debfdcc3a368141f00b48a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":88895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nora Swinburne","original_name":"Nora Swinburne","popularity":0.2224,"profile_path":"/5K8cv6cJAFJfdresPBgI1EkOaLH.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Araminta Grey","credit_id":"57debfea9251413d74007224","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":117413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patricia Roc","original_name":"Patricia Roc","popularity":0.1145,"profile_path":"/tEO6hqeoEnn11tusu2x8EX4fkot.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Sibley","credit_id":"57debff99251413d7400723a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Wilding","original_name":"Michael Wilding","popularity":0.3253,"profile_path":"/3JkhvgqUeHDWCM23CrkZYsubTgQ.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Richard Coaker","credit_id":"57dec005c3a36812c6006caf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1647584,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bunty Payne","original_name":"Bunty Payne","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Petronell","credit_id":"57dec013925141785500b657","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":288221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Enid Stamp-Taylor","original_name":"Enid Stamp-Taylor","popularity":0.1074,"profile_path":"/sL4L1RdUPY8q3EIhhBv7DdaN2LR.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Mary Hearne","credit_id":"57dec01fc3a36808ec00797e","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":106155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Warren","original_name":"Betty Warren","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/gLfmkOWxeGfl9x3heJLeU7ais2g.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Louisa Windeatt","credit_id":"57dec02cc3a36812980072eb","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":592419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Viola Lyel","original_name":"Viola Lyel","popularity":0.0558,"profile_path":"/qi6kOJ75BRcMFLD5SvUuABzGfef.jpg","cast_id":14,"character":"Thirza Tapper","credit_id":"6165c01953866e0048a7ce7f","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27941,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Rigby","original_name":"Edward Rigby","popularity":0.2206,"profile_path":"/fSu8T7lKswhIECZeMyzTDY65Git.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Tom Gurney","credit_id":"6165c0299d592c0061373c6e","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenneth Griffith","original_name":"Kenneth Griffith","popularity":0.4214,"profile_path":"/oXbxx70rQThClBDlb4ibudZ660B.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"George Smerdon","credit_id":"6165c03953866e006801f1f8","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":123903,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.
