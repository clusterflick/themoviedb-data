A lawyer from Germany brings along bitter news that Aymas's only daughter has passed away and left her fortune to his father.  Aimlessly ,Aymas wanders along the streets of the town which is constantly filled with fog. Fog lies both in the streets and in Aymas's brains. The fog can only be dispelled by wind or a girl named Samal, whom Aymas accidentally meets in the fog. If fact, the word samal means 'wind' in Central Asia. The girl is really like the wind - she's wayward, impulsive and unpredictable. She behaves exactly like she pleases. She scatters foundations. She's in love with another girl and she's very unhappy. To Aymas, Samal reminds of his daughter. For her sake, Aymas delves into a series of adventures with unpredictable consequences. It seems to him that they're getting closer to each other. But how can you can get closer to the wind and lock it into a cage?","popularity":0.1302,"poster_path":"/2t2qVIkgaRDgtLCIk62dOhYogKR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"UZ","name":"Uzbekistan"}],"release_date":"2015-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House for Mermaids","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Dom dlya rusalok","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Шахзода Матчанова","original_name":"Шахзода Матчанова","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Samal","credit_id":"57da816c92514179a7002660","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1679330,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yulia Usadova","original_name":"Юлия Усадова","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/wxfyAMS8y0fAcSgJqfoEpnHwJL4.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Djeiran","credit_id":"57da817f925141799e00264c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":587916,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seydulla Moldakhanov","original_name":"Сейдулла Молдаханов","popularity":0.1764,"profile_path":"/tOv78aWVBprw6PAAYyF5Oj2IQt2.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Aimas","credit_id":"57da819092514179970027f4","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1679327,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Рустам Мурадов","original_name":"Рустам Мурадов","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57da814bc3a36830e9002493","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1679326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ёлкин Туйчиев","original_name":"Ёлкин Туйчиев","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ccd310b7d66bdf0b1693fd","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1679326,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ёлкин Туйчиев","original_name":"Ёлкин Туйчиев","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66ccd318d314390edbb80fb7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3897322","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/DzJV9qUTVUHhqk9hMGXjpSyroY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"ru","file_path":"/2t2qVIkgaRDgtLCIk62dOhYogKR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"16+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Film Festival","release_date":"2015-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2},{"certification":"16+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
