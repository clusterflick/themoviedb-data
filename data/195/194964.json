The videos featured crude MS Paint animation and a loud, highpitched, childlike voice narrating. On September 7, the fifth, final episode was released, but featured an unexpected twist - about 20 seconds into it, the crude sketchy animation switched to intricately crafted 3D with an orchestral soundtrack; the whole Octocat story (and as such, the Randy Peters persona) was revealed to be by David O'Reilly.[8] In an interview he said \"I wanted to try experimenting with the Youtube audience and Microsoft Paint. The story for Octocat came to me by reading the bible word-for-word backwards\"","popularity":0.0453,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Octocat Adventures","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107850,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David O'Reilly","original_name":"David O'Reilly","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":"/12onvPCZy0dG8piurODp7R4g0U0.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d019251416c9110755d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1651921","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
