One of the sons leaves the room pretending to be ill and collects a bunch of flowers form a cupboard and goes out. The other son takes a bunch of flowers from under his bed and he too leaves, followed by their father, also carrying flowers. The two sons and their father call on the same young women one after the other; as each arrives, the previous suitor is hidden in a piece of furniture: the father under a chair cover, one son in a cupboard and the other in a piano. A girlfriend of the young woman visits and the two play pranks on the hiding men by playing the piano and sitting on the chair cover. The three men emerge and the father chases his two sons outside until they remind him of his own folly; he gives his sons some money and urges them to keep silent.","popularity":0.1246,"poster_path":"/zS8HzJ17XfY9zmKHSdOYMBP1GEi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1909-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love's Surprises","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Love's Surprises","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Las sorpresas del amor","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Les surprises de l'amour","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Linder","original_name":"Max Linder","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/b3PKyHuw6OyOATZeyOPJkC000mY.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4ce19251416c9110329f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1268326,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jacques Vandenne","original_name":"Jacques Vandenne","popularity":0.0429,"profile_path":"/1AwvHzlnUUcItuBur82pcWX0Xw1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6400ec819653f600894f38e9","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1016035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Linder","original_name":"Max Linder","popularity":0.1786,"profile_path":"/b3PKyHuw6OyOATZeyOPJkC000mY.jpg","credit_id":"6400ea40699fb7007d8f2e6e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1018792","wikidata_id":"Q122469036","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zS8HzJ17XfY9zmKHSdOYMBP1GEi.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zFpffBciJQUQxmS17OqD7ZH6sen.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1051,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/9dA5KqnQOy0Vi5Nn607q4KNW8cB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":700}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1909-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Les surprises de l'amour (1909) Love's Surprises","key":"17un3vKOguM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2019-11-04T05:22:57.000Z","id":"669d23b0a132703ad7880a01"}]}}}
