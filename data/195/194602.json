Van der Keuken once described her as follows: 'She was ten years old and the joy of the Achtergracht, where I was living at the time. An Amsterdam child, sweet and crooked as a corkscrew.' He films her while she skims the city with some friends and knocks at strangers' doors. Her family has nine children and is not well off. In those days, a visit to the De Miranda swimming pool cost a quarter, but only ten cents if the weather was bad. At school, Beppie gets a poor mark because she is too boisterous, but when the whole class rattles off the multiplication tables, she joins in at the top of her voice. All of TV-watching Holland was wildly enthusiastic about this portrait, with which Van der Keuken even made the front page of the national newspaper De Telegraaf.","popularity":0.1488,"poster_path":"/lOO7dF7LQe4htPzqRjFTORiiQOy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1965-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beppie","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1525531,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ed van der Elsken","original_name":"Ed van der Elsken","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":"/tsoU0BPhI421rh5fVTXkOIN96py.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"57977d56c3a36806bc002b39","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1656812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerda van der Elsken","original_name":"Gerda van der Elsken","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"57977d62925141068a0038fb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan van der Keuken","original_name":"Johan van der Keuken","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/zPqpgZaXeXe02OFiiikL5kg58RP.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cf09251416c91105323","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087383,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Johan van der Keuken","original_name":"Johan van der Keuken","popularity":0.0487,"profile_path":"/zPqpgZaXeXe02OFiiikL5kg58RP.jpg","credit_id":"57977d45c3a36855560045c3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0058964","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/acq5KfJyX3Ld7JkLjnpuDtvB8RE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/lOO7dF7LQe4htPzqRjFTORiiQOy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":587,"name":"amsterdam, netherlands"},{"id":12663,"name":"little girl"},{"id":14870,"name":"street urchin"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
