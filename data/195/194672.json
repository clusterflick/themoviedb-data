Max Bill was probably the most important swiss artist of the 20th century and the most famous student to come out of the legendary Bauhaus in Dessau. He was an ardent anti-fascist and all his avant-garde work as an artist, sculptor, architect and typographer showed a social responsibility and environmental awareness right through his life. His views have become incredibly topical.","popularity":0.3229,"poster_path":"/ezDbOfrEODme6riD4cwKryDcCVf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160443,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ariadnefilm GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2008-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Max Bill: The Master's Vision","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1276811,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Max Bill","original_name":"Max Bill","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":"/aD7QmVXO74OejACSPa67gIHSZ9d.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cf29251416c911056f1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erich Schmid","original_name":"Erich Schmid","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cf29251416c911056ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1276810,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Erich Schmid","original_name":"Erich Schmid","popularity":0.0387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6326f203dcb6a300820761a5","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1916183,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Ueli Nüesch","original_name":"Ueli Nüesch","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6326f224bbd0b0008217294d","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3705574,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Antoine Boissonnas","original_name":"Antoine Boissonnas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6326f241a67254007addc2ef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2451829,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"André Bellmont","original_name":"André Bellmont","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6326f25493bd6900822d6080","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1404020","wikidata_id":"Q32868665","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":844,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bwGvo7AZTVaoGj5cftjUOiLj2Ft.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1512,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/ezDbOfrEODme6riD4cwKryDcCVf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1008}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":74,"name":"germany"},{"id":1223,"name":"switzerland"},{"id":14893,"name":"art"},{"id":160077,"name":"design"},{"id":184184,"name":"bauhaus"},{"id":303226,"name":"artfilm"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
