From there, shots of the aircraft in flight with Wright at the controls along with an unidentified passenger cut to shots of onlookers on the ground, presumably military and press liaisons. The aircraft is shown in side-to-side flybys as well as low-altitude passes directly toward and away from the camera.\r The aerial shots begin at the 1:34 mark immediately after a shot of the aircraft coming to a landing directly approaching the camera.
