One of the earliest examples of Brazilian cinema, this film depicts the perilous journey of Pedro Álvares Cabral’s armada from Portugal to Brazil. Though somewhat rudimentary compared to other films of the period, The Discovery of Brazil distinguishes itself with its scenes of indigenous people and Portuguese explorers on the beach, and in the imaginative lighting on board the ship. But the real star is the beautiful cantata by Villa-Lobos that permeates the film.","popularity":0.1875,"poster_path":"/8HyZ9b2t5Dqnd7dvGp0AErmNnuW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100338,"logo_path":null,"name":"INCE - Instituto Nacional de Cinema Educativo","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1937-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Discovery of Brazil","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1174913,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvaro Costa","original_name":"Alvaro Costa","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Pedro Alvares Cabral","credit_id":"52fe4cf39251416c911058d9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1174914,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"João de Deus","original_name":"João de Deus","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cf39251416c911058dd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1174915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manoel Rocha","original_name":"Manoel Rocha","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4cf39251416c911058e1","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Humberto Mauro","original_name":"Humberto Mauro","popularity":0.0928,"profile_path":"/lPgeWkbKid3n7xVPCNbQCIfipiY.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4cf39251416c911058cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1174912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bandeira Duarte","original_name":"Bandeira Duarte","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4cf39251416c911058d5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545528,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heitor Villa-Lobos","original_name":"Heitor Villa-Lobos","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/y4ttkf36fSRCm2a4FP0Vzuat72j.jpg","credit_id":"5521b6d39251417be2003331","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0028780","wikidata_id":"Q10338996","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":899,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9gPMlT2QDHJBchwkTRfOPt7cjyU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1599}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1183,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/8HyZ9b2t5Dqnd7dvGp0AErmNnuW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":779}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"1936-05-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Cinemateca","release_date":"1937-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
