During the shooting, Stanley also encountered the Taliban.  Originally made for UNICEF, the film lacks narration save for a Suti poem.  Instead, it is accompanied by Simon Boswell's brilliant score.","popularity":0.2152,"poster_path":"/wPPIi5eQcJGISbD54FL2Q6yIlNa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","name":"Afghanistan"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voice of the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42175,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Stanley","original_name":"Richard Stanley","popularity":0.3425,"profile_path":"/vI3tIvvqUdjC1v8uVtIaDnEDWX4.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ced9251416c91104c37","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7741,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Boswell","original_name":"Simon Boswell","popularity":0.0694,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6009ea50391b9c0042d23ec7","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0275056","wikidata_id":"Q61049902","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wPPIi5eQcJGISbD54FL2Q6yIlNa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
