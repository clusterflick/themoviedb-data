Life at first proves difficult but Xiuya wins the children’s hearts through her music, and transforms the Orphanage and its Headmaster with her patient and nurturing spirit, leaving behind an inspiring legacy of love. Love Begins Here has obvious allusions to Robert Wise’s Sound of Music (1965) via its characters, the lederhosen-inspired uniforms, a musical number channeling Liesl and Rolfe, and the picture-perfect mountain grassland shots - but the similarities end there. Ostensibly to enlighten and encourage the young generation of post-war Taiwan, the film also borrows from Richard Bach’s popular Jonathan Livingston Seagull (1970), a novel (and later film) of  New Age philosophy of self-perfection and self-sacrifice.","popularity":0.0851,"poster_path":"/kB2cPqTKksjsXZQ9yFkrWcZaV68.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Begins Here","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Love Begins Here","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":555631,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Ongg","original_name":"ジュディ・オング","popularity":0.4564,"profile_path":"/msviA5PDxClR4e0z7nG79JeP8Dz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66cfea801f275ddefc9926be","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134886,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Liu Chia-chang","original_name":"Liu Chia-chang","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/fwfnpApZh0evs6a2rrrAkTtHLUq.jpg","credit_id":"66cfea6ff56d83e387a0b775","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1568441,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Teng Yu-Kun","original_name":"Teng Yu-Kun","popularity":0.0536,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c18513bc6935a001a269d7","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1766652,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Koo Chen-fu","original_name":"Koo Chen-fu","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c1852bbc6935a001a269de","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1590717,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Lin Tsan-Ting","original_name":"Lin Tsan-Ting","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/ljjZaWqfdhcRrdNiViiOx0AvPes.jpg","credit_id":"67c185468c386c4e5bc8f7ff","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134886,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Liu Chia-chang","original_name":"Liu Chia-chang","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":"/fwfnpApZh0evs6a2rrrAkTtHLUq.jpg","credit_id":"67c1855e8c386c4e5bc8f808","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1573786","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kB2cPqTKksjsXZQ9yFkrWcZaV68.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":839}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1973-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
