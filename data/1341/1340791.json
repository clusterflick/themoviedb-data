She has spent her life learning that her story is worth sharing and now she's sharing it with you. In 1962, Ms. JoAnna found the courage to take herself, her mother Rasheeda, and her siblings out of an abusive family situation to find freedom and community in the Indianapolis neighborhood Martindale-Brightwood. Every year since then, they have invited their family, friends, and neighbors on Columbia Street to celebrate \"Rasheeda's Freedom Day\" on the anniversary of their escape. As the film shows, a healthy community gives us the courage to share our stories with our neighbors so we can be known and loved.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":237639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue House Film and Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rasheeda's Freedom Day","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4912249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marlena Banks","original_name":"Marlena Banks","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Ms. Jimmie","credit_id":"66d103ac3f904f695b962703","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4912250,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Donaldson","original_name":"Ashley Donaldson","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Bus Extra","credit_id":"66d103bf6e37048c74b04d23","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4912251,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Journey Harrell","original_name":"Journey Harrell","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Baby Rasheeda","credit_id":"66d103c80229c4941e7897ff","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4893029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dija Renuka","original_name":"Dija Renuka","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d103edf77582b630962736","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4912252,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ruthie Buescher","original_name":"Ruthie Buescher","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d10411f77582b630962742","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3378408,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kurtis Bowersock","original_name":"Kurtis Bowersock","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d104302a757e1048789839","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4912255,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Moriah Miller","original_name":"Moriah Miller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d1043cb6302d1f54962752","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4893029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dija Renuka","original_name":"Dija Renuka","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d104469dc73a87a2b04cc7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4912257,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Seaux Chill","original_name":"Seaux Chill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d10451ea22ad562c941ad7","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3378408,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kurtis Bowersock","original_name":"Kurtis Bowersock","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d1045b67205a0635b04c81","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3378408,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Kurtis Bowersock","original_name":"Kurtis Bowersock","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d10460a1300cff710c0921","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4893029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dija Renuka","original_name":"Dija Renuka","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d1046fb6c634c8e8b5d4fd","department":"Production","job":"Casting"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
