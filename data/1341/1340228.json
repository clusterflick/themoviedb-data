From apartments in Mykolaiv, Kyiv, and Kharkiv, we see the traces of fallen bombs after the initial Russian attacks. Narrated from within small apartments, where residents try to gather shards of glass, belongings, and memories while attempting to comprehend the immeasurable tragedy that has befallen them.
