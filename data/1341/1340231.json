The film follows subjects as they navigate personal relationships and public interactions that alternately celebrate and challenge their decision—and raise questions about the reenactment of trauma, and the act of transforming that trauma into healing. In interweaving storylines, we will meet 3Gs whose stories reveal that historical remembrance is an essential part of engaging with social issues and the rise of hate and intolerance today.","popularity":0.4644,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":230181,"logo_path":"/9bjMEufvWqfNp1ZpO9c9Vc9sdxf.png","name":"Citizen Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Grandchildren of Holocaust survivors made the controversial decision to tattoo their grandparents’ concentration camp numbers on their own bodies.","title":"Under Their Skin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4910067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cathy R Fischer","original_name":"Cathy R Fischer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e86bd0e8211ecd22b12caa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1420988,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Sophie E.
