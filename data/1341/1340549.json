Wagner's work is critically examined and re-evaluated from a very personal perspective.\r This is done in an entertaining way that does not shy away from a popular and allusive form.\r The newly composed music by Nico Gaik takes up the most important leitmotifs of Wagner's opera and at the same time makes a tongue-in-cheek reference to the popular sound of big Holywood blockbusters.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/a2F7C3sJr9luD2AWoBBodjphPPS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parsifal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4911345,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tilman von Blomberg","original_name":"Tilman von Blomberg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d08d62acb2b942f611a961","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4911350,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nico Gaik","original_name":"Nico Gaik","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d08da3235a7bbf66d3350c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.708,"height":800,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a2F7C3sJr9luD2AWoBBodjphPPS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":566}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
