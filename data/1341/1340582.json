Of all the principal leads, Jacqueline Fleming comes off the strongest. As the high powered black female in the film, she's a no-nonsense diva whose your worst nightmare (\"I'm a black woman whose lost her house keys\"). There's a glow about Fleming that inhibits her character, and she's also brassy and gorgeous. All three women are attractive- the other two are white women, one is a ditsy lesbian and the other is a sexual bunny who changes outfits a lot.  Directed by the talented Marlies Carruth, \"Girlfriends\" has witty dialogue almost too witty for the women its about- in one scene in a coffee shop, a guy holds the place up, only to be dissected by one of the women as she confabulates to him using preppy vocabulary words.
