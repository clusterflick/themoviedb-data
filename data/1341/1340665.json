The first to notice is Brainchild, who has to challenge the others to break their routine. When he angers them, they try to fight him, but he outsmarts them and reveals they are in a military base deep underground. The Wonderkind and the rest of the group must go through the base to find Dreamchild, who holds the key to solving the mystery. Brainchild becomes their leader, working together to escape, but only if they learn to listen and trust in themselves.","popularity":0.0754,"poster_path":"/tdsL1xWKmm8GxqHXF62SE9ojW9l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":226029,"logo_path":null,"name":"Super Nation Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Progeny","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4911840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnathan Màrtin","original_name":"Johnathan Màrtin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/q60EH7jdoVV9rFpFVt2DKVef9ld.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Brainchild","credit_id":"66d0c1f7adae92a955c09d32","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4789342,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Ronald Sturgess","original_name":"Ronald Sturgess","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d0c204e782a58e4c0c077a","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1350,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tdsL1xWKmm8GxqHXF62SE9ojW9l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":336934,"name":"the progeny"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
