The film takes audiences into dark allegorical scenes depicting religious iconography, outmoded superstition, and slapstick comedy. Sick Serena employs imagery from British ecclesiastic stained glass to create a visually and conceptually rich, dense and multi-layered film. The work references Pier Paolo Pasolini's controversial 1963 short film La Ricotta, for which he was imprisoned for blasphemy on the basis of 'enacting' a religious scene as a comedy sketch. The scenes that unfold invoke both a sense of unease and amusement.","popularity":0.0882,"poster_path":"/bXWEVCXEzYLJo0Cud5cUkgWH1ZQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"16mm Colour Film","title":"Sick Serena and Dregs and Wreck and Wreck","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1374704,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Emily Wardill","original_name":"Emily Wardill","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cff03d179509fd3fbb33a5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3190817,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Podpadec","original_name":"John Podpadec","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cff06c9bfceb13a7ec4024","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3190817,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"John Podpadec","original_name":"John Podpadec","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cff07b235a7bbf66d32f4e","department":"Crew","job":"Lighting Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4910395,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Baker","original_name":"Paul Baker","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cff0a35ee6f9b067bb3332","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554233,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Louise Allen","original_name":"Louise Allen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cff0d45ba7b02c0459b719","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Hairstylist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1554233,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Louise Allen","original_name":"Louise Allen","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cff0e524736aa9bc3f16eb","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup & Hair"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3178462,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dominic Fitzgerald","original_name":"Dominic Fitzgerald","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cff0fcd41af2938ba48282","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Engineer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bXWEVCXEzYLJo0Cud5cUkgWH1ZQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
