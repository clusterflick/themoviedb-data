In a post-USA province called Pacifica, Colonel Casper Mach rules with an iron fist. In a fairly lame attempt at repackaging himself as a beloved media icon, he also appears each morning as host of a TV show, \"Breakfast With The Colonel.\" Jack Sorenson, a citizen of Pacifica Province, has never considered himself a revolutionary. But after a missed rent payment and similar grievous offenses, he's declared \"lifestyle dysfunctional\" and the state sets about fulfilling his unrealized potential. Jack resists. Before long he's a fugitive, pursued by the Colonel's brutal militia. Ultimately Jack encounters the Colonel himself.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/snU4C5a5EAUv1PXpGDElntsE5lw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":238437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fidget Barn","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Watch it buddy!","title":"Breakfast with the Colonel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Struble","original_name":"Peter Struble","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jack Sorenson","credit_id":"66dc8ed2b1131e08579dbbf0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Priscilla Stewart","original_name":"Priscilla Stewart","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Bonnie","credit_id":"66dc8ee369f963646c645a6a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929259,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Boman","original_name":"Mike Boman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66dc8eed7ec73e907e4974ed","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929261,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Kahle","original_name":"Tim Kahle","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Ed","credit_id":"66dc8f146540893c55497658","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4929262,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Erik J.
