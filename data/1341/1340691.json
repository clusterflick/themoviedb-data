DEAD LAND was filmed upon the completion of Sara Paretsky’s 20th V.I. Warshawski novel in 2020. Paretsky (hailed by P. D. James as “the most remarkable” of modern crime writers\") reflects on 40 years of writing crime novels and how the death of her husband shaped the most recent installment in her series. During a Panel Discussion with author Sara Paretsky and filmmakers, we shared stories about launching a new book and making a film during quarantine.
