Drawing on the experience of numerous inspiring social movements, the film shows how climate change driven by profiteering from our global systems has destroyed our planet and increased inequality. We need to transform global infrastructure and services to be people oriented, by building a global mass workers and peasants movement to enact a just transition.  For the people, by the people, and never for profit. Because government and big business aren’t going to do it for us.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/yrpMdobNAUTZdhvNBd5t0YGc6Mu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":237591,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reel News","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Multiple Crises — One Solution","title":"Everything Must Change","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4911161,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Rowan Mataram","original_name":"Rowan Mataram","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d07b933f42de912a032dd5","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4911158,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Zahra Dalilah","original_name":"Zahra Dalilah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66d07b7d13b1728a778844ea","department":"Crew","job":"Creator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/yrpMdobNAUTZdhvNBd5t0YGc6Mu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":768}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2023-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Everything Must Change - trailer","key":"ZIVG0N5qbQs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2023-03-22T22:02:24.000Z","id":"66d0516bb4247b1b6c473e2b"}]}}}
