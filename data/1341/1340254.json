She just wanted to be the perfect Christian wife to the perfect Christian husband; yet after a trip to a New Age store and an introduction to the 'intentionally-crafted' pendant called 'Keepsake', Lauren Michaels experiences a painful epiphany (by way of a 'supernatural influence') about self, love, life and her marriage. In this short film, we witness the dramatic transformation of a 'devout Christian'. The 'Keepsake' pendant affects people differently; for Lauren Michaels, the effect seems extremely drastic.","popularity":0.1074,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":236971,"logo_path":null,"name":"2nd Childhood Productions, LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2024-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An 'old artifact' in a New Age store becomes introduced to a devout Christian; the result: clarity, enlightenment, and 'atonement'?","title":"Keepsake","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4052335,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sarah Williams","original_name":"Sarah Williams","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Lauren Michaels","credit_id":"66cfcebc507c3ab8bb6a0028","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":99912,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerard Marzilli","original_name":"Gerard Marzilli","popularity":0.0492,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Chris Michaels","credit_id":"66cfced4f02be4e143d3f239","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1201468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bron Theron","original_name":"Bron Theron","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Gus","credit_id":"66cfcee00ba4f82ae8a47dbd","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4898485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tanya O'Quinn","original_name":"Tanya O'Quinn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cfcef16ea4941437a0b30f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4898485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tanya O'Quinn","original_name":"Tanya O'Quinn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cfcef64a89d30dac59b4f9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4898485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tanya O'Quinn","original_name":"Tanya O'Quinn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cfcf00179509fd3fbb2f6b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4898485,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tanya O'Quinn","original_name":"Tanya O'Quinn","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cfcf067424a73dd3ec3bb8","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4052308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Newsome","original_name":"Chad Newsome","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cfcf1174ea91696b119ea3","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4052308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chad Newsome","original_name":"Chad Newsome","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cfcf1658e7d5f8cce30182","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4910195,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Grace Ekmekjian","original_name":"Grace Ekmekjian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cfcf1f7a438862f072375c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4910196,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sheila Brown","original_name":"Sheila Brown","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66cfcf2d5cddcbcd78bd924e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4910198,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Christopher R.
