During the day, Alberto makes a living helping the women of the neighborhood to clean clothes. When night comes, he transforms himself to perform pasodobles and coplas by Marifé de Triana. Rambal is a homosexual in an era marked by repression. On April 16, 1976 he was murdered. A brave tribute to an iconic character.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1O76VpXo6DUX26IWgAsVmJVurPE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rambal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3565567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mar González Villanueva","original_name":"Mar González Villanueva","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62904cd09a64350065bc4de3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.664,"height":753,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/1O76VpXo6DUX26IWgAsVmJVurPE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
