Hurrying from the theater the old musician finds little Helen sleeping on the steps of the stage door. He picks her up and takes her to his comfortably furnished home. The old man even grows childish, he is so pleased with the little tot's presence and he gives her the love with which his heart abounds. The next day he learns from the morning papers that Helen's mother and father were lost in a fire. He spends many happy hours with her, playing with her toys. He takes her to rehearsals with him, where she is the pet of the musicians. One year later Helen shows an aptness for the stage. This delights the old musician and the child grows nearer and dearer to his heart. A sad blow, however, comes to him when the Children's Society take the little girl away from him and once more he finds himself a lonely old man.","popularity":0.3288,"poster_path":"/iiDxIXSkn6iLV1R0SAjhM30M7UZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The First Violin","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1156959,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Van Dyke Brooke","original_name":"Van Dyke Brooke","popularity":0.0867,"profile_path":"/srLqffFE7o3SrBJPFwf9zLRb5g8.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Von Schultz - an Old Musician","credit_id":"62917c1b12425c00a0da9d0f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":998697,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flora Finch","original_name":"Flora Finch","popularity":0.1535,"profile_path":"/r1Af5GrRy6uKDRwsWTxrsitpmIy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Helen's Step-Mother","credit_id":"62917c2bfd63000050e06d73","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127305,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bunny","original_name":"John Bunny","popularity":0.0882,"profile_path":"/jKA4iSzu1mCzPEP5U3kKBxJRpgt.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Helen's Step-Father","credit_id":"62917c3eecbde90b619973c2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1047595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helene Costello","original_name":"Helene Costello","popularity":0.1336,"profile_path":"/3SvCiydhPLPyQtWIoEQtsRoBYt.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Helen - a Little Waif","credit_id":"62917c4e85b10500526f13d0","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142371,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maurice Costello","original_name":"Maurice Costello","popularity":0.11,"profile_path":"/92Q6cg7efdgMrmNbGNXBoF2hrpB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62917c5aecbde90b5ff6a706","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":587953,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norma Talmadge","original_name":"Norma Talmadge","popularity":0.1066,"profile_path":"/h8ES1kk8EEByz34sKaWMDyB6Ntv.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62917c63ed2ac216b9060c4b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1523891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hazel Neason","original_name":"Hazel Neason","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/uPLHUBSouappjogIdTGcT1fGMFp.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62917c6f9a64350065c03567","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":121416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Price","original_name":"Kate Price","popularity":0.1337,"profile_path":"/auh0gxFdHdeT08W9zEv9VQMYa95.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62917c79cddbbc0e1aad16d7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":145838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alec B.
