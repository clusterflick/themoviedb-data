Bayasgalang's childhood was spent on the back of a racehorse, and his teammate studied at school in Darsuren and returned to his hometown as a teacher. While Darsuren and his students were walking in the countryside, an artist from the city attacked and painted them. Misunderstanding the mutual respect between the artist and the teacher, Bayasgalan went to the city to accept the idea that horsemanship is not a profession, and he faced great difficulties in not finding a job. On the way, he meets an artist who is suspicious of Darsuren, his wife and children, and introduces Bayasgalan. He tells the story of how he is returning to his hometown after realizing that he has wasted his time by abandoning his profession to be suspicious of an innocent man.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/9t9k3ol6r4nJd67cMSfHTAlhzpl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2733,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mongolkino","origin_country":"MN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MN","name":"Mongolia"}],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mongolian","iso_639_1":"mn","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bayasgalan","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"MN","title":"Bayasgalan","type":"(original title)"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bayasgalan","type":"World-wide (English title)"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3566700,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ochirjav Tseren","original_name":"Ts.
