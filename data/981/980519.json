Paul Van Doren never skateboarded, surfed, snowboarded, or flipped a BMX bike, but his simple, rubber-soled sneaker from 1966 has been at the heart of the global action-sports movement for half a century. This is the candid, comedic, and occasionally tragic portrait of Paul and his company, some of the world-renowned athletes he inspired, and the hard lessons he's learned along the way, including why you must NEVER CATCH PIGEONS.","popularity":0.0451,"poster_path":"/iOTzYXT8ZUmzidN8eEB9cMlZoBE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Never Catch Pigeons: And Eleven More Hard Lessons from Mr. Paul Van Doren","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15614264","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.679,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iOTzYXT8ZUmzidN8eEB9cMlZoBE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":509}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2022-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
