Hiroshima is a city where sake brewing is thriving. Senzaburo Miura, the \"father of ginjo-shu\" who made Japan's first ginjo-shu (sake made from rice at a polishing ratio below 60%), is the pride of Hiroshima. Senzaburo's spirit of \"try one hundred times, improve one thousand times\" overlaps with that of the Japanese people who survived through the prewar and postwar periods. Now, the spirit of Japanese master craftsmanship is shared with the world from Japan.","popularity":0.2979,"poster_path":"/b7xpI0zINcoC640uzJR1UtUh2qs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2022-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Master Sake Brewers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":235291,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manami Higa","original_name":"比嘉愛未","popularity":0.4966,"profile_path":"/i9AUqA0z9OeAkLNvkvAIXwUdAXN.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6371e94dbf0f6300b492a47f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":123131,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Naho Toda","original_name":"戸田菜穂","popularity":0.8299,"profile_path":"/txQ6w8MGQalmkVNXieHoi5l8oqi.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6371e952e9c0dc007ffcde48","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1616141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tengai Shibuya II","original_name":"Tengai Shibuya II","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6371e95c21621b0091135b1a","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3785097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seiji Aburanti","original_name":"Seiji Aburanti","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6371e9696bdec3008a7c03f0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4734885,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Toshimitsu Matsuoka","original_name":"松岡利光","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67710d715863b1e81912897f","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt22248230","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"ginzuru_movie","twitter_id":"ginzuru_movie"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1019,"iso_639_1":"ja","file_path":"/b7xpI0zINcoC640uzJR1UtUh2qs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
