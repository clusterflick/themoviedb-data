He was more than a simple woodsman in coonskin cap. He enjoyed political success when elected on the United States' Congress and where he championed the rights of squatters. However, when he failed to be re-elected in 1835, he set off for Texas to find wealth and prosperity. He soon joined a company of American volunteers to fight the despot Santa Anna and his Mexican army at San Antonio.\r In March, 1836, all of the 189 brave Americans, including Davy Crockett, lay dead on the ground, but with them also lay over one thousand five hundred Mexicans who had died at their hands.","popularity":0.2961,"poster_path":"/2iSNRJ0tBV1LlfSKaiaIRjnbHVr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Wild West: Davy Crockett","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28947,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christopher L.
