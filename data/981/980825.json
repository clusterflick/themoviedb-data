Raghav and Najma, lovers of diametrically opposite faith, have a relationship that speaks volumes of their love and connection with each other. They have seen, ironically, dreams of a future together. Lived experiences of enjoying sunsets at the beach, cherished good food and made promises, within the scope of their handicap.  A twist in the story compels Raghav to take a harsh decision, not because of lack of faith in Najma's intentions, but because he loves her enough. Love doesn't mean to possess, it needs to be set free.  A heartwarming story of love and sacrifice, through the eyes in blindness.","popularity":0.4719,"poster_path":"/ILQG2t3gDJZLhQVbQgAzCLHlU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176113,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golden Medias","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Blind is Love","title":"The Blind Date","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3098387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chandan P Singh","original_name":"Chandan P Singh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Raghav Shinde","credit_id":"629149df85b1050068952f14","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3566531,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zeba Sheriff","original_name":"Zeba Sheriff","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Nazma Sheikh","credit_id":"629149f9ecbde90b60018e23","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3566530,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mihir Dhirajlal Upadhyay","original_name":"Mihir Dhirajlal Upadhyay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629148b209ed8f00650a54b1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3566530,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mihir Dhirajlal Upadhyay","original_name":"Mihir Dhirajlal Upadhyay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6291489912425c005225b1a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3566530,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mihir Dhirajlal Upadhyay","original_name":"Mihir Dhirajlal Upadhyay","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"629148a476eecf00652699ca","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt14968334","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"upadhyay.mihir","instagram_id":"iammihirupadhyay","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2455,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ILQG2t3gDJZLhQVbQgAzCLHlU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1736}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2425,"name":"bodily disabled person"},{"id":9840,"name":"romance"},{"id":9673,"name":"love"},{"id":10703,"name":"tragic love"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"Tentative Release Date","release_date":"2022-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"The Blind Date - Trailer","key":"jmjoSuXz3CE","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-04-25T14:54:24.000Z","id":"629149c309ed8f00650a591a"}]}}}
