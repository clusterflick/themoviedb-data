In each village in this remote area of the world, there is a traditional Tibetan medicine man named the \"Amchi.\" Since the beginning of time, the Amchi has passed his knowledge down from father to son, or from teacher to student. With the construction of a new road, however, the valley was left vulnerable to the outside world. Since then, the younger generation has rejected the age-old wisdom and practices of the Amchi, embracing more modern, lucrative activities instead. As a result, these forgotten healers of the Himalayas are perhaps the last to practice Tibetan medicine.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amchis: The Forgotten Healers of the Himalayas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3566929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Samuel Ducoin","original_name":"Samuel Ducoin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6291bc1d76eecf005093951b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"himalaya film festival","release_date":"2003-10-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
