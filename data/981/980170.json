The opening minutes of the soundtrack evoke the surrounding nature: lapping water, clip-clopping horse hooves and leaves rustling in the wind. Then Graham dismounts to sing a song about a solitary man. At the end of the ballad, he gets back in the saddle and disappears into the tall grass, with his guitar on his back. In this film, the artist revisits the lonesome cowboy myth perpetuated in western movies and country music.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/Ao9aJvIYkXWPuq2nJFMu1kQkYPb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How I Became a Ramblin’ Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1936826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rodney Graham","original_name":"Rodney Graham","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"628f592a7f054000506c2793","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/Ao9aJvIYkXWPuq2nJFMu1kQkYPb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
