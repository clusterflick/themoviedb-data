One day she is reading a terrifying tale of anarchists. A foreign-looking man enters the office and asks to see her employer, who is out. He hands her a card and strangely enough bears the same name as the anarchist in her novel. She at once imagines him a nihilist. He is joined by a friend and together they look at the next office and rent it from Pearson, Lulu's employer. When they are gone, Lulu warns her boss, but he only laughs at her. It happens that Lulu's employer goes away for a day or two and leaves the office in her charge. This is her chance.","popularity":0.0643,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lulu's Anarchist","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1523891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hazel Neason","original_name":"Hazel Neason","popularity":0.0732,"profile_path":"/uPLHUBSouappjogIdTGcT1fGMFp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Lulu","credit_id":"62917e6a85b10500689637b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1386348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin R.
