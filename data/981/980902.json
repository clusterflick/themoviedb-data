Inspired by the life of T.E Lawrence, the film tells the epic story of the British officer who led, between 1916 and 1918, the rebellion of the Bedouin tribes against the Ottoman Empire. When the film is released at the very beginning of the 1960’s, Great-Britain and France are painfully withdrawing from their colonies, as Arab nationalism is experiencing a renaissance around the world. Five years after the French and British humiliating Suez expedition the film remains the proud, nostalgic counterpoint of political events of the 1950's when a British officer was encouraging Arab nationalism.","popularity":0.0747,"poster_path":"/ryhJOsaGI6Fx7U3wNO2pDE8WMmu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46356,"logo_path":"/gwaoRQcAzCmsKv1z6L4D2nr0DBB.png","name":"Folamour Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once Upon a Time...
