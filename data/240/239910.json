Each story explores what it means to belong to a specific community.  A Thousand Roads is a fictional work, produced by National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) to explore the human context of the NMAIâ€™s collections. The film is striking visually, and presents through its beauty and its stories an imaginative entry into knowing about Native people living in the vast indigenous geography that comprises the Americas. Rather than presenting a conventional historical perspective, the film is composed of short contemporary fictions about individuals, grounding them in emotional truths to which an audience can easily relate.","popularity":1.1747,"poster_path":"/rpUZFStSmTPCkVdmaoxme0NAA4P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mandalay
