The titular film is a holy fragment of celluloid that can only be seen by a secret society known as the Philokinetes. They watch it on a loop, somnambulating through a life that is unreal by comparison. It is the belief of the Philokinetes that film has an existence “independent from humans. Cinema, they said, is the primeval soup of a new life form. There from were to emerge pure screening creatures. Which is to say, non-topical beings.” - n+1","popularity":0.2395,"poster_path":"/gaQ52uuSRGAthwMLiRytZguaHJF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1997-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Film to Come","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raúl Ruiz","original_name":"Raúl Ruiz","popularity":0.2407,"profile_path":"/gsJkcICbmk1GCi3EkDkxE6qZcpe.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e93c3a36847f8299b49","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1187095,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jacques Bouquin","original_name":"Jacques Bouquin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac648cbc3a36834db00ff8b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":134464,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Valeria Sarmiento","original_name":"Valeria Sarmiento","popularity":0.0896,"profile_path":"/heyXSDnTvdX3wVLbfwE2Qtclf2S.jpg","credit_id":"5ac01ab7925141601b035dfd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121585,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Raúl Ruiz","original_name":"Raúl Ruiz","popularity":0.2407,"profile_path":"/gsJkcICbmk1GCi3EkDkxE6qZcpe.jpg","credit_id":"5ac164c6c3a3682d3500fb02","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134463,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jorge Arriagada","original_name":"Jorge Arriagada","popularity":0.0524,"profile_path":"/zf99gSiTF63GgOhRNYsEp4j8czk.jpg","credit_id":"5ac164dc925141601504d1da","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1090186,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Silvia Voser","original_name":"Silvia Voser","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ac164ed0e0a260c390108ea","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1311035","wikidata_id":"Q28860409","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oOUV0jlXovIVwLWLz72OxqBMkas.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":888,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/gaQ52uuSRGAthwMLiRytZguaHJF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":592}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: IMDB (Cinema Giovanni)","release_date":"1997-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
