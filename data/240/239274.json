The music can however be very important. Zwartjes composes it himself, sometimes together with his brother Rudolf and Lodewijk de Boer. Audition is a fine example of a Zwartjes film with an important soundtrack. It is a visual improvisation of cinematography and acting. There is hardly a ‘story line’. A man and a woman watch another woman singing, predominantly in exciting black and white images.","popularity":0.1034,"poster_path":"/pAA4rAtmitukgyTLiRilXsMOBV0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1973-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Audition","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":936550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Moniek Toebosch","original_name":"Moniek Toebosch","popularity":0.3131,"profile_path":"/pgFNuLM1jf5ilgUoeKRYdEP2pLP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c30bc460e0a260fc13d60bd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2244436,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tineke","original_name":"Tineke","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5dc60c2cab1bc70013007ee1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1127007,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Manders","original_name":"Christian Manders","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/s2qrECE19FfTUUCzM6pQBYu1tjy.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c30bc560e0a2655ee40af8b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1081524,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Frans Zwartjes","original_name":"Frans Zwartjes","popularity":0.0691,"profile_path":"/ajAuB9ADoBrabDNx9SwkUJZsCWL.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e90c3a36847f8298d2d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1995256","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pAA4rAtmitukgyTLiRilXsMOBV0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Festival international du cinéma en 16mm de Montréal","release_date":"1973-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"xx","note":"Festival of Independent Avant-Garde Film","release_date":"1973-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
