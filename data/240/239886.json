In 1957, Sauro, Luigi and Enzo all live in Alfonsine, a small town in Italy ruled like a miniature Soviet Union by the Italian Communist Party. As many communists in the West, they dream of the Soviet Union, and hope for the great Revolution. But with the wind of reform and self-criticism blowing through the Eastern Bloc after the death of Stalin the image of the Soviet Union as the workers’ paradise begins to crumble. They therefore decide to travel to the USSR to find out what is true and what is false in this supposed land of milk and honey. They film their entire journey with their 8mm camera. Through this invaluable personal archive, our film tells the hopes, disappointments and challenges of three young men faced with the reality of what seemed to be a utopia come true.","popularity":0.1159,"poster_path":"/f7yjxMrZUrZ7XfuEXSRykCqNBnI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58777,"logo_path":"/qzticUrKOrmrsjyehxNZVrX9JPs.png","name":"Kiné","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":121500,"logo_path":"/5uN88a9tHaFI7cVbvwTeZNFkBku.png","name":"Vezfilm","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":77407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Apapaja","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Train to Moscow","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"The Train to Moscow","type":"World-wide"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"The Train to Moscow- A Journey to Utopia","type":"Altrenative"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294488,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sauro Ravaglia","original_name":"Sauro Ravaglia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":23,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5304c18592514104c71d90f7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294482,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Andrea Vaccari","original_name":"Andrea Vaccari","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62977578d71fb416cb71a7ee","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1275000,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michele Manzolini","original_name":"Michele Manzolini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/p6kWxdqyVhPkiVkdNXw6Fi2sBeL.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e9bc3a36847f829c337","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1274999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federico Ferrone","original_name":"Federico Ferrone","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/iWjPNertlspitktCNsIm9A0vf6T.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e9bc3a36847f829c331","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294488,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Sauro Ravaglia","original_name":"Sauro Ravaglia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5304bd9a92514104c11a1d73","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294478,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Francesco Ragazzi","original_name":"Francesco Ragazzi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5304bc70c3a3683a89189796","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1161272,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sara Fgaier","original_name":"Sara Fgaier","popularity":0.0725,"profile_path":"/uUHkpgtTC6MJh4VBDEZeRYq4ZnK.jpg","credit_id":"5304be05c3a3683a8918d08e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294485,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Enzo Pasi","original_name":"Enzo Pasi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5304bd6f92514104c71ca455","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1274999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federico Ferrone","original_name":"Federico Ferrone","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/iWjPNertlspitktCNsIm9A0vf6T.jpg","credit_id":"5304bc2fc3a3683ab217ec35","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1294480,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Denver M.
