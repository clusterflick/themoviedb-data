It argues that the magic bullet that hit JFK and Governor John Connally was in fact possible. The documentary also features other home movies taken on the day.","popularity":0.531,"poster_path":"/vzQICVAfko1BRfVoZ7uSqqwoOgN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"JFK: The Lost Bullet","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2236537,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Max Holland","original_name":"Max Holland","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6293808f1e9225009cd1f336","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John F.
