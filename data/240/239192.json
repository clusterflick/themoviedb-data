Bud is reluctant to become her partner, as he has proven to himself to be unreliable in relationships, but he tells her to call him whenever she needs help. While working in a beer garden, Florette meets Hap Stanley, an avaricious performer who marries her to get the rights to perform her show routine. Hap dislikes Jimmy and eventually convinces Florette to send him away to school. Both Jimmy and Florette are broken-up over being apart, but Jimmy pretends it is what he wants so Florette can be happy with Hap.","popularity":1.1331,"poster_path":"/pK48cSjIsD70qu2TsYeA01f8Dmq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1934-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The pathos of \"Little Miss Marker\"...plus laughs that will roll you in the aisles!","title":"You Belong to Me","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33003,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Tracy","original_name":"Lee Tracy","popularity":0.2528,"profile_path":"/q0Pn5DD6xfziydu4rofX6pijK5F.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Bud Hannigan","credit_id":"52fe4e8ec3a36847f82984bf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Mack","original_name":"Helen Mack","popularity":0.2246,"profile_path":"/zHefRbs0wALGyzCoIhjf6WKfy8S.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Florette Faxon","credit_id":"52fe4e8ec3a36847f82984c3","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":145959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Morgan","original_name":"Helen Morgan","popularity":0.0952,"profile_path":"/psrgNK6RsqAUGDdcZX7NXJX6eKs.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bonnie Kay","credit_id":"52fe4e8ec3a36847f82984c7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":218536,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Holt","original_name":"David Holt","popularity":0.19,"profile_path":"/q47qQuScFp1wM7LeePs8jXE8qJo.jpg","cast_id":25,"character":"Jimmy Faxon","credit_id":"5c42b4100e0a26675719c22c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arthur Pierson","original_name":"Arthur Pierson","popularity":0.1405,"profile_path":"/b6JX8RiUlMUZtUmr1FnuzJb6Uhj.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Hap Stanley","credit_id":"52fe4e8ec3a36847f82984cf","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":102064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lynne Overman","original_name":"Lynne Overman","popularity":0.2267,"profile_path":"/8Rrh7yqDWhAskgPsNvR7sViBX3z.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Brown","credit_id":"52fe4e8ec3a36847f82984d3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dean Jagger","original_name":"Dean Jagger","popularity":0.6027,"profile_path":"/fgAzRigYun0yXqIdAYPUA4GViFq.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Military School Instructor","credit_id":"52fe4e8ec3a36847f82984d7","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":80994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Sheridan","original_name":"Ann Sheridan","popularity":0.4686,"profile_path":"/pAPqHCSn5Qmtr7QFbCJ2NwCUBBr.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Wedding Party Guest","credit_id":"52fe4e8ec3a36847f82984db","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33705,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edwin Stanley","original_name":"Edwin Stanley","popularity":0.1387,"profile_path":"/ezkjW2BKID76lEVDF56lPxPOykE.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Major Hurley -
