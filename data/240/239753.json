Since its discovery in 1844, generations of researchers have attempted to study it in the wild - but in vain. Although it proved possible to catch a few specimens for zoos, no one ever got to see them before they were already inside the trap. They eluded the gaze of the researchers like phantoms under the protection of the enchanted forest. These are the first ever pictures of pygmy hippopotami in their natural surroundings - the rain forest of West Africa. Set amid stories about their habitat, the film allows a first impression of this timid creature's life. While their ten-times heavier relatives are loud and gregarious and live in open stretches of water, the pygmy hippopotamus moves furtively through the thick undergrowth.","popularity":0.2776,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marco Polo Film AG","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Enchanted Forest of the Pygmy Hippopotamus","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"The Enchanted Forest of the Pygmy Hippo","type":"alternative title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Susan Tackenberg","original_name":"Susan Tackenberg","popularity":0.1059,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Host","credit_id":"52fe4e99c3a36847f829b8ad","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":55741,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Klaus Scheurich","original_name":"Klaus Scheurich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e99c3a36847f829b8b3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":55741,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Klaus Scheurich","original_name":"Klaus Scheurich","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e99c3a36847f829b8b9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274787,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Annette Scheurich","original_name":"Annette Scheurich","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e99c3a36847f829b8bf","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274786,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bernd Curschmann","original_name":"Bernd Curschmann","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e99c3a36847f829b8c5","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274793,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Gudrun Szilágyi","original_name":"Gudrun Szilágyi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e99c3a36847f829b8cb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274787,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Annette Scheurich","original_name":"Annette Scheurich","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e99c3a36847f829b8d1","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274794,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Armin Riegel","original_name":"Armin Riegel","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e99c3a36847f829b8d7","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274797,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jürgen Offermann","original_name":"Jürgen Offermann","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e99c3a36847f829b8dd","department":"Sound","job":"Sound mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274799,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Horst Abel","original_name":"Horst Abel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e99c3a36847f829b8e3","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274800,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Andrea Lucca","original_name":"Andrea Lucca","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e99c3a36847f829b8e9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274801,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Winfred Staschau","original_name":"Winfred Staschau","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e99c3a36847f829b8ef","department":"Editing","job":"Color Timer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274803,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Wolf Lengwenus","original_name":"Wolf Lengwenus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e99c3a36847f829b8f5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2509,"name":"hippopotamus"},{"id":8969,"name":"pygmy"},{"id":10787,"name":"jungle"},{"id":18330,"name":"nature"},{"id":188316,"name":"hippo"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1998-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Rare Video Footage of a Pygmy Hippo in Tai Forest, Ivory Coast - Part 2","key":"N5xG8aSZsko","published_at":"2010-03-04T08:59:19.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"533ec723c3a368544800b834"}]}}}
