Upon arriving stateside, the detective finds that Bandit has is in jail. Now, in order to track down Massive and Vincent, the loose-cannon lawman springs Bandit from the pen, and hits the streets. The harder Detective Colonel Stevens pushes bandit to lead him to the jewels, however, the more the wily outlaw works to steer the cop awry.
