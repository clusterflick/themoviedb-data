Shot like a grungy medical documentary, Smolders and co-director Thierry Knauff intercut shots of several children at a Belgium psychiatric clinic.  The kids are shown with forlorn expressions, twicthing their eyes, sometimes smiling, shaking, jumping, rocking their heads side to side, or smacking their heads with horrific glee against walls. It's a minimalist work that captures the intense monotony of lost and disturbed young minds, and maintains a gritty intensity. - kqek.com","popularity":0.1427,"poster_path":"/bbYC0U5LFM7COaSOfycyu1uiZNm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seuls","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1274373,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thierry Knauff","original_name":"Thierry Knauff","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e93c3a36847f8299db5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Olivier Smolders","original_name":"Olivier Smolders","popularity":0.0672,"profile_path":"/6ooRv43skUxgaAD0k1oT3gE1M9y.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e93c3a36847f8299daf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0423149","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bbYC0U5LFM7COaSOfycyu1uiZNm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Source: MUBI (IFFR)","release_date":"1989-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
