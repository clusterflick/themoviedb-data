Interviews with former members of Eoan, photos, newspaper clippings, sound recordings, archive footage of opera performances and street scenes featuring the residents of District 6 in Cape Town give an impression of the world in which these people lived. By paying attention to the way in which the documentary was made – to questions that were not asked and answers that were not officially given – the painful truth behind the images and faces is gradually revealed.","popularity":0.0634,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Inconsolable Memory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1142409,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aryan Kaganof","original_name":"Aryan Kaganof","popularity":0.0484,"profile_path":"/rUElkeHdGyUXje2Sl0ubwWNRKOj.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4e95c3a36847f829a409","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
