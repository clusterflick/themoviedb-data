Smolders has basically taken a standard documentary and chopped it up, using quotes from the long-dead artist, and periodic statements by a historian (Smolders) filling in a few bits of Wiertz’ life.","popularity":0.6441,"poster_path":"/oDWYpp1CdqJzw7tOxISlRU5Aan1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de la
