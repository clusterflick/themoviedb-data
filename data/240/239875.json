In a poetic farewell ritual or rite of passage that takes place in intimate, dark spaces, they reflect on their bond with one another and how their characters relate to each other. In a mirror, their two faces seem to melt into one, but also flip out of sync when Niels expresses his great desire to be with Carl, while Carl maintains that he doesn't miss Niels that much. Declarations of love and pain follow one another. Gradually, the characters and desires of the young men shine through. A film about competition, sharing life, saying farewell and defining who you are without the other.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/mStV8EuqicmGPamw8tld0wCTakq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carl & Niels","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Plum","original_name":"Carl Plum","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"63ffae8841a56100855b8d88","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3944604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Niels Plum","original_name":"Niels Plum","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"63ffae8d9653f600894eb145","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Lind","original_name":"Alexander Lind","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"63ffae94cf62cd007ba76d02","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1274995,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Lind","original_name":"Alexander Lind","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4e9bc3a36847f829c231","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3606702","wikidata_id":"Q20728278","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.674,"height":1484,"iso_639_1":"da","file_path":"/mStV8EuqicmGPamw8tld0wCTakq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
