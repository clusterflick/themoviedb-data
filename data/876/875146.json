With its salty water over thick, black mud, Western Europeâ€™s largest lagoon is just the right sanctuary for their annual reproduction cycle. Few places like this still remain because they are vulnerable ecosystems. We accompany the bird colony while they raise their offspring. Many dangers threaten this exhausting challenge but in the end the young birds leave behind their grey childhood plumage and learn to fly. The long nomadic flight of the Phoenix begins again.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/h41372dsvDfJT7j0A76MnUzstDo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135690,"logo_path":null,"name":"COM4HD","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Long Flight of the Phoenix","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.78,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/7U36Ucp6Ifl1jDDGNrQh4bbCang.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3560}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2880,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/h41372dsvDfJT7j0A76MnUzstDo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
