With the disappearance of their estranged brother, Mehitable and Jerusha are the only demons left to look after the “family business” of terrorizing humans in their dreams. The otherworldly veil lifts one day as Mehitable flees home and attempts to create a new life alongside humanity. Booger serves as a queer supernatural coming-of-age story, for anyone who has felt like an Other, an outcast, or uncomfortable in their own skin.","popularity":0.0884,"poster_path":"/1tJ4fvjieKrkJiekavGvoIUDNPl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164581,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malicious Wallydrags","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The boogeyman is real.","title":"Booger","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3311590,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mason Bennett","original_name":"Mason Bennett","popularity":0.0502,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Mehitable Pachad","credit_id":"61936018f85958008fc8154e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3311591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katelyn Orcahrd","original_name":"Katelyn Orcahrd","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Jerusha Pachad","credit_id":"619360216ca9a0009417925b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3311593,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Finn Taylor","original_name":"Finn Taylor","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Samael Pachad","credit_id":"6193602b498bc2002471d44c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2360486,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amber Sayman","original_name":"Amber Sayman","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Banshee","credit_id":"6193603701757f0060f5ca7b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3311594,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cleo Smith","original_name":"Cleo Smith","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Macy Gibbs","credit_id":"619360421f748b00292f5fe2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2360483,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Austin Barnett","original_name":"Austin Barnett","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Evan Gibbs","credit_id":"6193605001757f002c96e389","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3311595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Ponsford","original_name":"Julian Ponsford","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Jason","credit_id":"6193605f498bc2006435df3d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3311596,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Lykins","original_name":"Sarah Lykins","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Lilith","credit_id":"6193606c724de10044fa4aa9","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3311597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Reazen McAvoy","original_name":"Reazen McAvoy","popularity":0.0658,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Steve","credit_id":"619360d0c4ad59008c7eba25","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3311598,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ambrose Atalaya","original_name":"Ambrose Atalaya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Soothsayer","credit_id":"619360f0c4ad59008c7eba33","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2360482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Millena Saul","original_name":"Rachel Millena Saul","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vzVMe2K5bVxx8aDPJ856QrbJfgb.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Soothsayer","credit_id":"619360fb87ae7b001eb8d7bb","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2360488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonah Barnett","original_name":"Jonah Barnett","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/iRg92yIqH4AOxMsIL6itsjNKBYi.jpg","credit_id":"614762409f0e19008f631df6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2360482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Millena Saul","original_name":"Rachel Millena Saul","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vzVMe2K5bVxx8aDPJ856QrbJfgb.jpg","credit_id":"619361193e2ec8002ada8195","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2360488,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jonah Barnett","original_name":"Jonah Barnett","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/iRg92yIqH4AOxMsIL6itsjNKBYi.jpg","credit_id":"6193610d75f1ad0029d8b4a7","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9229946","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1XkwTEE05QZV0yGg19IeFa2LCRJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1012,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1tJ4fvjieKrkJiekavGvoIUDNPl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
