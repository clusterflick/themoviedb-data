It arrives as a diplomatic envoy from New York’s art and film worlds of the sixties – an alternative cinema informed by Minimalism and Happenings, materializations of art as experience projected on Snow’s trademark Walking Woman.  \"Little Walk\" is a dynamic, 12-min silent loop that embodies the experimental nature characterizing the artist's works during that decade. From 1961 to 1967, Snow centred his artistic endeavours across all mediums around the naturalistic outline of a youthful woman. Initially crafted from a cardboard cut-out, the walking woman's image evolved into both the instrument and focal point of Snow's creative expression. \"Little Walk,\" was created for an exhibition curated by Jonas Mekas called \"Expanded Cinema.\" Originally captured on 8mm film, the piece has since been transferred to DVD.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/2yv2h8tiuNFT3wA1FhvhqCpaLm1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Walk","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":936169,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Snow","original_name":"Michael Snow","popularity":0.0638,"profile_path":"/j03LNEftQoFpTD2irj9MdhWPUgo.jpg","credit_id":"6144c252ed28b9008e9fa18c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/hnjiry7PdWeyMpx1zJaVYZAcu00.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2yv2h8tiuNFT3wA1FhvhqCpaLm1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1964-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
