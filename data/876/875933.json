He teamed up with friends to follow Dr Sun, traversing provinces for several years and filming precious historical moments such as Sun's inspection of the country and the Northern Expedition led by Chiang Kai-shek after the death of Sun. Some of those footage was edited into A Page of History, available to the public today, albeit deteriorated and incomplete. The Battle of Shanghai records the famous conflict at the beginning of the war in 1937 when, fervently resisting the invading Japanese army, 800 soldiers defended a warehouse until the very last moment. Shot by Lai and his team at the risk of death, the film is now an invaluable visual document in Chinese modern history.","popularity":0.7705,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":161180,"logo_path":null,"name":"China Sun (Shanghai)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1937-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Battle of Shanghai","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3239989,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Chu Shu-hong","original_name":"Chu Shu-hong","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614763c9daf57c008abecd10","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3032598,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Lai Man-Wai","original_name":"Lai Man-Wai","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614763b2609750002a433af2","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2275805,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Changlin Xu","original_name":"Changlin Xu","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/uZWr5eqnafWVSgNB6JxpwsqqLLI.jpg","credit_id":"614763beb5bc21002d282767","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3239986,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lai Buk-hoi","original_name":"Lai Buk-hoi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614763a5c2823a0044dd3c89","department":"Editing","job":"Project Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1956,"name":"world war ii"},{"id":10535,"name":"second sino-japanese war (1937-45)"},{"id":285170,"name":"battle of shanghai"},{"id":285172,"name":"stalingrad on the yangtze"},{"id":285173,"name":"republic of china"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"1937-08-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
