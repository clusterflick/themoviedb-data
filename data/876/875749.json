It toys with the idea of ethnicity, race and origins, mixed with transgender, straight, gay, bisexual and queer identities. Genders, races and sexual orientations combine themselves and the lines get blurry. Differences become similarities. The film was purposefully shot on a old VHS camera, to allude to vintage, family home videos.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/96c8dqr2vzAwZUwEOuKk208QlgJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are Family","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"WeAreFamily","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2284601,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Germain Choffart","original_name":"Germain Choffart","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gYGcDlkV0yAB29DJMJJwM23uN2s.jpg","credit_id":"6146ac82ca835400260c6fce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6680308","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.699,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/96c8dqr2vzAwZUwEOuKk208QlgJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":524}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2017-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
