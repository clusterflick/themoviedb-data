Taking the audience through this attempt to bend time and form connections, the film uses footage from Los Angeles and New York to analyze how spaces can hold memories, even after people are gone. \"Temporal\" is narrated by an omniscient voice that guides the audience through this ambitious attempt to blur the lines of past and present.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/1xvjX8xSUu5NoNSf6TR2XKRE2t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Temporal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2119932,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jackson Bollinger","original_name":"Jackson Bollinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6146d23d511d090043e4db5d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8278138","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/1xvjX8xSUu5NoNSf6TR2XKRE2t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
