Zabeta is an exploration of stereotype and alienation, and a small personal historical archive of patriarchy, sexism, education, conflict and religion in Greece, investigating how they affect us even to this day. The documentary questions narrative as it oscillates between reality and scripted reality, filmed as our grandmother would have filmed it.","popularity":0.0404,"poster_path":"/iERsYQ6etHXnczZjlpKPAxXbzFB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2021-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zabeta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3239375,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Betty Dafi","original_name":"Betty Dafi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"61467fb2daf57c004366b79c","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3239371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elissavet Sfyri","original_name":"Elissavet Sfyri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61467f6a22df2e0093037729","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3239372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sofia Sfyri","original_name":"Sofia Sfyri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61467f87efd3c20043a46957","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3239372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sofia Sfyri","original_name":"Sofia Sfyri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61467f9a048638002ce701f0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3239372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sofia Sfyri","original_name":"Sofia Sfyri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61467f7cdaf57c008abd5c6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3239374,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Adrian Trikas-Pandis","original_name":"Adrian Trikas-Pandis","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61467fa5e55937002993b4ec","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3239371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elissavet Sfyri","original_name":"Elissavet Sfyri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61467f55b5bc21008ce6681a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3239371,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elissavet Sfyri","original_name":"Elissavet Sfyri","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61467f61daf57c00610050e0","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3239372,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sofia Sfyri","original_name":"Sofia Sfyri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61467f909f0e19008f61b973","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1439,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iERsYQ6etHXnczZjlpKPAxXbzFB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":959}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
