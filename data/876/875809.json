They must decide whether to cover up the mess they've found themselves in or buck up and follow through with coming out as a couple. We Don't Have Gays in Ghana is a cooky, irreverent comedy with heart that uses humor to tackle the issues of intercultural relationships, Western preconceived notions about Africa, and the effects of hyper-religious viewpoints toward queer people in Africa.","popularity":0.0604,"poster_path":"/cWVCZEm13ojUmURun2GPMfaqMWT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Don't Have Gays in Ghana","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3232080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Feight","original_name":"Jeremy Feight","popularity":0.083,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6146ea35ca8354008ed7ae4b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8018992","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cWVCZEm13ojUmURun2GPMfaqMWT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GH","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-11-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
