Speeding away on a motorcycle, he brings the fighter back to his homeland in Romove, a holy Baltic site. There is about to be a wedding, but the preparations are interrupted by ravens. Their black feathers are a mirror for Daumants’ conscience and act as a reminder of his crime against Jargala, a girl he raped and killed. Soon Daumants falls in battle, and being a stranger in Romove, Baņuta is caught up in sacrificial rituals and revenge. However, she is strong-willed and will not bow to fate – no one will take her happiness away.  A hundred years after the premiere of Alfrēds Kalniņš’ first Latvian opera Baņuta in 1920, comes the opera film Baņuta – an international project that melds opera, musical performances, the conditionality of the performing arts and contemporary performativity.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/tneb5D9OY3IOZJKnM6nzakm2k4Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2021-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":154,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baņuta","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2528545,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Grecka","original_name":"Laura Grecka","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"616b041cbe2d4900635cb1fe","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sniedze Kaņepe","original_name":"Sniedze Kaņepe","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"616b042a5a9915002dad5788","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273308,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Brauna","original_name":"Angela Brauna","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"616b0438037264009578bbb3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3237978,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Franziska Kronfoth","original_name":"Franziska Kronfoth","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6144a327aaf897002a082830","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273306,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alfrēds Kalniņš","original_name":"Alfrēds Kalniņš","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616b03de924ce6008d0b758a","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273306,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Alfrēds Kalniņš","original_name":"Alfrēds Kalniņš","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616b03ea6f53e100259040ff","department":"Writing","job":"Opera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1198971,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jēkabs Nīmanis","original_name":"Jēkabs Nīmanis","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/57bpxKBIBmyLfH1xB2OOoOerWnn.jpg","credit_id":"616b07596bdec300908c7fe9","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273530,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Marta Kontiņa","original_name":"Marta Kontiņa","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616b2c6f53866e00680de557","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3273532,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Evarts Melnalksnis","original_name":"Evarts Melnalksnis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616b2c86158c850096bcc5b1","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2601550,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ieva Stade","original_name":"Ieva Stade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616b2ca26f53e100649425da","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2165805,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Toms Šķēle","original_name":"Toms Šķēle","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"616b2eacd43f0100421e214b","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt19063658","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"OperfilmaBanuta","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.779,"height":804,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qRDR2xDLwoubtqlkLDu4ht9GiAZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1430}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":2037,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tneb5D9OY3IOZJKnM6nzakm2k4Z.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1361},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1617,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iRSSb9mH5yeYBhpM9nlWqjZ80ch.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1079}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Riga IFF","release_date":"2021-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
