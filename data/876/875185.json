Saratchandran who travelled constantly with the camera and cinemas. As someone who pioneered in media activism as part of the little magazine movement during the Emergency, Sarat later on took up the very political duty of documenting the popular struggle movements of Kerala. This film tries to be exactly that, a clear take on the popular risings of not just Kerala, but the whole of India, by exploring and coordinating the history of those who have travelled along with Sarat. Sarat, who remained wide awake in both at the struggle fronts and in his personal relationships; for someone as unconditionally empathetic, the camera was always the third eye for fulfilling his mission; the third eye of resistance.","popularity":0.0239,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Third Eye of Resistance","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1838722,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Razi Muhammed","original_name":"Razi Muhammed","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6144aabd1b70ae002b179305","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3039272","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
