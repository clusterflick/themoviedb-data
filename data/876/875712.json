It is intimate in style, very carefully filmed, with a wealth of practical information about the material culture and structure of Ju/'hoan (!Kung Bushmen) hunter-gatherer society. The film allows viewers to see some of John Marshall's earliest film footage and provides an interesting comparison with the more sophisticated shooting found in his later work.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28620,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documentary Educational Resources","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"First Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3239415,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lorna Marshall","original_name":"Lorna Marshall","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61468db485c0a200897c6a05","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183617,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Marshall","original_name":"John Marshall","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/aN1Rt8npcoqDNiQsnz8Iis0WYCN.jpg","credit_id":"655a55b467dcc9011de5b774","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
