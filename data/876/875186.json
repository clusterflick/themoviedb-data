A desperate woman has turned to the police asking for help to find her daughter, Anna. She is 21 years old, is getting good grades at the Krasnoyarsk State Pedagogical University and has been missing for three days. On the same day, a man arrives at the police station because he has found a phone in the forest while walking his dog. It turns out that the smartphone with the Instagram account “Muha_v_komnate” belongs to the missing girl. The stories that Anna’s family members, friends and those close to her tell clash, leading the chief investigator to question whether anyone ever really knew the girl.","popularity":0.1321,"poster_path":"/neOFHIfcgHxc73qwxU0JoTxMXCA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2021-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1078035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andris Keišs","original_name":"Andris Keišs","popularity":0.1738,"profile_path":"/7ycuAovV8wFC6oiAMsAIF5GL6ou.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6144ae7a5e12000020b1fc8c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1207120,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guna Zariņa","original_name":"Guna Zariņa","popularity":0.1042,"profile_path":"/bokJ2mxfyday2P989bf627T9Q6f.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6144ae82ed28b900626502c8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1336219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valentin Novopolskij","original_name":"Valentin Novopolskij","popularity":0.156,"profile_path":"/5rrZsUMtP9qrgCeUxZg8Pu6Zhjo.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6144ae9c048638002ce2d6b2","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1597053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liena Šmukste","original_name":"Liena Šmukste","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/zGhXeRgBkgRjWhPsZwjf56DhYsx.jpg","credit_id":"6144ae7055c926004455f337","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/neOFHIfcgHxc73qwxU0JoTxMXCA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Riga IFF","release_date":"2021-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
