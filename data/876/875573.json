He investigates why a new trade border in the Irish Sea has led to violent protests, sparking fear among some of a return to conflict, nearly 25 years after the end of the Troubles; a conflict which claimed thousands of lives, including that of his father Jack Kielty.  In this very personal film, Patrick’s focus is on a new generation born long after the ceasefire, as he tries to understand what is driving this new wave of unrest, particularly in loyalist communities. He also explores why some feel that a united Ireland could now be on the horizon and how the trauma of Northern Ireland’s past is shaping its future","popularity":0.1948,"poster_path":"/uHtTduqEWqnO8Y6mEbpSZs9JzbS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Patrick Kielty: One Hundred Years of Union","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":216280,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Kielty","original_name":"Patrick Kielty","popularity":0.1186,"profile_path":"/maczg3drzP6RVvZddESjj8NwjBr.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"6197a55c9512e10043d3c875","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2873167,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Natalie Maynes","original_name":"Natalie Maynes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"680b6f0215a1d5a614ab6b35","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.68,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uHtTduqEWqnO8Y6mEbpSZs9JzbS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":680}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
