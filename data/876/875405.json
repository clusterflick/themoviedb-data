But, above all, Venice is unique for its identity as a city of oxymorons, holding together opposing DNA in a formidable contradiction: the allure of decadence, and the frenzy of the avant-garde. VENEZIA-INFINITA AVANGUARDIA is a labyrinth of stories, works of art, palaces, celebrities of social and cultural life, places, extravagances, and traditions. It's a sensory experience made of lights, water, and music. Beside connections and suggestions, testaments flow by of art historians, urbanists, sociologists, philosophers, curators, musicians, writers, journalists, artists, and our contemporaries.","popularity":0.1246,"poster_path":"/tyW8YDfCXcRctSA4xJln6Fi66q3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"1600 years from its foundation, the Cinema celebrates Venice","title":"Venice: Infinitely Avant-Garde","video":false,"vote_average":6.938,"vote_count":8,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2134310,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michele Mally","original_name":"Michele Mally","popularity":0.0804,"profile_path":"/pxCkqpUfADUfLiRtOLeeMTJFt4H.jpg","credit_id":"614591d4aaf897008c123473","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt21622672","wikidata_id":"Q132048460","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/t2A7qKSj7Mt73A6q33BXIIL0YBQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tITEGgj54LntGBp6dVVhO0UcKMB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3378},{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1688,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/adU3n1owQYHd8jm6GMNwRkk2iSA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3000}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":4.179,"height":879,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/oFqaqozGMcx5bfPnRp21lJbShHu.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3673}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2362,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/tyW8YDfCXcRctSA4xJln6Fi66q3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1654},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"cs","file_path":"/fuUl9qXiXQ3qYX5htWtAY8DqavN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/6BAPgGAmLXRdeXQTQicWpzaCYDR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"TP","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-08-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"T","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
