But he cannot fool the dog, and so aggressive does the animal become that the girl's mother gives it to a passing farmer. The girl is forced to accept the contractor's attentions, notwithstanding that she has a favored suitor, a young man of the town. In desperation she runs away, intending to join her lover, but on the road she is overtaken by the contractor, who brings word that the dog has been badly hurt and may not live. Anxiety over her pet disarms her suspicions, and she enters the schemer's motor car. Her suitor sees her struggling with the abductor, boards a trolley car, and overtaking the automobile, leaps into it to fight for his love.","popularity":0.2898,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At the Road's End","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33776,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Mulhall","original_name":"Jack Mulhall","popularity":0.3,"profile_path":"/4r33PICmACJZ2Bjum0v1EkvOxbx.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Boy","credit_id":"61462b602dffd80045c70949","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1633862,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isabel Rea","original_name":"Isabel Rea","popularity":0.0538,"profile_path":"/rx5q7CTT6RMSSkP1q8wXJotupen.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"The Girl","credit_id":"61462b72e559370061765201","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1420993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hector V.
