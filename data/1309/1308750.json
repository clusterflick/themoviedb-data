This is a film about friendship and purpose in masters athletics, a place where every five years, getting older means becoming the youngest. Younger follows a group of female athletes in their 60s, 70s and 80s over the course of a year as they prepare to compete in masters competitions. In these competitions, athletes compete in age groups that span five years, 60-64, 65-69 etc. When an athlete moves up an age group they are then the youngest, and this means they are more likely to win or break records. So, as they approach the top end of their classification, they look forward to being a year older and moving up to the next group where they will be the new kid on the block again.","popularity":0.507,"poster_path":"/a7FAOgrBPBUxP5tcsJBfIOCl13Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":232153,"logo_path":null,"name":"Find It Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2024-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Younger: Looking Forward to Getting Older","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4793715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danielle Sellwood","original_name":"Danielle Sellwood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667a77269a23912519e4607b","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4793716,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alex Rotas","original_name":"Alex Rotas","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667a769b40874107338a709a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4793715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danielle Sellwood","original_name":"Danielle Sellwood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667a771c10d7e35f07e45658","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4793715,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Danielle Sellwood","original_name":"Danielle Sellwood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667a768f9920ecafaa57401f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"@younger_film","twitter_id":"@D_Sellwood"},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a7FAOgrBPBUxP5tcsJBfIOCl13Q.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1080}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":4995,"name":"aging"},{"id":309328,"name":"documentary short"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3},{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Younger - Looking Forward to Getting Older.
