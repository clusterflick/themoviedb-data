When he was just a child, he and his father walked thousands of kilometres from Valencia to the Pyrenees in order to survive. He was writing his memoirs for a while but had to abandon them because it affected him so much to remember his life. Now, 75 years later, we're going to walk the same route together, using cinema to try to bring out the memories that are stuck in his head and try to get him to finish writing his book.","popularity":0.198,"poster_path":"/sacmmIFucShEolyOVekfVrFXOFB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152580,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inaudita","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2024-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The
