The camera traces facades of communist housing blocks, depressingly unchanged over the years, as the transcript from the trial of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife, Elena, is read without pause or emotion. The intensity of the film is created by the tension between the dizzying and unceasing movement of the camera and the continuous and expressionless reading of the trial script, recording a very dark episode of modern history. — Anthology Film Archives","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/wOIma14tRE4b99kOa91C0tN1xsy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trial","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2756967,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Florin Tudor","original_name":"Florin Tudor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667847c7ebeacafd58f3fa28","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2756968,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mona Vatamanu","original_name":"Mona Vatamanu","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667847be1daf2dc34a3e6eb0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wOIma14tRE4b99kOa91C0tN1xsy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
