Motivated by the context of political revolutions in Central America, Viviana nurtures a strong interest in social justice and becomes involved in radical political organizing. To the surprise of those closest to her, Viviana is accused of participating in a shootout and murdering several police officers. While awaiting trial and unprotected in a cell, she is shot dead by a police officer.
