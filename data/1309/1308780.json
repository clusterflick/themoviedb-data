Besides its presence as a reminder of nature, it is also a source of health for the Sofia citizens.  Clear air comes down from above; we climb it – tourists, skiers. It is an incredible experience to ski on a beautiful, sunny winter day on its slopes, on Cherny Vruh – Vitosha's highest peak.  Vitosha is dangerously close to the expanding capital Sofia. Its status as a protected area is threatened by secret arrangements between oligarchs and governing politicians. Construction is going on even at the foot of the Vitosha Mountain.  \"When stupidity meets big money, monsters are born!\" – told us one of the heroes of the movie. Paradoxically, it is this conflict that provoked the most sensitive part of the generation of the transition, so that it will form the civil society in Bulgaria.","popularity":0.0445,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vitosha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3524890","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
