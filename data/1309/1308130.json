Those who transgress it reconstruct these imaginary lines on a daily basis, redefining the traditional geography and occupying the non-spaces where others live in a temporary form of existence. These others, the non-citizens, are phantasmtic, exchangeable parts of a flexible market. Made invisible, they are permanently controlled persons. Under the pretext of a greater civilian security, they are kept clear from the public spaces reserved for the citizens with rights and pushed into non-public spaces, which are run by state and military surveillance, multinational operations servicing a European market and non-governmental organisations.","popularity":0.7585,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":232037,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Maquina Vegetariana de Picar Carne y Pandeajo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Southern Border","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4790640,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Víctor Rins","original_name":"Víctor Rins","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667845e08c80ba3cc9b0b4da","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4790638,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Àlex Muñoz","original_name":"Àlex Muñoz","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6678458f37cdaf14803b26a7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4790639,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helena Maleno","original_name":"Helena Maleno","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6678459c4da254c043f252c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":514,"name":"spain"},{"id":1629,"name":"morocco"},{"id":1729,"name":"migration"},{"id":11933,"name":"conflict"},{"id":212815,"name":"arab stereotype"},{"id":235003,"name":"andalusia, spain"},{"id":256478,"name":"ethnic conflict"},{"id":330881,"name":"borders"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
