The film follows two extras who are preparing to play the role of policemen. Steve and Eric Cohen, the identical twins who play the two police officers, are both professional extras. Dressed in their police uniforms, the men aimlessly walk around the park and talk about how they should act as policemen, how theyâ€™re supposed to move, talk and look. Referencing Hollywood films, the characters are copies of a copy, a type of mise-en-abyme.","popularity":0.2632,"poster_path":"/GmwVVULnz2RwXCkMbERc2vhJQT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Cops","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3353954,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Cohen","original_name":"Steve Cohen","popularity":0.0635,"profile_path":"/cVa8C9Q3dWKHq4f1Kv5L384947n.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Cop 1","credit_id":"667abd8efae09751713b63dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2053313,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Cohen","original_name":"Eric Cohen","popularity":0.145,"profile_path":"/dVCXwjXvKE7lyQTcXr6mOqWXcaB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Cop 2","credit_id":"667abda0211446f544567e20","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2087185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tova Mozard","original_name":"Tova Mozard","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":"/pMFDZ0emEpHwDY0r6EGOnA03FIZ.jpg","credit_id":"667abdda98f56549ce8be55e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/GmwVVULnz2RwXCkMbERc2vhJQT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Experimental Art Space 1646","release_date":"2019-09-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
