It's animated and has the style of a period and cultural refinement that we love. It has the soft palette of an Impressionist painting. I remember the grey in Nai Nai's hair and could smell the tea and dessert that was brought to her. The tone was so right. The pacing made it so exciting and cut to black when she has a backflash and emotional experience in her past to forgive. Very beautiful film and very well directed and animated.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nai Nai","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
