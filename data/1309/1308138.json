News reports, for instance, were allowed to show the face of Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein’s president, but could not broadcast his voice. To get around this, actors were hired to lip sync Adams’s words. Featuring interviews with Adams, journalists, and one of Adams’s myriad “voices,” IRISH VOICES is a unique introduction into the media war that was part of the Irish struggle. — Anthology Film Archives","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Irish Voices","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2046745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur MacCaig","original_name":"Arthur MacCaig","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"667849e1877f16d693f3f84c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
