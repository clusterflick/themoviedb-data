There was a fortification that shortly afterwards was set on fire by Indians. Later, the stormy expansion of a settlement began, which became a center of immigrant workers, classical industry, and slaughterhouses (Bertolt Brecht) and, in 1941, military armaments. The Windy City on Lake Michigan is the fastest changing city in the world. The time-lapse shots with the 35mm Arriflex film camera are commented on by classic techno cuts and information about the tunnels under Chicago, the slaughterhouses, organized crime, the Sears and Roebuck catalogs, and other features of this strange city.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chicago in Time Lapse","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
