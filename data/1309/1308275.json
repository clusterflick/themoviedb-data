The film required a lot more diligence due to having specific rules. The rules for this structural film were based on the height of the camera and pixelation. The theme of the film was surveillance. While creating this film, there was an increased police presence and as an Afro-Indigenous woman, it was probably one of the more horrifying experiences. I considered it extremely alarming so I focused on sound to create a soundscape that sounded similar to surveillance. My intended goal for the audience’s reaction was to feel the tension that is felt.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4068537,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anpa’o Locke","original_name":"Anpa’o Locke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6678b96a4da254c043f25999","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2020-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
