As NPCs during epoch-making events that are incoherent but full of affect and memetics? Tragedy is indifferent to geography. This video essay employs a visual and textual language that responds to the current threat of extinction. This type of compact metalanguage emerges as a by-product of new technologies such as deep learning and neural nets. Narrated by a disarticulate AI egregore, FIRST PHONE plays like a more-than-human stream of consciousness, laying in sharp relief  a reality that decenters humans in its imaginary. The video draws parallels between the indifferent machine and Red Sea hostilities of political and ecological nature, coming to grips with a world plunged deep in the era of chaos.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/xWZ2QWtrn0UboKsUq6p7nuKMmc5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"first phone","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4488939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ruba Al Sweel","original_name":"Ruba Al Sweel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66781b17dc4f279b5df21f1c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xWZ2QWtrn0UboKsUq6p7nuKMmc5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
