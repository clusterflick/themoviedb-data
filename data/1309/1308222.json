Filmmaker, modern dancer and choreographer, Keith Glassman, follows his passion to explore the lives of a racially diverse, intergenerational group of celebrated men who have made their mark on and off the stage. Some of our most treasured dancers and choreographers, including Kennedy Center honoree, BILL T. JONES, Alvin Ailey Associate Artistic Director, MATTHEW RUSHING, Guggenheim Fellow, LAR LUBOVITCH and MacArthur Genius, KYLE ABRAHAM, gift us a rare level of transparency and expressionism as they share their sacrifices, triumphs and struggles to transcend economic, racial and sexual marginalization. From the park bench to the Broadway stage, LIVES BEYOND MOTION uncovers rare performances, the legacy of legendary artists and spotlights the uncompromising quest to find individual expression and joy in the art of movement.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lives Beyond Motion","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt29763764","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
