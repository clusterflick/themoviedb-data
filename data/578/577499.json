Written in 1745, Belshazzar stands with Messiah as one of Handel s finest efforts in the genre. Based on a libretto by Charles Jennens, the story, from the book of Daniel, recounts the fall of Babylon at the hands of the Persian prince Cyrus who brought Belshazzar s tyrannical reign to an end an eternally relevant story with significant current resonance. Featured soloists include countertenor Bejun Mehta, a rising star in the world s opera houses and concert halls.","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/4HNRvzNZ517wVxavNQUZRnR5ydP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":166,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Handel: Belshazzar","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1466272,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bejun Mehta","original_name":"Bejun Mehta","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/xwgKSgcwok0pPNyiA4bpiIwi8AF.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4975499251410e2255690a","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2289,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4HNRvzNZ517wVxavNQUZRnR5ydP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1526}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-06-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
