Far from being a leisure activity, for many of the pickers this is a main source of income which they and their families rely on to get by. In makeshift campsites, they spend months between dense coniferous forests and the Transalpina road, where they sell the gathered mushrooms to passing tourists or people on weekend breaks. The majority of their harvest is taken by intermediaries, who sell the mushrooms abroad for many times the price.","popularity":0.3272,"poster_path":"/l2YpUsFy4ivDbaeabiQydxsRmP4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113815,"logo_path":"/zXorvkMUtmzF2LBhp8k81faxOTz.png","name":"Fünferfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":154,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Olanda","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2581346,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ileana
