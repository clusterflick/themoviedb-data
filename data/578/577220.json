There aren't many details offered for this very short Hepworth picture -- the copy I saw timed in at 20 seconds. The camerawork is ascribed to Cecil Hepworth, and it is certainly possible, even though he had other people working for him at the time. Neither is the event or the exact release date given, but I think it likely it was shot during the celebration of the coronation of King Edward VII.","popularity":0.0306,"poster_path":"/NGoi4RUMpDptQKN0snPTPjo3kZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24148,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hepworth","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1902-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Indian Review: Grand March Past","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2726042","wikidata_id":"Q15845690","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/NGoi4RUMpDptQKN0snPTPjo3kZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1902-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
