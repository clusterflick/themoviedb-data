Now the former home of Soviet workers is almost empty – but not completely abandoned.  Every year thousands of tourists come to see the town of Pyramiden. Nine people live in Pyramiden to serve the tourists as guides, cooks and hotel employees. The residents live without Internet or telephone connections. It’s a place where one can hide from the flood of stimulus and constant messaging that surround us in the modern world – a sanctuary to find peace of mind.","popularity":0.0264,"poster_path":"/witzL5gcelcZ24QdlvlcY6MpFJ7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SJ","name":"Svalbard & Jan Mayen Islands"}],"release_date":"2019-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's Not Silence","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5118475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Romanovskiy","original_name":"Alexander Romanovskiy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"675d4f86f1bf96dc24780714","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5118477,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yevgeniya Tanaseychuk","original_name":"Yevgeniya Tanaseychuk","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"675d4fe62487d142d3045332","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5118480,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zheka Taganay","original_name":"Zheka Taganay","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"675d50122487d142d3045343","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5118482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vladimir Prokofyev","original_name":"Vladimir Prokofyev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"675d5050b038b65eddd89910","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2224746,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joonas Salo","original_name":"Joonas Salo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c48b8360e0a26494dccc53f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5100888,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tommi J.
