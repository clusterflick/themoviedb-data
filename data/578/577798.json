Its subject is the story of the advancing  Mongol army's entry to Great Kitezh and the city's subsequent miraculous survival. Rejecting archaisms and the more religiously inclined suggestions of  his librettist, Rimsky-Korsakov sought to create an opera that 'is contemporary and even fairly advanced'. It is therefore through-composed, hinting at times at  Wagnerian procedure, and flooded with the composer's rich, apt and brilliant orchestral palette, fully supportive of the powerful vocal writing.","popularity":0.0389,"poster_path":"/g3UBN47aEVaF9dMeWGfpqNPHKWI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":187,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rimsky-Korsakov: The Legend of the Invisible City Of Kitezh","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Gubsky","original_name":"Mikhail Gubsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Grishka Kuterma","credit_id":"5c4ae5849251410e2457c0dc","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tatiana Monogarova","original_name":"Tatiana Monogarova","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Fevronya","credit_id":"5c4ae58fc3a36847898c44de","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225968,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mikhail Kazakov","original_name":"Mikhail Kazakov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Prince Yuri Vsevolodovich","credit_id":"5c4ae59992514105c1540776","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gevorg Hakobyan","original_name":"Gevorg Hakobyan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Fyodor Poyarok","credit_id":"5c4ae5a20e0a267069c7fb57","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vitaly Panfilov","original_name":"Vitaly Panfilov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Hereditary prince Vsevolod Yuryevich","credit_id":"61fa383c6dc50700909e1ae2","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408931,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marika Gulordava","original_name":"Marika Gulordava","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Page","credit_id":"61fa38950c4c16006bc8946f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1682868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valery Gilmanov","original_name":"Valery Gilmanov","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Bedyay","credit_id":"61fa38ac559d22006a07fc81","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2404990,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Naumenko","original_name":"Alexander Naumenko","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Burunday","credit_id":"61fa38c2fe6c1800688c3210","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3408935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marek Kalbus","original_name":"Marek Kalbus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"61fa38ceb6abc4001ccc1db2","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1575099,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gianluca Floris","original_name":"Gianluca Floris","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"61fa38dd9e4012001c231102","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2484690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eimuntas Nekrošius","original_name":"Eimuntas Nekrošius","popularity":0.0578,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65ec8ec105a53301624c572c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/g3UBN47aEVaF9dMeWGfpqNPHKWI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-05-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
