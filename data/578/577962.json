A contemporary story about 10-year-old Sebastian and Eugene, a retired elevator man. Despite the age difference between them, they are struggling with a similar life situation - they are lonely, with no support in the family, forced to fight for survival, in a world that does not care about them. The fate of the characters is linked by a desire to get a 500-franc note, lost by a French pianist. The money fell into a deep sewage grid, from which it is not easy to take it out. They start a war with each other, use deceit, sometimes join forces to try to get the banknote on their own. With time, they become more and more exposed to each other.","popularity":0.2559,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":97330,"logo_path":"/aH2LCskwPnAXuePB3ecNmoQ7aA2.png","name":"Telewizyjna Agencja Produkcji Teatralnej i Filmowej","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":38,"logo_path":"/oZyTaSTMP9LMB6BTzPDv3q4oyMj.png","name":"Studio Filmowe Tor","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1996-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gutter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107879,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lech Dyblik","original_name":"Lech Dyblik","popularity":0.1421,"profile_path":"/1tOJ0Q0Qg3Va7shQsPAiOOylEqv.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4bedad9251415e34585fd0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sławomir Orzechowski","original_name":"Sławomir Orzechowski","popularity":0.086,"profile_path":"/qNzzr8IEbvbGJcW3p7HvgWcclve.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4bedbfc3a368477a8f66f2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1137930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerzy Kamas","original_name":"Jerzy Kamas","popularity":0.1301,"profile_path":"/3CCMxWCNGdwaRk1zwJRdF3Mc2gu.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Eugeniusz","credit_id":"5c4beddb0e0a26495ad2d776","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2226411,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zygmunt Hobot","original_name":"Zygmunt Hobot","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":"/iplppUowcRb9gCNZLpCF5MvxHvU.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4beded0e0a264965d2ac9f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1487197,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tomasz Grochoczyński","original_name":"Tomasz Grochoczyński","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/meZUsWuAxZiqTijXF0bQBJ4Kgsy.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4bedfe0e0a2612ccc72a9b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1140843,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Piotr Zelt","original_name":"Piotr Zelt","popularity":0.1164,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4bee120e0a2612ccc72baf","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1678870,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sławomir Holland","original_name":"Sławomir Holland","popularity":0.0749,"profile_path":"/5IqTe15YWMECEZVJZ0dGcLIDgQw.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4bee220e0a26495ad2d816","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2226413,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katarzyna Romańczuk","original_name":"Katarzyna Romańczuk","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":"/xVEuXjVf5pHqJV3SEQaaJCvwYIL.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4bee360e0a264962d2f509","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1198541,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Maj","original_name":"Maria Maj","popularity":0.1987,"profile_path":"/c9bNQSYlBo0KaE3mKp8MWmRppaV.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"5c4bee4f0e0a26494dd1ee18","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2226414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michał Michalak","original_name":"Michał Michalak","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Sebastian","credit_id":"5c4bee740e0a26495ad2d85d","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4472402,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Krzysztof Gajewski","original_name":"Krzysztof Gajewski","popularity":0.0846,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659d791624b333025a50b9ec","department":"Art","job":"Props"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1026297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paweł Łoziński","original_name":"Paweł Łoziński","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4bed6b92514105c155eb93","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1026297,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paweł Łoziński","original_name":"Paweł Łoziński","popularity":0.0459,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4bed750e0a260419cfb126","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2226410,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Piotr Czekanowski","original_name":"Piotr Czekanowski","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4bed90c3a368478c8f3458","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0116799","wikidata_id":"Q11748038","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7kkyBW5HkBDjAXX0dkWOWMEuSQf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"1996-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
