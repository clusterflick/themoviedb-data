Using home movies, snapshots and found footage, he creates a portrait of a exceedingly clever, yet evanescent father figure haunted by the war that sent his own father to a concentration camp. Ultimately the family moved to Canada. This political history, intertwining dreams and personal experience, seems loose and associative, but first impressions can be deceiving.","popularity":0.0583,"poster_path":"/c4pgNvFktlJsAuPmnQrDKopoTQt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"27 Thoughts About My Father","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"27 Thoughts About My Dad","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Hoolboom","original_name":"Mike Hoolboom","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/kFXKkmtIUsD5efHwk7h43qaSPSv.jpg","credit_id":"5c4a1c0e0e0a263ccdcf12ab","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Hoolboom","original_name":"Mike Hoolboom","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/kFXKkmtIUsD5efHwk7h43qaSPSv.jpg","credit_id":"5c4a1c05c3a36847828bb4e7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Hoolboom","original_name":"Mike Hoolboom","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/kFXKkmtIUsD5efHwk7h43qaSPSv.jpg","credit_id":"5c4a1c170e0a264962cfad15","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Hoolboom","original_name":"Mike Hoolboom","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/kFXKkmtIUsD5efHwk7h43qaSPSv.jpg","credit_id":"5c4a1c2492514105c152f8ef","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1127424,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Hoolboom","original_name":"Mike Hoolboom","popularity":0.1948,"profile_path":"/kFXKkmtIUsD5efHwk7h43qaSPSv.jpg","credit_id":"5c4a1bfb92514151a9511c5a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12987960","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1152,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ldGbdJOuilFjRxNA94GdsqCUs1w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2048}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1022,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c4pgNvFktlJsAuPmnQrDKopoTQt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":682}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2019-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
