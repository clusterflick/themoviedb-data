For music of such complexity and intensity, the brevity of this opera is just right; you could take it as five hours of Verdi or Wagner concentrated and crystalized in one hour of Schoenberg.","popularity":0.0542,"poster_path":"/4GU3HVZafwf6HfrxwUIf0iXigVo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schoenberg: Heute Morgen","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelangelo D'Adamo","original_name":"Michelangelo D'Adamo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c495e0e0e0a267069c59ad8","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225114,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brigitte Geller","original_name":"Brigitte Geller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c495e150e0a264965ce6c47","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eliahu Inbal","original_name":"Eliahu Inbal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c495e1bc3a36847828a84ec","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1654490,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georg Nigl","original_name":"Georg Nigl","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c495e23c3a368663486be88","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225116,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sonia Visentin","original_name":"Sonia Visentin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5c495e340e0a263ccdcdeaa4","order":4}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1067,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4GU3HVZafwf6HfrxwUIf0iXigVo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":711}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
