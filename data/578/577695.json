The close friendship between the Albrecht and Ponto families had facilitated access for Susanne. Julia was 13 years old, when this one single act committed by the Red Army Fraction terrorists shook the West German Republic to the core, as it was also considered an attack on trust, morale and common decency. Until today the Albrecht family is trying to come to terms with what happened.","popularity":0.0462,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":16844,"logo_path":"/wy2JQsrqBGhDBg8d57SGIrZtMAh.png","name":"Zero One Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Folgen der Tat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Albrecht","original_name":"Julia Albrecht","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c4a355c9251410e1b568eff","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225664,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christa Albrecht","original_name":"Christa Albrecht","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5c4a357dc3a36847938b7ccf","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1170335,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Julia Albrecht","original_name":"Julia Albrecht","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4a35d30e0a263ccdcf4996","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt8027038","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
