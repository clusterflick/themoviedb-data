This 10-minute anti-war film lost to posterity was a very loose adaptation of Franz Kafka's short story In the Penal Colony. Vesely presents the execution of a prisoner of war as a serial event that happens over and over again, ad nauseum. As of this project, Tichat worked as set designer and occasional co-author for Vesely, here also appearing in front of the camera as an actor together with H.C. Artmann. Gerhard Ruhm contributed his Musique concrete to the soundtrack.","popularity":0.0503,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Und die Kinder spielen so gern Soldaten","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134462,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Herbert Vesely","original_name":"Herbert Vesely","popularity":0.0973,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4a93d4c3a36847898bc8a8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1951-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
