Boris Godunov is Mussorgsky’s masterpiece and his only complete opera. It’s a vast sprawling tapestry of Russian life, which centres on the Russian people – represented in the opera by a large and powerful chorus – rather than on the title figure. The staging was produced at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona and is based on the original version of the score.","popularity":0.2942,"poster_path":"/2ZznGm1ZjUK8bonqPQTCK1FashF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gran Teatre del
