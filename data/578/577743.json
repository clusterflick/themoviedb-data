Late afternoon: the entr'acte between dusk and darkness, when the people who conduct their business in the street -- numbers runners in gray chesterfields, out-of-work barmaids playing the dozens, adolescents cultivating their cigarette jones and lust, small-time hustlers selling ‘authentic’ gold wristwatches that are platinum bright---look for a place to roost and to drink in the day's sin.

A greasy dive with a R & B jukebox, it could be in Detroit or in New York, could be anywhere. Opal's has a proprietor -- Opal, a young and wise black woman, who looks like the comedian Lily Tomlin -- and a little bell over the door that goes tink-a-link, announcing all the handouts and gimmes who come to sit at Opal's counter and talk about how needy their respective asses are.” — Hilton Als","popularity":0.6697,"poster_path":"/zGI1z8FuFPzkzxkvh3J5PbaHa4X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Juke and Opal","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Tomlin","original_name":"Lily Tomlin","popularity":0.9626,"profile_path":"/eoFMSqRykiaXMGCiz7Kxehfqy1W.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Opal","credit_id":"5c4a80429251415448519fea","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9309,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Pryor","original_name":"Richard Pryor","popularity":1.1679,"profile_path":"/5hLh0btIkqYPbDmJ0i4WZo9OAt2.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Juke","credit_id":"5c4a80799251415448519ffd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Alda","original_name":"Alan Alda","popularity":1.0068,"profile_path":"/6ccCKFhXiMmjLoiFDyJaU4eJaQO.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Jimmy","credit_id":"619eebedbc2cb3004285bd05","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":72402,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jane Wagner","original_name":"Jane Wagner","popularity":0.1371,"profile_path":"/jJcj7GiZDVhWX6EThGjDBVt7lKW.jpg","credit_id":"5c4a827d0e0a26494fd03172","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1219908,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Davis","original_name":"Bill Davis","popularity":0.1136,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"602c8fc9a14bef004062080d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zGI1z8FuFPzkzxkvh3J5PbaHa4X.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.658,"height":1520,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oqD3TknJS30pIpVjl305IVUa3ei.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1973-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
