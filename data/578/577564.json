Talk, laughter, and a few intravenous shots to escape and fly towards another place. But one amongst them seems to have not returned from his trip. The jury speaks: His heart is no longer beating, the dose seems to have been fatal. What are they to do now? How should they get rid of the body? A solution is found, make him fly, but the landing turns out to be not so soft for those left behind.","popularity":0.1229,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1999-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Flight","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5125,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fatih Akin","original_name":"Fatih Akin","popularity":0.7824,"profile_path":"/jqxUPrXlsAoNPY2GiZaZXUjFbTH.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5c49af39c3a368477a8b5614","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225244,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Walter Hanek","original_name":"Walter Hanek","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5c49af439251415448505f2a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1523839,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sabine Radebold","original_name":"Sabine Radebold","popularity":0.0597,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"5c49af599251410e2455fa12","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5498,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Bousdoukos","original_name":"Adam Bousdoukos","popularity":0.2719,"profile_path":"/cm0MLSjrflMKc9XPSxXcmVhaaP7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5c49af680e0a264965cedb19","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225246,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Silvana Lombardi","original_name":"Silvana Lombardi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c49af7c9251410e2255b1a5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225246,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Silvana Lombardi","original_name":"Silvana Lombardi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c49af890e0a26494fced5dc","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225247,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gerd Lombardi","original_name":"Gerd Lombardi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c49af970e0a264962cef25a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2225248,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jo Hellmuth","original_name":"Jo Hellmuth","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c49afab9251415e3454d0fa","department":"Crew","job":"Compositor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0323048","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1999-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
