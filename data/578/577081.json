They are prepared to defy the ban imposed by Sudan's Islamic Military government and they will not take no for an answer. Their battle to get officially recognized as Sudan's National Woman's team is fearless, courageous and often laughable. But their struggle is unwavering. Through the intimate portrait of these women over a number of years we follow their moments of hope and deception. Despite the National Football Federation getting FIFA funds earmarked for the women's teams, this team continues to be marginalized. However, there is a new spark of hope when the elections within the federation could mean real change of the entire system.","popularity":0.2909,"poster_path":"/9MmL9H2y0XEK7jCxWozCXCNsvpi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113822,"logo_path":null,"name":"One Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":113823,"logo_path":"/eFeTaByqfVS0uDdvrnKlctyUXNs.png","name":"Stray Dogs","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"SD","name":"Sudan"}],"release_date":"2019-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Khartoum Offside","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2461991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elham Balatone","original_name":"Elham Balatone","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Elham","credit_id":"5dd3fd3457d3780b1fd71e9a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2461993,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nedal Fadlallah","original_name":"Nedal Fadlallah","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Henda","credit_id":"5dd3fd4257d3780b1fd71eaa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2461994,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fatma Gaddal","original_name":"Fatma Gaddal","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Gaddal","credit_id":"5dd3fd5028723c00124dba68","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2461995,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sara Jubara","original_name":"Sara Jubara","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Captain Sara","credit_id":"5dd3fd5d356a715875ea6688","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2223895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marwa Zein","original_name":"Marwa Zein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c473b989251415e34509db5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1899173,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Henrik Underbjerg","original_name":"Henrik Underbjerg","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c473baf9251410e14512dfb","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2223895,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marwa Zein","original_name":"Marwa Zein","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c473bbd0e0a260419c6dcc0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1394606,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Johan Eklund","original_name":"Johan Eklund","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c473bd8c3a368576a857923","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132004,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sara Kaddouri","original_name":"Sara Kaddouri","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c473bcd92514105c14e2171","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2223896,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mohamed Emad","original_name":"Mohamed Emad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c473bc4c3a368663482c943","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9221304","wikidata_id":"Q72164557","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9MmL9H2y0XEK7jCxWozCXCNsvpi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":187,"name":"islam"},{"id":5951,"name":"sudan"},{"id":13042,"name":"football (soccer)"},{"id":254525,"name":"khartoum, sudan"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Berlinale (Forum)","release_date":"2019-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ar","note":"Afrikanisches Filmfestival Hamburg 2019","release_date":"2019-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
