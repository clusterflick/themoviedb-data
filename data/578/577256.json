Northern Ireland's greatest film director Brian Desmond Hurst directed the film and his assistant director was fellow Ulsterman William (Bill) MacQuitty who went on to make the ultimate Titanic film A Night to Remember. The script was written by Terence Young who went on to direct the early Bond films. All the components were in place for a fine film and this short (32 minute) by the Crown Film Unit remains an important part of Ulster and America's cultural history. As the opening credit says \"This film is dedicated to those members of the US Forces Who are our guests in these islands\". The film shows American soldiers landing in Northern Ireland and settling into their new camps. The arrival of mail from 'back home' helps camp moral, however, two brothers receive none. Their commander realises that the two brothers have not sent any letters back to their parents and gives the order to write a letter home- A Letter From Ulster.","popularity":0.1083,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16204,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crown Film Unit","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":6309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministry of Information","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1943-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Letter from Ulster","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terence Young","original_name":"Terence Young","popularity":0.4435,"profile_path":"/5Kq0XBQ4VxD7WHztKthdIF1XxVP.jpg","credit_id":"5c4846ae9251415e345294d5","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":261224,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brian Desmond Hurst","original_name":"Brian Desmond Hurst","popularity":0.0731,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c4846bf0e0a264965cc4ff2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1764154","wikidata_id":"Q4657696","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1943-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
