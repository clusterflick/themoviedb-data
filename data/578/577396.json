In Miami-Dade County, an average of 30 children and teenagers are killed by gun violence annually. So far in 2016, 13 have fallen victim.  The film brings awareness to the dark and light of Overtown. The light and happy feeling of Spring’s transition to Summer, juxtaposes the pain caused by gun violence. Price and O’Neal both direct and edit while O’Neal lends his art, poetry, and activities to showcase a tender view of his home.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ihtCYKBE3L6Gzk1IWrU5sRJhER0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer Before Springs End","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2224858,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Terence Price II","original_name":"Terence Price II","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c48e43e92514105c15130a4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ihtCYKBE3L6Gzk1IWrU5sRJhER0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
