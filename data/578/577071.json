But beside standing in front of the legendary techno club Berghain in Berlin, he is also a well-known and skilled photographer. Long before the Berlin Wall came down, Marquardt portrayed the subcultural East-Berlin scene. His black and white photography illustrates it as voluptuous, laid-back, dirty and existential.

night.","popularity":0.1894,"poster_path":"/hKiY5syUell0cuN1NWn7chPWjjT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2067,"logo_path":"/y5knLIUjYsKBIlM4W0dLruWwYaC.png","name":"RBB","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2628,"logo_path":"/2bjY4cHhM4uOUyJScYepNQvp7Pc.png","name":"It
