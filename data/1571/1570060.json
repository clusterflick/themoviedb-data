Their encounter moves the raven's heart, awakening creativity where there was once only silence. Through the metaphor of an unexpected muse, the story explores the tension between silence and song, chaos and creation. The raven, once isolated, finds new meaning in life through melody, sparked by the presence of the nightingale. Ravenera is a poetic tale about inspiration, the unexpected arrival of creativity, and the deeply personal, often ironic journey of artistic awakening.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ravenera","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5778117,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Teodor Mladenov Ralev","original_name":"Teodor Mladenov Ralev","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6900005a476972682b276636","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
