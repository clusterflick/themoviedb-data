It later became eclipsed by the even bigger success of Il matrimonio segreto however, and has become a rarity on stage today. Set in a London hotel, this cheerful ‘Intermezzo in musica’ has cleverly crafted arias, duets and ensembles that drive the plot along, the story being one of thwarted love, quarrels and misunderstandings. L’Italiana in Londra has been summed up by director R.B. Schlather as ‘incredibly charming and sophisticated ... demanding, dark, dirty and very funny ... an impeccable rom-com.’","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/jK09TzFDRI0TrvZbcYcDP0v7xRy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":233938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oper Frankfurt","origin_country":""},{"id":77605,"logo_path":null,"name":"NAXOS","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":157,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'Italiana in Londra","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"Domenico Cimarosa: L'Italiana in Londra","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5778252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Vallone","original_name":"Angela Vallone","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Livia (Soprano)","credit_id":"690013d88b9e1d01692765c1","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5778254,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bianca Tognocchi","original_name":"Bianca Tognocchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Madama Brillante (Soprano)","credit_id":"69001403e20ab361a1bbf935","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5778257,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theo Lebow","original_name":"Theo Lebow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Sumers (Tenor)","credit_id":"690014268f13340740a63694","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2383466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iurii Samoilov","original_name":"Iurii Samoilov","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Milord Arespingh (Baritone)","credit_id":"690014461abe9b900893919a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4852485,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Bintner","original_name":"Gordon Bintner","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Don Polidoro (Bass-Baritone)","credit_id":"690014627958eafc8e3c011b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5511625,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leo Hussain","original_name":"Leo Hussain","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6900148832f918ebdaa31436","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2856784,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"R.B.
