Between epic atmospheres and playful pop incursions, an audacious bard and a band of unlikely heroes face its psionic horror in a whirlwind of battles, illusions, and surreal comedy. A journey between myth and parody that turns the multiverseâ€™s most feared monster into the protagonist of a story as unsettling as it is irresistible.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"monster manual","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5777939,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Federico  Vallarino","original_name":"Federico  Vallarino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ffe83fd7160be0de2ab040","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
