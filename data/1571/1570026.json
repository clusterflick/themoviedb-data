Unless, of course, skiing is art and skiers are artists? Faction's fourth feature film exhibits pure creativity through a series of freeski sequences-from the vibrant streets of Japan, to the powdery pillows of British Columbia, to the finely-manicured terrain parks of Switzerland and Italy. Each location provides a blank canvas for the team's artistic expression. Because nothing screams \"artist\" like sending large cliffs and grinding the side of buildings. In co-production with Red Bull Media House.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/vBZuhcBfG9WsG5hMWHC6An51plb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abstract: A Freeski Exhibition","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1935756,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Etienne Mérel","original_name":"Etienne Mérel","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68fff093e3cbdd633fbbf981","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38779884","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1000,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vBZuhcBfG9WsG5hMWHC6An51plb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":667}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
