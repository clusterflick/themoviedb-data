Just before it's renovation, I had the chance to visit it again and scanned every room, every corner, every crack, through photogrammetry. The point clouds captured, reconstruct it's digital twin in 3d space, a navigatable virtual copy. In \"Mnemonic nebulae\", clouds of points organize a \"digital nebula\", where gravity pulls particles into densities that compose fleeting images of the interior of the house, through which the eye travels from room to room. Perhaps, this will be a way in the future to recall and hold our memories of the past.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"mnemonic nebulae","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5778143,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vasiliki Betsou","original_name":"Vasiliki Betsou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690004d858f46bb30e9fba30","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
