The film traces the journey of a pair of Tabi from concept to final assembly. In an artisanal process, every stage is carried out by hand. Preparing the base takes up to four hours, followed by the mould: cut from a block of wood, then stitching, and assembly. The practice gathers 11 artisans, each with their specific expertise, and each shoe is finished with a single white stitch.  A Tabi film documents technique and craft, capturing the shoe that endures over time. Footage from the archive depicts the heritage associated with the form that sets it apart.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":105609,"logo_path":null,"name":"IlCapo Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2025-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Tabi Film","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1946844,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ermanna Montanari","original_name":"Ermanna Montanari","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":"/6s9ELz67URqLaIe8Ba4z1fXtkWN.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"69016568f253f61b58014001","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262443,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yuri Ancarani","original_name":"Yuri Ancarani","popularity":0.0603,"profile_path":"/rEtvMeXJJJ5tJLHmVVC0AUZr7WO.jpg","credit_id":"6901654e87298dfa6c42c1b0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5780852,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Giorgio Blosi","original_name":"Giorgio Blosi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6901659f8314981ce901401c","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2558866,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mirko Fabbri","original_name":"Mirko Fabbri","popularity":0.0466,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690165b5c7b1f88642a8b4dc","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4497976,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Thomas Pilani","original_name":"Thomas Pilani","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690165e25e5a987bbeb64b98","department":"Crew","job":"Post Production Supervisor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2679312,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Alessandro Pelliccia","original_name":"Alessandro Pelliccia","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690166013f9a848e7e42c193","department":"Editing","job":"Color Grading"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3288224,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Davide Curto","original_name":"Davide Curto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6901661030fcf10e87c45fe7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5780855,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elisabetta Calligaro","original_name":"Elisabetta Calligaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6901664eca5865c9c9014001","department":"Production","job":"Production Assistant"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5780856,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Giacomo Strada","original_name":"Giacomo Strada","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6901665dbb149e128b014005","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5780857,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Michela Natella","original_name":"Michela Natella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6901666c0e0d6f9b4d013ffa","department":"Art","job":"Set Designer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":15479,"name":"fashion"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2025-10-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
