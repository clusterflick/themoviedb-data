Bathed in the warm light of long June days and with the intimidating spectre of an unknown future looming (both his and the world’s), the tale is a highly precise character study told from the perspective of the recently departed. Through the prism of loss, the earnest, nuanced and intimate account of a young person’s very immediate but suppressed emotions becomes a generational snapshot. Utilizing a naturalistic approach, paired with a highly cinematic and formalistically elevated lens, the film highlights the raw, vivid and often overwhelming sentiments of youth with sensitivity and grace.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13839,"logo_path":"/125UdB9wgDkY2RNpjgCiKyk3Dll.png","name":"Metafilms","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":134166,"logo_path":"/tINT6vMiVhG0LuLbDYxXZlGMm6L.png","name":"Primo Content","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":173777,"logo_path":"/mCL0SOgB4osJy3WZ143X2u3QkGf.png","name":"SOLAB FILMS","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Lay Me by the Shore","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5536673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harris Lowe","original_name":"Harris Lowe","popularity":0.0696,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6902235efc5518deb6c46231","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4658366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Violet Dolejsi","original_name":"Violet Dolejsi","popularity":0.0552,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6902236887298dfa6c42c3aa","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16702,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sean Harris","original_name":"Sean Harris","popularity":2.7904,"profile_path":"/jouyaTu0UuZMNBrADRRkCQX1VX1.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"690223735c27ffa9c2f8927c","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2108762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Findlay","original_name":"David Findlay","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69022384c7b1f88642a8b7c9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2108762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Findlay","original_name":"David Findlay","popularity":0.0913,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6902238f50a766f8a8a8b839","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2477202,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Farhad Ghaderi","original_name":"Farhad Ghaderi","popularity":0.0655,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690223a36eae82a8bec4622e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1015839,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sylvain Corbeil","original_name":"Sylvain Corbeil","popularity":0.1455,"profile_path":"/qPcqRomdQSb1FiDOvqUkymn9WHP.jpg","credit_id":"690223b9e70a5eb7bba8b82b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1612625,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathan Drillot","original_name":"Nathan Drillot","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690223c8f253f61b5801421a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1046546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Powell","original_name":"Nicole Powell","popularity":0.3213,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690223ddfc34b45a7f1db292","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":"Q136669135","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
