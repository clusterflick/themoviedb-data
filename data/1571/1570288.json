The film traces the roots of this bloody struggle to reveal how main kayu—literally “playing with wood,” meaning both stealing timber and wielding violence—defines both sides of the fight. It questions who gets to decide what “the state” means, and who truly owns the land, the forest, and the people within them. Echoing Samin Surosentiko’s words—“The earth, the water, the wood belong to all”—the unfinished 54-minute film (circa 2006–2007) endures as a haunting reflection on power and ownership.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Main Kayu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
