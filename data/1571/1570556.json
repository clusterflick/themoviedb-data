Armed with night vision cameras and a spirit box, he begins what seems like another routine ghost hunt, until the equipment captures something impossible. When his friend Ben arrives covered in blood and the spirit box begins looping a cryptic phrase, Cooper realizes he's not documenting the paranormal, he's being hunted by something. As the entity closes in through the darkness, Cooper discovers the horrifying truth: Adam Malone's face was never found because something else took it first. And now it's collecting again.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/pjFinBLUYLrdRPu3IcZ7PJZGTYl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":278707,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Cooper","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The camera sees everything.
