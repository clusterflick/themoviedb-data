Featuring survivors freed under the DVSJA law, survivors denied resentencing, campaign leaders, legislators, judges, and activists who spent 10 years advocating for and enacting the law in NY State, the film offers a powerful and consequential lens on the connection that must be made between domestic violence and criminal violence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond Survival","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1302558,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gregg Conde","original_name":"Gregg Conde","popularity":0.084,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690191b3ed1937b2d539a115","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1973194,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chanelle Elaine","original_name":"Chanelle Elaine","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690191e5730c54fedeb64c03","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5781022,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Colin Elliott","original_name":"Colin Elliott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6901921ef914def1ad200758","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2412466,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Colin Elliott","original_name":"Colin Elliott","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6901922c8a18ec655b200751","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5781023,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tamar Kraft-Stolar","original_name":"Tamar Kraft-Stolar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69019254294e56f06a42c21c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1409883,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kristie Lutz","original_name":"Kristie Lutz","popularity":0.1217,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6901926e5e898b4a9eb64bf4","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5781024,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mohamed Madboly","original_name":"Mohamed Madboly","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690192b0ab38860b9b93594c","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1168690,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Veronica Nickel","original_name":"Veronica Nickel","popularity":0.1311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690192be232ddd0aa41db02e","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4016598,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bianca Vargas","original_name":"Bianca Vargas","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690192cf30fcf10e87c4608b","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5781028,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jaya Vasandani","original_name":"Jaya Vasandani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690192ebc7b1f88642a8b5c1","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4948490,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bo Garcia","original_name":"Bo Garcia","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69019306ed1937b2d539a11b","department":"Camera","job":"Additional Camera"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5781030,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Naomi Saito","original_name":"Naomi Saito","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6901931ccd4f667ff742c1f5","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt38265342","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-09-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
