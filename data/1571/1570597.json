For many years, his grandfather has been searching for the remains of soldiers who died during the Great Patriotic War near Rzhev—an activity that Sasha finds pointless and remote from his life. But a random accident changes everything, transporting him to a space where the past comes alive and ceases to be a textbook page. Caught in a strange time warp, Sasha encounters soldiers from the Great Patriotic War and realizes that his own future is now tied to their unfinished story. To escape the time loop, he must undergo a series of rigorous trials that will force him to understand the concepts of memory, duty, the price of courage, and love.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Возвращение Мендыша","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2221929,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Igor Denisov","original_name":"Игорь Денисов","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":"/hPTWoec1o2jRs5QlfFRsIhVtlbq.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6901224975a35b70569395ed","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143752,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergey Kholmogorov","original_name":"Сергей Холмогоров","popularity":0.2925,"profile_path":"/zqM3MK9cMoDBrAnFvQe6aE0N0lh.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"690122542aecd0bc7d3c0392","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1630177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alesia Pukhovaja","original_name":"Алеся Пуховая","popularity":0.203,"profile_path":"/sqE6naYntjlTE8WDZOJILP2Iz2q.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6901225fbb34fa4ec5c3e2d9","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1400213,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pavel Ignatov","original_name":"Павел Игнатов","popularity":0.085,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6901222aebbb584ca32abb28","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":116014,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexandr Shevtsov","original_name":"Александр Шевцов","popularity":0.2189,"profile_path":"/zp83b2QaWPVq1xVzT2pdP2cNBJp.jpg","credit_id":"69012277075355b421c3e25f","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
