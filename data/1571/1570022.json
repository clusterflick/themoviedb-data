Born from the collaboration with Stefano Tiranti, composer and producer, the video weaves animation and music into a sensory experience suspended between reality and nightmare, where the protagonist faces a mysterious shadow that fractures his everyday life. In a crescendo of tension, driven by pulsing basslines, dramatic violins, and distorted guitar, Mk 1 drags the audience into a voyage toward the unknown, leaving open questions that await answers in the next short film.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"mk1","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
