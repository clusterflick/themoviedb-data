Inspired by medieval paintings of celestial portents, The Gloaming is a work of bio-mysticism that takes the form of a fable. The slippage between substances and the ethereal nature of matter finds a parallel in the chemical accretions of the hand-processed film. The film offers a story of adaptation and survival in a time of environmental uncertainty.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gloaming","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
