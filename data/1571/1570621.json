Structured to follow the gradual progression of ages on screen, the film takes us into the bubble of various children from ages 1 to 5, at a stage where the world seems to revolve around them, and self-awareness slowly shifts from 'I' to 'We’. Through these rarely filmed moments, human nature gradually takes shape. Kindergarten is the fourth film of a series about life's milestones.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kindergarten","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1307960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-François Caissy","original_name":"Jean-François Caissy","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69012997468ba8791e276969","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5780336,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jean-François Caissy","original_name":"Jean-François Caissy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690129ab9c0d32362b3c028c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1307960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-François Caissy","original_name":"Jean-François Caissy","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690129baf04d333db3da082c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":967179,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nicolas Canniccioni","original_name":"Nicolas Canniccioni","popularity":0.1291,"profile_path":"/o20tAMvCEftbvoh8HrIPYZr0Oes.jpg","credit_id":"690129d2276cc8ddf2c3e28d","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5780338,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mathieu Bouchard-Malo","original_name":"Mathieu Bouchard-Malo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"690129e1f1e8924a339fbc1b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2011662,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Simon Gervais","original_name":"Simon Gervais","popularity":0.0718,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69012a00b2d99de05b9fbbb2","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5780339,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Guillaume Bourque","original_name":"Guillaume Bourque","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69012a0eb1ff17b4cf4e943f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2272848,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jérémi Roy","original_name":"Jérémi Roy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69012a6367921210f0a3181f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1307960,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-François Caissy","original_name":"Jean-François Caissy","popularity":0.0637,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69012a7d1d088d944dfb78f3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1685922,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Lynne Trépanier","original_name":"Lynne Trépanier","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69012a979c0d32362b3c029f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":46440,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Jean-Paul Vialard","original_name":"Jean-Paul Vialard","popularity":0.1279,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69012ab1cb68b77ea3bbfda1","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2vmQ4kiRPNqsnWt11qrNeGossWd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
