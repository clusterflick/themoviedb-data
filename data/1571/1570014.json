Between the ebb and flow of tides, the city’s exposed shoreline is home to a fish that walks on land, the mud crab that clings tenaciously to mangrove tree trunks, the mighty periwinkle, the bubbler crab that spits out sand balls and many other fascinating creatures. In and around mangrove forest creeks, amidst steaming vessels and a new skyline, the film takes you on a silent journey through a delicate wetland ecosystem on the shores of an industrial city that might soon disappear.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/xE69SosKS82tH5f0NpurXKXSLJp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Urdu","iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Karachi, Shore, Marine Life","title":"Sometimes Even the Shore Drowns","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1998474,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mahera Omar","original_name":"Mahera Omar","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"68ffee2905b75544d2a313ac","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":800,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xE69SosKS82tH5f0NpurXKXSLJp.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":33477,"name":"shore"},{"id":240494,"name":"marine life"},{"id":257155,"name":"karachi"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ur","note":"Saahil Ki Kahaaniyan - Stories from the Coast","release_date":"2022-08-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
