In times before recorded history, King Pest conquered territories for his empire with the help of a mystical warrior. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, this warrior destroyed everything in his path—men, women, children, even entire villages were wiped out. The warrior was known as Blaas Karma - the black spirit, because in addition to his incredible powers, he could run on water, defy magic, and resist all known poisons.  However, the king betrayed Blaas Karma in his greed and decided to kill the warrior. Everything went wrong, though, and the warrior escaped – only to find out how his former father had plundered the land.  It is time for revenge, but the King still has a trump card up his sleeve — his connections to the Black Lord, the true ruler of the world, must be put to use once again in order to win the battle. But the Black Lord has his own plans for Karma and the world... In addition to revenge, the fate of the future is at stake!","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Kristian Salhi causes more bloodshed and destruction than Conan and Lone Wolf combined!","title":"Black Karma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2390508","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
