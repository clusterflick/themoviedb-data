Highland Bowl isn’t just any ski run. At 12,392 feet, it’s one of the toughest—and most beloved—spots in North America. For Niklaus, the climb isn’t just about the challenge. It’s where he feels closest to something bigger than himself.  This film is about more than just ticking off laps. It’s about grit, passion, and the kind of quiet determination that pulls people together. As Niklaus pushes toward his goal, he becomes a reminder that it’s never too late to chase what lights you up—and that sometimes, the wildest dreams bring out the best in all of us.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"80 for 80","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
