Steele is bitterly disappointed and before Isobel can explain her little joke, he leaves and joins the Northwest Mounted Police, in which he soon distinguishes himself. He is assigned to bring in Bucky Nome, a notorious gambler and lecher who is wanted for murder. Colonel Becker, Isobel's wealthy father, is interested in the fur business and goes to Canada, taking her with him. Bucky wrecks the pleasure train on which they are riding and kidnaps Isobel. Steele eventually catches up with Bucky, bringing him to justice and rescuing Isobel. The subdued girl explains her joke, and Steele resigns from the force, again taking his place in polite society.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/huJDUHLMvYUlpliLHKsgGnDoYeS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Blood Stirring Drama of a Great Criminal Hunt","title":"Steele of the Royal Mounted","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","title":"Sofrer, Amar e Vencer","type":"Brazilian title"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"漂浪の健児","type":"Japanese title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":183281,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bert Lytell","original_name":"Bert Lytell","popularity":0.6622,"profile_path":"/74yamUYVat9e0j60gRmj1aCymGp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Philip Steele","credit_id":"6900b8ee15618f0398da0668","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":119542,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stuart Holmes","original_name":"Stuart Holmes","popularity":1.4937,"profile_path":"/s22P75fI3Mt5D8TbNTIEnSuSQIX.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Bucky Nome","credit_id":"6900b921dc8597cee4a63779","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1112942,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Merriam","original_name":"Charlotte Merriam","popularity":0.5347,"profile_path":"/51gcGksRrnNUYdnnMBNnYcUGfWU.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Isobel Becker","credit_id":"6900b95f0b145efb452ab580","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1205558,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mabel Julienne Scott","original_name":"Mabel Julienne Scott","popularity":1.8836,"profile_path":"/4HBNuzfVOJt2Lu8hgPvdslAQhXd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Mrs. Thorpe","credit_id":"6900b98ae31a6839613c02b5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidney De Gray","original_name":"Sidney De Gray","popularity":0.4625,"profile_path":"/SOgFn4B9q5LBIxamOlPWoiKKua.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Colonel Becker","credit_id":"6900b9a8dcaa455cf09fb8f9","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5779289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Toughey","original_name":"John Toughey","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Colonel MacGregor","credit_id":"6900b9c9b2d99de05b9fb99a","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5779278,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Smith","original_name":"David Smith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6900b8345f7acb181fa31357","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24426,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Oliver Curwood","original_name":"James Oliver Curwood","popularity":0.5943,"profile_path":"/8hhzku4GGUdcsOVrydWrtcFr6NW.jpg","credit_id":"6900b9edb1ff17b4cf4e9211","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1431721,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jay Pilcher","original_name":"Jay Pilcher","popularity":0.1013,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6900b9fff57d1caf913c020d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4335728,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"W.
