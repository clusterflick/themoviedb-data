She is interviewed about her notorious pornography that exploits settler desire of “Imaginary Indians”. The film is a comedy that playfully engages the subjects of Indigenous identity, the politics of recognition, the “playing Indian” phenomenon, and Canada’s hottest piece of tail - The Beaver. We are invited to ponder how deeply historical and contemporary settler-indigenous relations impact our sexuality.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The First Indigenous Female Pornographer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5779923,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"JL Whitecrow","original_name":"JL Whitecrow","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6901062d9e50829caea639b6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
