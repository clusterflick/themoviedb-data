Babs' father, the powerful Senator Marvin, is supporting Eben Sprague for a seat in the State Legislature. Darrow discovers that Sprague is a crook and threatens to expose the candidate unless the senator agrees to switch his support to him. Babs opposes Darrow's decision, fearing that it will ruin his promising law career. Determined to defeat Darrow, she promotes the candidacy of the village pauper, Hank Dawes, and contrives an elaborate campaign based upon the slogan that Dawes' election would remove him from the welfare rolls. Dawes wins the election, but Darrow is consoled with Babs's love and the senator's support of his law career.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/ffwrf3TNAJYJQB5ISRxKjx9X1g6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20936,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corinne Griffith Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1920-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A story of a girl who takes a hand in politics when the men folks fail to manage to her liking.","title":"Babs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Bab's Candidate","type":"Alternative title"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Gumshoes 4-B","type":"Working title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1054643,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Corinne Griffith","original_name":"Corinne Griffith","popularity":0.6335,"profile_path":"/aBcI7FfEVDDlxPMnxOoX8bmozL.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Barbara Marvin","credit_id":"6900eaa03ea40a98274e9272","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":262394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Fawcett","original_name":"George Fawcett","popularity":0.814,"profile_path":"/pZBmcj6XkdBkNKvUIovZMNqg8qU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Senator Merrill Treadwill Marvin","credit_id":"6900eac8a2fd3117562ab514","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1475051,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Webster Campbell","original_name":"Webster Campbell","popularity":0.2504,"profile_path":"/vbWzo3T7QE10QxvRiotaYcidjbB.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"David Darrow","credit_id":"6900eaed42da8c10922767e5","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2376686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles S.
