A Way of Life","overview":"Hinduism is a philosophy. It is therefore a big or small as persons mind. Hinduism originated on the Indian subcontinent and it is one of the most mysterious and ancient faiths in the world. Having two million Gods, people choose the God to worship which they feel will protect them and help guide them through their everyday life. In Hinduism every God from every religion is welcome. To a Hindu to worship any God cannot hurt, it may even help.  Considered to be the oldest religion in the world, Hinduism has no single founder and is based on a number of religious texts developed over many centuries that contain spiritual insights and practical guidelines for religious life.  Come, take a journey into the world s third largest religion and you may find in it something that will touch your heart. It can be something that you have been following for years even though you may not be Hindu. This is because Hinduism is not a religion per se.
