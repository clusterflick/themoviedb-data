The work utilizes a split-screen format to simultaneously present the transformation of the same clay bust into two contradictory psychological realities: The Left Screen depicts the Hunter's (The Accuser's) hardening into a cold judgment and moral decay, conceptually justified by Murat Kaplan's facial analysis; while the Right Screen reflects the Victim's (The Innocent's) dissolution into helplessness, fear, and ultimate surrender. This organic yet unnatural transformation of the busts places the viewer in the irreducible gap between two contradictory testimonies. The core goal of the work is to demonstrate the impossibility of objective truth by proving that reality is entirely dependent on the observer's subjective point of view.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":"/59TxaFXPjK1j437M6lkCB6n0v24.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"See Two Truths at Once.
