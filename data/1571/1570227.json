They are outside Amyâ€™s apartment complex, shooting\r the shit on the side of the building. Though the 80s were many years ago now, it\r has always been smoking cigarettes, passing them to your friends, who drinks\r wine, who drinks beer, and who is shooting tequila. Each girl carries her own\r charisma. This is definitely not their first Halloween together, they have known\r each other for years and we will know each other for years to come. A dynamic,\r closeness, and continuous flow of bullshit.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carrot Farmer","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
