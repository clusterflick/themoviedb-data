It is both a digital experiment and a broader visual and philosophical inquiry into the nature of form, movement, environment and communication - or its absence - between different modes of existence.  The narrative unfolds within a dual world: beneath the surface of the water lies a realm of organic forms generated algorithmically, while above it, a strictly standardized, mechanical reality prevails. A world of abandoned machines, operating incessantly without purpose, in the absence of their creator. These two worlds do not communicate; they are unaware of one another's existence.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"levi","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5778197,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Isidoros Plakotaris","original_name":"Isidoros Plakotaris","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69000983eef9a1ffc3eab75d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
