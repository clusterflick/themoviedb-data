Based on a poem by Sandra Penna, which was inspired by a children's song about a couple who has broken up, this tape overturns the sunny idealism and rhymes typically found in children's songs. Contradictory feelings, imperfect remembrances and the inaccuracy of time are suggested by the poignant collage of home movies, voiceover, and music.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/7IX17WaWwxWm3DJJdKXdvlQkWpO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tumitinhas","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2606240,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Josefina Cerqueira","original_name":"Josefina Cerqueira","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9b2236e22d2800225fa96d","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1208201,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Stephen Vitiello","original_name":"Stephen Vitiello","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/zPrt36cwI4k2BPCdaIh42SmY5rZ.jpg","credit_id":"5e9b221bfd6fa10024020677","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1406359,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eder Santos","original_name":"Eder Santos","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9b21b1fd6fa1001f020370","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7IX17WaWwxWm3DJJdKXdvlQkWpO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"Portuguese\", \"english_name\"=>\"Portuguese\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"pt\", \"native_name\"=>\"Portuguese\"}","note":"","release_date":"1998-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
