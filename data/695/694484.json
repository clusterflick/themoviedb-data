As an artist that has astounded the world for three decades, he has also suffered from hyper-realistic hallucinations and visions since he was a child - eventually diagnosed as autism and prosopagnosia. His artwork has been lauded and collected by cultural luminaries such as Jeff Bridges (actor), Paul Allen(co-founder, Microsoft), and filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather). Audiences both familiar and unfamiliar with Woodring’s work will be fascinated by this powerful, cinematic biography which details the artist’s haunted youth and his attempts to make sense of a world that seemed less real while dealing with the challenges of his autism and spiritual curiosities.","popularity":0.0739,"poster_path":"/5RrFWuYaCFc8PzPPro65FF4gqtQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":248192,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bain Street Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Illumination of Jim Woodring","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"L'illuminazione di Jim Woodring","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Woodring","original_name":"Jim Woodring","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e9ae60cfd6fa1002401c0ed","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1063830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Brandt","original_name":"Chris Brandt","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9ae685eb79c2001e5b2a76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1063830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Brandt","original_name":"Chris Brandt","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67691f72231202807d0b1148","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1317160,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jim Woodring","original_name":"Jim Woodring","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67691f9057f6a67c855ce260","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1063830,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chris Brandt","original_name":"Chris Brandt","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67691facad7eebcd755ce41f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5136852,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"MIguel Cima","original_name":"MIguel Cima","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67691fc439fec6bcacc4dbdb","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5136853,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Douglas Horn","original_name":"Douglas Horn","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67691ffd1c54ebfed5c4dbb8","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5136854,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pete Mecchi","original_name":"Pete Mecchi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6769201d57f6a67c855ce27d","department":"Editing","job":"Additional Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5136856,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dave Copp","original_name":"Dave Copp","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"676920501c54ebfed5c4dbd6","department":"Sound","job":"Recording Supervision"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11230770","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nNuA35OQnacsf0895WDqZfXBrj3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5RrFWuYaCFc8PzPPro65FF4gqtQ.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zjpEPwVCYOAHdAsUxIqZT5XqhTW.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":533},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/awXZJb8k4zBOpu0fn5O3QUVw1bI.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2019-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
