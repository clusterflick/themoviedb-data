In several cases, though, the only people who knew about the secret spots of those personal treasures died before they could go back to recover them. According to inhabitants of that region, the spirits of those tormented men would reveal the location of those \"buried and hidden\" treasures to chosen people in their dreams, visions or by haunting them. \"The Legend of the Paraguay War\" approaches local legends in a historic and literary way. Those legends were born from within the biggest conflict in South America, and were developed and influenced by the local imaginary view of the world and which can be considered a relevant part of those people's identity up to this day","popularity":0.2936,"poster_path":"/wCohlMYrzAcdjCymX0fuFxB8gxc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104839,"logo_path":null,"name":"MS
