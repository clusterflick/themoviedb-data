Conjuring is notable as Méliès's second film, and as his first to move beyond the actuality film genre pioneered by the Lumière brothers and experiment with using the camera to capture a theatrical magic act. (Later in 1896, with his discovery of the substitution splice technique, Méliès was able to begin augmenting his theatrical illusions with new special effects unique to film.) Conjuring can thus be seen as Méliès's first foray into the world of fiction film.  The film was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and numbered 2 in its catalogues.","popularity":0.1365,"poster_path":"/pfb2kGvcW7d4SaLsEEgUVr9wnEt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45867,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1896-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Before there was the stop trick, there was the magic trick","title":"Conjuring","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":0.1982,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5e99ad18b339030015a3eb8f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":11523,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Georges Méliès","original_name":"Georges Méliès","popularity":0.1982,"profile_path":"/acx5saf22Qj6FV5WAsacRHlZAMn.jpg","credit_id":"5e99ad379defda0015bd482a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0000123","wikidata_id":"Q27959608","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pfb2kGvcW7d4SaLsEEgUVr9wnEt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":264876,"name":"melies"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"French\", \"english_name\"=>\"French\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"fr\", \"native_name\"=>\"French\"}","note":"The year is correct, month is between may and july","release_date":"1896-06-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
