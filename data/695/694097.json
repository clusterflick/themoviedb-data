This animated film imposes the questions of oppressive gender patterns, through a symbolic depiction of specific prohibitions and desired behavior when it comes to women. The participants had an opportunity do conduct different types of intervention on the photographs of the actresses from the film, through drawing and coloring. That way, the young people were symbolically adding their views on how girls should look today and participating in their gender representation, just like the society does it through its agents of socialization in real life.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/uxCmgBK9fTPJ3xk7sYHoQHp2aUP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132334,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beogradski centar za ljudska prava","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alma","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2604469,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Nevena Nikolić","original_name":"Nevena Nikolić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9961bbfdf8b70013a44c4a","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2604464,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Demir Mekić","original_name":"Demir Mekić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e99617119ab59001448cd5d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2604465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nebojša Petrović","original_name":"Nebojša Petrović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e996196fdf8b7001aa43f06","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2604467,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Dino Aganović","original_name":"Dino Aganović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9961a19defda0013bce2a2","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2604464,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Demir Mekić","original_name":"Demir Mekić","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e996179058224001aafe123","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2604465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nebojša Petrović","original_name":"Nebojša Petrović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9961b019ab59001448cdf7","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2604465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nebojša Petrović","original_name":"Nebojša Petrović","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e996184fdf8b70013a44bc5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uxCmgBK9fTPJ3xk7sYHoQHp2aUP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
