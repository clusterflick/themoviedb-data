Jonas performs in a direct, one-on-one confrontation with the viewer, using the immediacy and intimacy of video as conceptual constructs. Exploring video as both a mirror and a masking device, and using her body as an art object, she undertakes an examination of self and identity, subjectivity and objectivity. Creating a series of inversions, she splits her image, splits the video screen, and splits her identification within the video space, playing with the spatial ambiguity of non-reversed images (video) and reversed images (mirrors). Though Jonas' approach is formalist and reductive, her performance reveals an ironic theatricality. Illustrating the phenomenology of video as a mirror, Left Side Right Side is a classic of early performance-based, conceptual video.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/bSl5TYYvuCn6SREd3VX2sXdFwLG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Left Side, Right Side","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1309429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Jonas","original_name":"Joan Jonas","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/8rvC6EidwNnIVQvQgjmVdVNbTrp.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5fa2bfaf691cd50036cfe6f4","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1309429,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joan Jonas","original_name":"Joan Jonas","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/8rvC6EidwNnIVQvQgjmVdVNbTrp.jpg","credit_id":"5e9946429defda0013bcba0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7Yh3jXy6sLuFUCpm4Ai8zzAzkKi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bSl5TYYvuCn6SREd3VX2sXdFwLG.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1972-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"National Gallery of Art: Lynda Benglis and Her Contemporaries","release_date":"2020-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
