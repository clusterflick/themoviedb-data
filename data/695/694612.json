Writes Schneemann: \"I think of this work as an exploded canvas, units of rapidly changing clusters. A flow of energy which makes an active audience inevitable and necessary — not to mimic the performance, but to absorb relations within the space and between one another — to be correspondent to the materials and imagery, grasping a conscious and realizable wish to replace the performers with themselves.\"","popularity":0.0886,"poster_path":"/1L3nBQFD9douEDLD23Mw3XKFPlB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Illinois Central Transposed","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolee Schneemann","original_name":"Carolee Schneemann","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/1J4OvAVVJpgI3NzLSAzn2WQBYTN.jpg","credit_id":"5e9b3d53eec4f30025ac814a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1L3nBQFD9douEDLD23Mw3XKFPlB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"No Language\", \"english_name\"=>\"No Language\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"xx\", \"native_name\"=>\"No Language\"}","note":"","release_date":"1969-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
