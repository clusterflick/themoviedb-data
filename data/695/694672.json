The online playback will raise money for Broadway Cares’ COVID-19 Emergency Assistance Fund, which is helping everyone in the theater and performing arts community impacted by the pandemic and work shutdown.  Ryan McCartan (Frozen) hosted the stream live from his family’s home and will interview special Disney on Broadway stars, from their homes, throughout the evening.  The show also included a much-anticipated, high-energy reunion of 18 Newsies from the show’s Broadway and national touring productions, and a moving performance from Broadway Inspirational Voices.  The November concert was directed by Casey Hushion. James Abbott was the music director and created the revised orchestrations. Howard Joines was the orchestra coordinator. The creative team included lighting designer Ryan J. O’Gara and sound designers Kurt Fischer and Marie Renee Foucher.","popularity":0.4883,"poster_path":"/yXmt13BHuut2sA3hZZ6nblBcb9P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107038,"logo_path":"/vQWGWxJQXcK0qyZd26orU7ScUKe.png","name":"Disney Theatrical Group","origin_country":"US"},{"id":132427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reel Time Video Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Celebrating 25 Magical Years of Disney on Broadway","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Disney on Broadway: 25th Anniversary Concert for Broadway Cares' COVID-19 Emergency Assistance Fund","type":"2020 stream title"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1512789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan McCartan","original_name":"Ryan McCartan","popularity":0.3431,"profile_path":"/sHN3jMcf1LzEsuYWpDDWEhcwnY4.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self/Host","credit_id":"5e9b5d7c371097002247060f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2606420,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kurt Fischer","original_name":"Kurt Fischer","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9b5e5bd18fb900228f28c0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2606416,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Casey Hushion","original_name":"Casey Hushion","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9b5dc9fd6fa10024024052","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2606418,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tom Viola","original_name":"Tom Viola","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9b5e0ce22d28001d5ff689","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2606421,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Marie Renee Foucher","original_name":"Marie Renee Foucher","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9b5e70d18fb900228f28fb","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2606417,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeff Lee","original_name":"Jeff Lee","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9b5dfcfd6fa1002402406b","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2606419,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Ryan J.
