Is she impartial? Or is she blinkered? Friends take opposing briefs in a rape case. The key witness is a woman whose life seems a world away from theirs. At home, their own lives begin to unravel as every version of the truth is challenged.  Nina Raineâ€™s powerful, painful, funny play sifts the evidence from every side and puts justice herself in the dock.  Consent received its world premiere in a co-production with Out of Joint at the National Theatre in April 2017.
