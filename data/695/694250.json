In the 70s, he bought a super8 camera and started shooting home-movies with it. Through his lens we experience the seasons passing by in Priami, a small village on the Swiss-Italian border. With his cinematic eye, he explores the people around him, while a second point of view emerges, giving an interpretation of his world, his life and his sense of cinema. His relationship with masculinity and the missed relationship with the \"other sex\" is often highlighted, enhancing the conflict between the expectations of his community and the reality of not fitting in.","popularity":0.0861,"poster_path":"/5G6Zgz5QUN7u11Y8Mmzn68skRdY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Grand Viveur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2459933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Perla Sardella","original_name":"Perla Sardella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e99d09ed14443001252d8fb","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628737,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"I Conniventi","original_name":"I Conniventi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb403eff3e0df001f2aa257","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628736,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mario Lorenzini","original_name":"Mario Lorenzini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb403d00cb3350020c8a9d7","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2628738,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Marco Longo","original_name":"Marco Longo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb4040c0cb3350021c82912","department":"Art","job":"Title Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2459933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Perla Sardella","original_name":"Perla Sardella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5eb403e0c3514c001f54bc0c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12133702","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2828,"iso_639_1":"it","file_path":"/5G6Zgz5QUN7u11Y8Mmzn68skRdY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zRWjq2zOzdF2hpTGlmVsDN6jPtF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"Archivio Aperto","release_date":"2021-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"VdR2020 | Carte Blanche | Perla Sardella | Le Grand Viveur","key":"87ndm3bs6p8","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2020-04-18T09:54:05.000Z","id":"5ea0216d07faa20020fa4f9e"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Trailer | Le Grand Viveur | Perla Sardella","key":"1uT2i9v2PTc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-03-30T14:36:23.000Z","id":"5e9ee00a0ed2ab001de6d636"}]}}}
