The reservation is built on a polluted lake which is a tourist attraction. In Lorado there are many forms of love and every one keeps a pet. The story turns on the suicide of Fashionetteâ€™s fish, because of bad water conditions, and ends with a large scale chemical fire. This project took over three years to produce and all of the images are computer generated and animated.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/qaWxeqM7TTUv4gE48R4iCjY1X2c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maxwell's Demon","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Duesing","original_name":"James Duesing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9a2c97eb79c2001e5a3a83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1968589,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Duesing","original_name":"James Duesing","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9a2c9f85005d001e23c5bb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/6Lzo9D8F7dD6H4ZTbZsq5pMnoJD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qaWxeqM7TTUv4gE48R4iCjY1X2c.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ex09R6p2B6cX9LierxwdoTYCcpz.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ydGpo8dxuMNFIM63myIXIsulJUM.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Ann Arbor Film & Video Festival","release_date":"1991-03-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"San Francisco Cinematheque - I Hate the Internet: Techno-Dystopian Malaise and Visions of Rebellion","release_date":"2020-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
