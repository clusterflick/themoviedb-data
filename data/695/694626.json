This video presents the consistent relocation of these themes to suggest a cumulative continuity; from montage to montage, each motif is readjusted, repositioned, dismembered and remembered in new contexts. This video includes documentation of four installations: Venus Vectors (1989-98), Cycladic Imprints (1989-92), Scroll Paintings with Exploded TV (1990-91) and Video Rocks(1989-92).","popularity":0.0363,"poster_path":"/ai9zk3sZ8n7wBcoFz1xZ2po7psA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four Recent Installations","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1130573,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carolee Schneemann","original_name":"Carolee Schneemann","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/1J4OvAVVJpgI3NzLSAzn2WQBYTN.jpg","credit_id":"5e9b486396670e001e1d3ae4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ai9zk3sZ8n7wBcoFz1xZ2po7psA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"1993-04-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
