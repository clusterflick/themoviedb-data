None of the world's structures inspires as much admiration as the pyramids. Pyramids - in the deserts of Egypt and the Middle East, in the jungles of Mexico and in the American prairies - were built of stone as tombs of rulers or places of sacrificial rituals. They are silent witnesses of bygone times and extinct civilizations of antiquity.
