That’s when he began filming the people and events he could see from his kitchen window. The film was made on the basis of a dozen or more hours of footage shot during 1978–1999. The artist filmed the front yard of his block of flats in a part of Łódź called “Manhattan”—a cluster of tall, cement housing buildings vaguely resembling New York’s skyscrapers. The images are accompanied by the artist’s commentary, which brings the viewer closer to his neighbors and family, including his then-wife, Małgorzata Potocka. The film comments on the gradual yet profound political and social transformations that took place in Poland over these two decades.","popularity":0.0368,"poster_path":"/8OaKYuvuxluoh67yGMUHRlRKRXn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From My Window","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1607072,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Józef Robakowski","original_name":"Józef Robakowski","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9bdc71e22d2800226080b9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1441401","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.744,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8OaKYuvuxluoh67yGMUHRlRKRXn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1190}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pl","note":"","release_date":"1999-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Józef Robakowski   From My Window","key":"0NLNyShJcPs","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2019-09-20T14:05:08.000Z","id":"5fb576d9439be10040f90c2d"}]}}}
