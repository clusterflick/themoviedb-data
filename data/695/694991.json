Shot via Skype, it features those whose work was slated to screen at festivals like SXSW, CPH:DOX, Tribeca, First Look, and more. The documentary depicts a broad range of filmmakers, each sequestered in their own spaces in locations throughout North America, Europe, Africa, and beyond, responding to a question first posed by Wim Wenders in his classic 1982 documentary experiment Room 666, and perhaps newly resonant today: “Is cinema becoming a dead language—an art form which is already in decline?”","popularity":0.0534,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Room H.264: Quarantine, April 2020","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":937892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Reichert","original_name":"Jeff Reichert","popularity":0.0686,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9cd2813103250021c9380c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1876397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Hynes","original_name":"Eric Hynes","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9cd25ccf4b8b001dca1528","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1787888,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Damon Smith","original_name":"Damon Smith","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e9cd29e680be80026c56293","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13823690","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
