Dating from an early appearance in 1940 – his first meeting with Elmer Fudd in “Elmer’s Candid Camera” all the way through 1954, this Looney Tunes anthology features many firsts – such as the first appearance of the Tasmanian Devil in “Devil May Hare” and Bugs’s first close encounter with a nameless Martian (later named Marvin) and his pet dog K-9 in “Haredevil Hare.” And Bugs’s sparring with Yosemite Sam runs throughout this collection – as they meet during the Gold Rush (“14 Carrot Rabbit”), in a prison (“Big House Bunny”), and on the high-seas as pirates (“Buccaneer Bunny”). But that’s not all folks… there are some thugs after Bugs for a good-luck charm; and Bugs becomes both the Masked Marauder Carrot Thief and a rabbit sandwich! What’s up, Doc? Your spirits, with this must-have collection!","popularity":0.0484,"poster_path":"/lPgx9nDmj5xNOBVdNiqkV7EMRyR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looney Tunes Collection: Best of Bugs Bunny Volume 3","video":true,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lPgx9nDmj5xNOBVdNiqkV7EMRyR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2005-10-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
