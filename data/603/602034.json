Israel is the country most famous for this strategy, having initiated it as part of a rebranding campaign has been engaged in for the last decade. In 2012, activists in the Pacific Northwestern region of the US responded to an Israeli Consulate-funded pinkwashing tour featuring Israeli gay and lesbian activists that was coming to the region. Local queer Palestine solidarity activists exposed the \"Rainbow Generations\" tour as pro-Israel propaganda and got some of the events, including the tour's centerpiece event hosted by the City of Seattle's LGBT Commission, cancelled. A significant backlash ensued involving the Seattle City Council and Seattle's leading LGBT and HIV organizations. Through the inspiring story of these activists' victory, Pinkwashing Exposed explores how pinkwashing works.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":"/v94p1kfsKbKVoNyIxdUlIpRhUqL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pinkwashing Exposed: Seattle Fights Back!","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2311252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dean Spade","original_name":"Dean Spade","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd8740f9251412486cf1094","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5944670","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7HQyHugG0wxTdAHnXXtmob7bGFX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1d7IrKhkULccGOtIHgy4LeGHRUl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":881,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/v94p1kfsKbKVoNyIxdUlIpRhUqL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":595}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Seoul Human Right Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2015-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
