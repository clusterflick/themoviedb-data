Sunny, Violet, Jacosta, Pauline... What's to keep her from changing again and leaving her friends and fiance behind? Who's the odd man in the hat and why did he bring a birdcage to a bar? Does the hot bartender really exist? The group fractures, seeking answers to these questions over the course of one surreal night. A film about identity and history and what people choose to reveal to each other.","popularity":0.3047,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":118334,"logo_path":null,"name":"From the Hip
