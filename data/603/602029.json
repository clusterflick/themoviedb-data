The two birds are out for a leisurely stroll, playing music together and taking selfies until a hungry cat attempts to spoil their fun. After several unique and imaginative evasive maneuvers, the birds pelt the cat with apple bombs. The film is one of the jewels of the cartoon: the Czech tradition, Disney anthropomorphism and innovative pre-electronic music score.","popularity":0.1478,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2329,"logo_path":null,"name":"Krátký film Praha","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1965-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Birds that flew only when they were in danger\"","title":"Strange Birds","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","title":"KohakBirds","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1183243,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jiří Jelínek","original_name":"Jiří Jelínek","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Singing (voice)","credit_id":"5ce46c8292514179f4b94be6","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1512310,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Václav Strnad","original_name":"Václav Strnad","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6258654913a32000a3a5faf2","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2033736,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Emil Strakoň","original_name":"Emil Strakoň","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6258652643cd540161810d2a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1820083,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jiří Šebestík","original_name":"Jiří Šebestík","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625865403acd2000509fa5db","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1315132,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Josef Hekrdla","original_name":"Josef Hekrdla","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625864c743cd540161810bd7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1303629,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Štěpán Koníček","original_name":"Štěpán Koníček","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625864d8c92c5d0050abee6f","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2311250,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jiří Toman","original_name":"Jiří Toman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"625864b7b6abc40065f481d9","department":"Art","job":"Art Direction"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2311248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimír Lehký","original_name":"Vladimír Lehký","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd8739e9251412b3fcf1936","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1496255,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Květa Mašková","original_name":"Květa Mašková","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd875819251412f6bcf2489","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1247712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lubomír Beneš","original_name":"Lubomír Beneš","popularity":0.1387,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd8706f0e0a2659cdcbe61a","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2311248,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vladimír Lehký","original_name":"Vladimír Lehký","popularity":0.0457,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd86f090e0a2659cdcbe43d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2311250,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jiří Toman","original_name":"Jiří Toman","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cd873afc3a3684a97c1e159","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0208383","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/f4aPWMlCWsl4et4H0zmXtWSQcRY.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":12999,"name":"black and white"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-06-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
