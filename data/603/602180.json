But Nico wasn’t an alpinist like the many others with him that morning. He conquered the highest summit of Europe after a no-stop riding almost 17h long, started the day before by bicycle from a beach in Genoa. The first Mont Blanc 24 hour record was beaten by Marino Giacometti in 1997 (23hrs) and subsequently by Andrea Daprai in 2008 (18 hrs 58’). From that day on, Nico launched the project “From Zero To…” and continued to add records and summits (Aconcagua, Elbrus, Kilimanjaro). ”Summit” tells all the efforts that Nico and his team have made for making possible this epic challenge.","popularity":0.2908,"poster_path":"/5T1tUHKkFmAGHU5pg96N2mJEJ1s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103361,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mooz Films","origin_country":"LB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nico Valsesia - From Zero To Monte Bianco - Summit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","title":"Summit","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2999491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nico Valsesia","original_name":"Nico Valsesia","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"620cb8070dea6e006c55998f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3429014,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luca Vismara","original_name":"Luca Vismara","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"620cb82466eba7006acf859a","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1397752,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Morgan Bertacca","original_name":"Morgan Bertacca","popularity":0.0742,"profile_path":"/gH3nlTtJ7bHNoL0E8kCJp7Ehiaq.jpg","credit_id":"5cd990b3c3a36836f6c17c02","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2961486","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vfBiuZNSgi4zZQJpLp8Ygg6trtc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/5T1tUHKkFmAGHU5pg96N2mJEJ1s.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1066}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2540,"name":"alp"},{"id":4560,"name":"mountaineer"},{"id":8624,"name":"climbing"},{"id":180491,"name":"cycling"},{"id":220014,"name":"alpinism"},{"id":250025,"name":"alpinist"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
