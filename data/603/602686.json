In Shugendō (The Way of Acquiring Power), practitioners perform ritual actions from shamanism, Shintō, Daoism, and Tantric Buddhism. They seek experiential truth of the teachings during arduous climbs in sacred mountains. Through the peace and beauty of the natural world, practitioners purify the six roots of perception, revitalize their energy and reconnect with their truest nature — all while grasping the fundamental interconnectedness with nature and all sentient beings.","popularity":0.1709,"poster_path":"/rjxajuU5vuvmSNHtVN6EnmOx8Qq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Everywhere You Go You Can Find A Sacred Mountain","title":"Shugendô Now","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Shugendo Now","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2314173,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-Marc Abela","original_name":"Jean-Marc Abela","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cdd5487c3a36836f6c82308","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2314175,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mark Patrick McGuire","original_name":"Mark Patrick McGuire","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5cdd549d0e0a265493cbd13b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1467071","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.687,"height":1455,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rjxajuU5vuvmSNHtVN6EnmOx8Qq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.709,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tcSuYPonUeFFnJOnDVgcvoy007C.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1063}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":188,"name":"buddhism"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"International Buddhist Film Festival","release_date":"2010-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Shugendô Now trailer","key":"KdqwkzRNguw","site":"YouTube","size":480,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2009-08-07T16:21:03.000Z","id":"5cdd5647c3a36829b8c0118a"}]}}}
