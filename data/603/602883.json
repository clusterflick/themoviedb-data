In the story, the anger, loneliness, despair and longings of 15 year old Gamze meets the audience with a perspective not taken before.. Hale, who is about thirty five years old (named Gamze when she was a child), begins to open the doors of her past that she had kept securely close with the surprise proposal of her boyfriend Engin.It is hard for Hale to be human, to love other people and truly be herself. As Hale started to face her past slowly, she starts to become a more warm person. Neither the rains, nor Engin can erase the past. Hale would get over her past with facing her childhood Gamze.","popularity":0.1697,"poster_path":"/lgrqpHOCX9KdcMwo3Qf55tWgbWz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wish to Wash with Rain","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1576294,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yeliz Tozan","original_name":"Yeliz Tozan","popularity":0.1049,"profile_path":"/vskrZokVbytkeDgnXQQ15dpT6me.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Hale","credit_id":"63c13ecfdf857c008141aa2e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3552154,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Derin İnce","original_name":"Derin İnce","popularity":0.1025,"profile_path":"/9dK64wRhvwl6t0Ihma9nv44aY22.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gamze","credit_id":"63c13edaa5743d00891046ac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1322641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murat Ergür","original_name":"Murat Ergür","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/axB1uGjcDsOAlGo6huITOZ7P6DN.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Engin","credit_id":"63c13ee623be4600b2f1565c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1489030,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Engin Benli","original_name":"Engin Benli","popularity":0.3104,"profile_path":"/cMbR0duZ6rl7wW2to4KsI7LiatM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Yılmaz","credit_id":"63c13f6bdf857c00d9c10f4f","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1604769,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Müge Ulusoy","original_name":"Müge Ulusoy","popularity":0.1206,"profile_path":"/3UdY330cCMvkbdUxhONfdFMeasa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Fazilet","credit_id":"63c13f74df857c0089278d68","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1998081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Çiğdem Benli","original_name":"Çiğdem Benli","popularity":0.0674,"profile_path":"/c8LxS7Af7vCGqM9Q1iQR64D2ITO.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Melike","credit_id":"63c13f80e16e5a008191fff0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3557869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rabia Cemre Kaya","original_name":"Rabia Cemre Kaya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Merve","credit_id":"63c13fb4df857c0089278d75","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3116156,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gülçin Çakır","original_name":"Gülçin Çakır","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Selin","credit_id":"63c13fc5df857c00bc21a18b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3322028,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bilgin Ertok","original_name":"Bilgin Ertok","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Şenay Abla","credit_id":"63c13fcedf857c008141aa85","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2774379,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gülten Taranç","original_name":"Gülten Taranç","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f5c4c94ec0c580036a6c2ce","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5680476","wikidata_id":"Q28864620","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"tr","file_path":"/lgrqpHOCX9KdcMwo3Qf55tWgbWz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"tr","note":"","release_date":"2016-05-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
