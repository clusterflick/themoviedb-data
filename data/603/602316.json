However, the equally important protagonist of the play \"Don't Bet on the English\" - the protagonist who is both inside and outside them - is one of the essential demons of human nature: a passion for gambling, more precisely betting. An emerging form of this obsessive passion is, for Djurdjevic's heroes, betting on the results of matches of various national football leagues.","popularity":0.1514,"poster_path":"/yEL3ONM3y7nLawBAnIaJRGuHtkA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63904,"logo_path":"/fKDAYIJat7fpbWnjgdHchpg5AbQ.png","name":"Fakultet Dramskih Umetnosti Beograd (FDU)","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2018-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Bet on the Brits","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1361869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denis Murić","original_name":"Denis Murić","popularity":0.1138,"profile_path":"/4DxwowWeBn1TI7MRYqSZa3gEoLP.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1754bc1d01910017f238cb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2505211,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Ninčić","original_name":"Ivan Ninčić","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1754c5cf4b8b001381f4f4","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2103287,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marko Vasiljević","original_name":"Marko Vasiljević","popularity":0.1335,"profile_path":"/4AEr8L033tZpMqRizuCis7Tz823.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5e1754cd1d01910017f238ce","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1827328,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marko Marković","original_name":"Marko Marković","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1754ae1d01910015f2391b","department":"Writing","job":"Adaptation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1846911,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Vladimir Đurđević","original_name":"Vladimir Đurđević","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e17548ac2f44b0014bf0d9e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2103292,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maša Šarović","original_name":"Maša Šarović","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5e1754911d01910013f22971","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt9447954","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":"sr","file_path":"/yEL3ONM3y7nLawBAnIaJRGuHtkA.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":706}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
