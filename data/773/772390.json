A chief minister who used his position to smash the Roman Catholic church in England and loot the monasteries for his own gain. A man who used torture to bring about the execution of the woman who had once been his friend and supporter - Anne Boleyn.  Diarmaid MacCulloch, professor of the history of the church at Oxford University, reveals a very different image of Cromwell.  He describes Cromwell as an evangelical reformer, determined to break the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic church and introduce the people of England to a new type of Christianity in which each individual makes direct contact with God.","popularity":0.2804,"poster_path":"/w25mR3trOYzVMcLFSobC0aDXqOr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Henry VIII's Enforcer: The Rise and Fall of Thomas Cromwell","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1254062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diarmaid MacCulloch","original_name":"Diarmaid MacCulloch","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/j5fqKAEKv3NTdv8Hy9uzI5I1rPc.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"5fcab43be32943003d3cdffd","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1237822,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Granlund","original_name":"Chris Granlund","popularity":0.0676,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62c3f0cf2da84600817c60b6","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":212490,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Colville","original_name":"Charles Colville","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcab4aba5743d0041041b1c","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1254062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diarmaid MacCulloch","original_name":"Diarmaid MacCulloch","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/j5fqKAEKv3NTdv8Hy9uzI5I1rPc.jpg","credit_id":"5fcab4d6dcf8750042405519","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":212490,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charles Colville","original_name":"Charles Colville","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fcab47ed8e225003f9183cf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6350208","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/w25mR3trOYzVMcLFSobC0aDXqOr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":208244,"name":"16th century"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
