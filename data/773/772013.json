It confidently breaks with the rules of staging docudrama with an unsparing look at Alma’s love life, unfakeable scene bohemianism and extensive location footage of Mexico before NAFTA and after the 1985 earthquake. “I feel like no one is supporting me,” Alma says. “Guys want everything and give nothing in return. Isn’t that so?” Like NADIE ES INOCENTE, this film uses the intimacy and flexibility of video (this time, 3/4″) to wring innovation in the editing room, this time to give Alma a similarly alienated and jittery headspace.","popularity":0.0721,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alma punk","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3027136,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ciro Basilio","original_name":"Ciro Basilio","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"605f50991130bd00555aebbd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3027137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Hernandez","original_name":"Ana Hernandez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"605f50a8b7b69d003dcc1870","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3027138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marco Pavon","original_name":"Marco Pavon","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"605f50b61130bd006c7d9ca8","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1413388,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sarah Minter","original_name":"Sarah Minter","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/tzFycvKhsB7zSYDcuXIPsw7iZCt.jpg","credit_id":"605f51267c6de300538fbfeb","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3027141,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Marie-Christine Camus","original_name":"Marie-Christine Camus","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605f511c7c6de300538fbfe7","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1413388,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sarah Minter","original_name":"Sarah Minter","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/tzFycvKhsB7zSYDcuXIPsw7iZCt.jpg","credit_id":"605f508c23be4600539a82d6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1413388,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sarah Minter","original_name":"Sarah Minter","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/tzFycvKhsB7zSYDcuXIPsw7iZCt.jpg","credit_id":"605f50846f6a99006af8ef82","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3027140,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Monica Lombardo","original_name":"Monica Lombardo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605f50f70e64af00540da4ec","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3027137,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ana Hernandez","original_name":"Ana Hernandez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605f50d1b84f94003d13138e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3027139,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Paula Capra","original_name":"Paula Capra","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"605f50ead2f5b5006a2276bd","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1413388,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sarah Minter","original_name":"Sarah Minter","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/tzFycvKhsB7zSYDcuXIPsw7iZCt.jpg","credit_id":"605f51031130bd00555aecb7","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0430883","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
