For this release, baritone Hermann Prey tackles Schubert's Die Schone Mullerin, Schwanengesang accompanied by Leonard Hokanson and Winterreise accompanied by Helmut Deutsch. As a bonus, this release includes an interview with Prey on these song cycles and a documentary on the artist. \"In his finest interpretations Hermann Prey sang \"Winterreise\" and \"Die schone Mullerin\" with a captivatingly natural phrasing that flowed organically like a river and as such was the very opposite of the more intellectual approach of his rival, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.\" (Die Zeit online) \"The velvety, silky timbre of his soft-grained and yet distinctively striking baritone voice, his charm, his excellent diction and the naturalness of his delivery spiced with a hint of emotion- it is all this that distinguishes the truly outstanding lieder singer.\" (Opernglas).","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/ndAYmFwoUl69TDR9mXm2DS7sTY0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Franz Schubert","title":"The Schubert Song Cycles (Hermann Prey)","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ndAYmFwoUl69TDR9mXm2DS7sTY0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
