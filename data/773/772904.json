A girl appears and holds up a red piece of paper with the words \"A woman who should never have been given a name in the first place\" written on it. From this point on, a dozen or so high school students act out a play and a flood of words using the red drawing paper begins, and a spy drama proceeds simultaneously. The film is an homage to Godard and Kurosawa Kiyoshi, and is notable for its forceful narrative, which seems to want to destroy the film.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tBCmH8Ly0POfsddXkmnggFuLoeu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT MOVIE","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toyoshi Tsuji","original_name":"Toyoshi Tsuji","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c89cd28d52c9001b9e23b7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toyoshi Tsuji","original_name":"Toyoshi Tsuji","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c89ceff5f1c50061b83305","department":"Crew","job":"Script"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toyoshi Tsuji","original_name":"Toyoshi Tsuji","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c89cfe63a6950019de20b3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3359211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Toyoshi Tsuji","original_name":"Toyoshi Tsuji","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61c89d0466a0d30041cfd3a2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tBCmH8Ly0POfsddXkmnggFuLoeu.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.751,"height":1155,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lidzcJhQcJCTYQb9dE1YzjMFyUV.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":867}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1984-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
