In 24 places, as a transit over the course of a day (Morning, Day, Night) a map of terror is drawn where massacres took place in Colombia in the 1990s. Archival images, the artists’ personal memories and the use of loops and analogue materials bring to life the landscapes ravaged by violence and build a polyphony of memory and mourning, a universal song of pain.","popularity":0.2957,"poster_path":"/3Kp3d6DpXVnKlt1U5l6IgYnQklm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2021-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"an iteration of violence","title":"Song of the Flies","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Song of  the Flies","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2411031,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bibiana Rojas Gómez","original_name":"Bibiana Rojas Gómez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/5LCpYvG9uUCmcONsLF73KjRfecS.jpg","credit_id":"6230047cc8f85800472f3597","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2214637,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Cecilia Traslaviña","original_name":"Cecilia Traslaviña","popularity":0.0445,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"623004950328b9004622eaaf","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3263985,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ana María Vallejo","original_name":"Ana María Vallejo","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/z42s4gSmwZHM3PMin8VNGdvuthx.jpg","credit_id":"61614227e004a600864d108d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":true,"gender":0,"id":3117220,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carolina Lucio","original_name":"Carolina Lucio","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634dc9d289f749007d6a0979","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3745264,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Alejandra Arboleda","original_name":"Alejandra Arboleda","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634dc9eac9044c0091a3d4e7","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3745265,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Laura Victoria Delgado","original_name":"Laura Victoria Delgado","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634dca0bec0c5800792d2e02","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1668367,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Diana Menestrey S.","original_name":"Diana Menestrey S.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634dca1dd6dbba007aa74a07","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2131109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sandra Reyes","original_name":"Sandra Reyes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634dca3ac9044c007a6a8eb6","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3745266,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Catalina Giraldo Vélez","original_name":"Catalina Giraldo Vélez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634dca55c175b2007f81c032","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Animation"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3745268,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Manuela Puerto","original_name":"Manuela Puerto","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"634dca8a389da10081cdeeaa","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":"elcantodelasmoscas","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3Kp3d6DpXVnKlt1U5l6IgYnQklm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1446}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":496,"name":"poetry"},{"id":9872,"name":"grief"},{"id":14546,"name":"massacre"},{"id":273967,"name":"war"},{"id":285275,"name":"colombia"},{"id":296721,"name":"experimental animation"},{"id":302435,"name":"poesía"},{"id":305114,"name":"colombian armed conflict"},{"id":305115,"name":"maria mercedes carranza"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Tricky Women Tricky Realities","release_date":"2022-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]},{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Bogota Short Film Festival -
