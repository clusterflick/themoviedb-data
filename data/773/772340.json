Noah, a 21 years old college student has been traumatized by guns since his childhood, ever since his little brother (Elijah) was killed when they were involved in an innocent tussle with a firearm on Noah's 6th birthday. 15 years later, on his highly unfavorable birthday, Noah is faced with a series of events that question his Gun-Free oath. He is taunted by his best friend possessing a new firearm, discovering his sister's (Charmaine) boyfriend is secretly plotting to set her up, as well as dealing with the anxiety of aggressive police officers paying a visit to his mother's home.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/ysKRYoXm4F3mfeRE2jwjG2z5FqR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Know Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2881581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleem Mahdi","original_name":"Aleem Mahdi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fca945adcf875004140e45c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2881583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Najeeb Muhammad","original_name":"Najeeb Muhammad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fca9468e1ad790041f73a0b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2881581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aleem Mahdi","original_name":"Aleem Mahdi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fca9473e1ad79003ef73b84","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2881583,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Najeeb Muhammad","original_name":"Najeeb Muhammad","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5fca947e383df2003d587988","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt12825042","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/ysKRYoXm4F3mfeRE2jwjG2z5FqR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/iPr8RZawCAizaqP4SVAhwtMewEV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"{\"folded_name\"=>\"English\", \"english_name\"=>\"English\", \"iso_639_1\"=>\"en\", \"native_name\"=>\"English\"}","note":"","release_date":"2020-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
