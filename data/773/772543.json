Verismo prides itself on its realism, but rarely are its operas based on a true story.  Francesco Cilea’s most popular work took its inspiration from the well-documented career and death of Adrienne Lecouvreur, a celebrated actress of the early eighteenth century. Her performances were a revelation. She brought a realism to the parts she played that had rarely been seen before her.","popularity":0.0361,"poster_path":"/vexnTL1kWjFFNWt6DIGe5bk2Kad.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Francesco Cilea","title":"Francesco Cilea - Adriana Lecouvreur","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vexnTL1kWjFFNWt6DIGe5bk2Kad.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
