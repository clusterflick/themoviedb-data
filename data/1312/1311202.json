There, he is forced to study under the only piano teacher his father can find – the eccentric, enigmatic Herr Keller, a Viennese refugee with a shadowed past.

Does he come from a lineage of great European pianists, or is he a fraud?","popularity":0.3236,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":71265,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scarlet Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":94107,"logo_path":null,"name":"MMC Movies","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":45491,"logo_path":null,"name":"CineVista Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"This is a film about music, the music within us.","title":"Maestro","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"マエストロ","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10647,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Klaus Maria Brandauer","original_name":"Klaus Maria Brandauer","popularity":0.2571,"profile_path":"/mE4polIdi4QdzDvIuHgfM37n7l9.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Herr Keller","credit_id":"66826c34af35d291ce4e7c9e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1109111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madeleine Madden","original_name":"Madeleine Madden","popularity":1.0911,"profile_path":"/oOZ1EJeq2DHxNNLAkLEyYYOlqlM.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Rosie","credit_id":"66826c424b4e17da8f3ada55","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":964834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Dillane","original_name":"Frank Dillane","popularity":0.707,"profile_path":"/sXcn4QnEzvPFV9OiKLvPRyVr7RN.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Paul Crabbe","credit_id":"66826cc64f24e7e982178047","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4804282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Jarvis","original_name":"Catherine Jarvis","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66826be2d22104a67fce1530","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1322967,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Goldsworthy","original_name":"Peter Goldsworthy","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66826c1a70eace5dc91e45e3","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4804282,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Jarvis","original_name":"Catherine Jarvis","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66826c2471ac33f2e517816e","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3532290","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5657,"name":"australia"},{"id":818,"name":"based on novel or book"},{"id":5783,"name":"classical music"},{"id":18267,"name":"vienna, austria"},{"id":164148,"name":"dark past"},{"id":196135,"name":"eccentric artist"},{"id":207592,"name":"piano"},{"id":208992,"name":"1960s"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
