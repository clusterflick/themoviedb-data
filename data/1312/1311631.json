From behind-the-scenes with an acclaimed Yiddish-language version of Yentl in Melbourne, to enjoyably transgressive punk-Klezmer musicians, and Barrie Kosky’s latest trailblazing production in Berlin – the endangered Yiddish language is alive and well in this rousing documentary. The language originated amongst the Jewish community in Eastern Europe, but almost disappeared when more than half of the world’s Yiddish speakers were murdered during the Holocaust. Most of the artists and performers (aka Yiddishists) in the film didn’t grow up speaking Yiddish, but all have found solace, identity, and inspiration in its rich traditions and culture. Ros Horin has mapped a fascinating cultural history.","popularity":0.1876,"poster_path":"/qqTbY4wuMghYtj9sY87OCKHTPPu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94549,"logo_path":"/cw41bmA1NpxfLyRHMDHbc9bJdmL.png","name":"Common Room Productions","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":134820,"logo_path":null,"name":"Racing Pulse Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":7584,"logo_path":"/eGkfvvyf4fJTvBUR1xt1669IPA3.png","name":"Screen Australia","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":204763,"logo_path":"/aqWMgtLOf2ClBDnK0f4DvYNTZf6.png","name":"VicScreen","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":10951,"logo_path":"/jxfMNlkvI3GxnS41xCSOLD7goVb.png","name":"Screen NSW","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":92036,"logo_path":"/yzevqr6GX0Y2hJT2rXsQhuJgNYH.png","name":"Documentary Australia Foundation","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2024-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welcome to Yiddishland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4942801,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Kahn","original_name":"Daniel Kahn","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66e6205fdd224d1a39911943","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1675075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ros Horin","original_name":"Ros Horin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66dce59cd1b6aaf74d6d0fb7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1675075,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ros Horin","original_name":"Ros Horin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e61e01050f14e4fccf3f22","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4942788,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeff Daniels","original_name":"Jeff Daniels","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e61e3a050f14e4fccf3f3f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4942789,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Joe Skrzynski","original_name":"Joe Skrzynski","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e61e669dfbbdf0e6cf3cc5","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2411526,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steven Robinson","original_name":"Steven Robinson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e61ea4e8211ecd22b04a7b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2411526,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steven Robinson","original_name":"Steven Robinson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e61ebae8211ecd22b04a81","department":"Writing","job":"Co-Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1190315,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kathryn Milliss","original_name":"Kathryn Milliss","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e61ee7050f14e4fccf3f81","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2611313,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jaspar Techel","original_name":"Jaspar Techel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e61ef9d7bcca524db04dd9","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2124609,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Sam Weiss","original_name":"Sam Weiss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e61f17050f14e4fccf3f9e","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32330697","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.705,"height":922,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/qqTbY4wuMghYtj9sY87OCKHTPPu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":650}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":235390,"name":"yiddish language"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Sydney Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"MA 15+","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jewish International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Welcome to Yiddishland | Trailer SFF 24","key":"3a1sqQpKYmw","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2024-05-13T00:16:49.000Z","id":"66dce5f72e6520503efe1d70"}]}}}
