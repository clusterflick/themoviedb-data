That of Hannah Arendt, a poem of whose, written in honour of Walter Benjamin in 1942, is read in voice-over as we see images of walls and deserted streets in an abandoned village: Oradour-sur-Glane. That of Ulrike Meinhof, speaking of womenâ€™s position with regards to political commitment, or the survival of fascism in post-war Germany, as we see a woman in a cell akin to that of the political activist. Two german women, both of whom fought against nazism and its aftermath; two evocations of state violence and the struggles it engenders; two decentred frames that cover each other in turn, contaminate and pollinate one another in a palimpsest of eras of resistance.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Distant Voices","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1962877,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Annik Leroy","original_name":"Annik Leroy","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/r3aUcyIgAP3fD3nOgp1DUTfgzPv.jpg","credit_id":"66825f1efc9dba48db178182","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2014610,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Julie Morel","original_name":"Julie Morel","popularity":0.0347,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66825f7371ac33f2e51780f6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FIDMarseille","release_date":"2024-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
