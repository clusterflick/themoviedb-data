A sneaky fight that takes place in loneliness and distress ignored by all. Between the voice that screams \"don't eat\" and the one that begs \"love me\", Joanny, Catherine and Annick talk to us, in Duel en 2 voix, about this much sought-after balance and the pitfalls that lie in their way. But beyond the voices that respond to each other in a duel every day, it sometimes happens that we begin to become aware of the life that surrounds us. On this day, the disease takes up less space.","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/ilf100Kvn3NmxNeBToDfJCL1QVH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":232617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vidéo-Femmes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2006-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Duel en 2 voix","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Veaux-Logeat","original_name":"Catherine Veaux-Logeat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668246df2c01de627265ab39","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1525211,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Veaux-Logeat","original_name":"Catherine Veaux-Logeat","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668246e55e1a85dc4fce12b9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20949726","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.672,"height":1410,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ilf100Kvn3NmxNeBToDfJCL1QVH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":948}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2006-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
