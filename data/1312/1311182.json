With precise vision and painstaking composition, the director offers three variations to reflect upon the relationship between the human body, medical technology and aesthetic representation. The camera crosses the sterilised space of the hospital, revealing a disturbing contiguity between the perspectives of machines and humans, the handiwork of surgeons and that of robots. In a way that’s both fascinating and challenging, the film delves into the realm of medical technology, which seems to cancel out the distance between the body and its representation.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blue Flower in the Land of Technology","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4804202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Albert García-Alzórriz i Guardiola","original_name":"Julie Morel","popularity":0.0511,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66826076aec89e4c84766976","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"FIDMarseille","release_date":"2024-06-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
