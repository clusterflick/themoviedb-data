Having won five Paralympic medals, Weggemann is now not only looking to reclaim her spot on the podium, but she’s trying to become a mother as well.  In WATERSHED, which was self-documented by Weggemann and her husband Jay Snyder, Weggemann trains for the Tokyo Paralympics during COVID-19 and battles an additional injury to her arm, putting her career in question. Against the backdrop of these crossroads, the couple bravely share their struggles with infertility, the importance of IVF, and their journey to start a family.  In this deeply personal and inspiring film, Weggemann reminds us that trauma and tragedy not only change how we are perceived by society, but how we perceive ourselves. And that if we’re brave enough, we too can write our own ending.","popularity":1.5189,"poster_path":"/oFDA7T5pYIs8nwIRuOfXLLVv5XH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":232702,"logo_path":null,"name":"TFA
