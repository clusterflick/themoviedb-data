Returning from the puppets' graveyard, both Punch and Pretty Polly go in search of Judy. Once re-united, these former stars enact their tragi-comedy one last time. Becoming increasingly violent, the most primaeval of all English folk dramas reaches a gloved climax. All of the stock characters play their part - whether Punch, Judy, the Baby, Pretty Polly, the Devil, Scaramouch, Clown Joey, the Policeman, Beadle, Doctor, Dragon, Hobby-horse, Crocodile, Minister, Hangman, Toby Dog, the Bottler or an invisible Professor. How will it end? Shall our puppets come to grief? Who's going to give the Bottler sixpence at the close? Root-toot-toot.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grand Guignol","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2496215,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Bowden","original_name":"Jonathan Bowden","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668468a691f58d44891e683d","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
