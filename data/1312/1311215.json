Using Antonin Dvorak’s NEW WORLD SYMPHONY as an interpretive point for this for this film essay, Richard Mangan presents an array of nature images to parallel the evolution of life on the Eart.  Using color separations, jump cuts, filters, pixilation and layered images, the appearance of a new life form supersedes each previous life form with a new and greater plateau of consciousness.  Eventually, a city appears with its myriad of intricate constructs, and finally, in the last moments of the film, mankind itself appear, culminating the Earth’s evolutionary consciousness to date.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Impressions of the New World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"16mm","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
