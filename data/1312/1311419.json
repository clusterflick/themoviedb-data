True to his word, Mister Butch died in the street in 2007. He was missed by many. I flew back to Boston for his memorial parade, I think there were like 1000 people in the street. To make this little no budget movie I had help from Amy Whitten, Jenny Tse, Jennet Cook, Star Nigro, James Ryan, and Nathan Lewis Hughes, among others.\"","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Searching for Mr. Butch","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3056185,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"S G Collins","original_name":"S G Collins","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/48tz1AHZvhKbOa5knZUlYn3sEnR.jpg","credit_id":"66830573e64c230dee268b53","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
