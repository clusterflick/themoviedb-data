Their worlds are upended by WWII, with Shibata facing internment in the Rockies, while Robinson is pushed from his lifelong home in Japan amidst growing intolerance. Charting their transformative journeys, the documentary captures their resilience and the indelible marks left by displacement. Through their stories, it reflects on the Japanese Canadian struggle from a new perspective and redefines what it means to find home against a backdrop of war and loss.","popularity":0.0748,"poster_path":"/bPYdMDJCYtKyXEUnYyMLFcXkcgt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Landscapes of Home","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4857163,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Ryusuke Shibata","original_name":"Henry Ryusuke Shibata","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"66a8b65db271fff9d2a36d0e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1200840,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Eric Kramer","original_name":"Michael Eric Kramer","popularity":0.1706,"profile_path":"/2JluTOzrs0zYVWGnTaFbD3zhhl7.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Stuart Cooper Robinson","credit_id":"66a8b6df5dbec31537ebc525","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4806507,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alice Il Shin","original_name":"Alice Il Shin","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66841ba984dc1e385efb1c1a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1414,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/bPYdMDJCYtKyXEUnYyMLFcXkcgt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Toronto Japanese Film Festival","release_date":"2024-06-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EBS International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"12","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"EBS International Documentary Festival","release_date":"2024-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
