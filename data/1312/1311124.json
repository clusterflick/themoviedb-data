Emerging as 'best performer' among the hopefuls at Hammond's audition, Duncan is offered a starring role in his next production. Attempting to keep his new career secret from his friends and flatmates is hard enough but when Duncan falls for the charms of his co-star Emily DuBois (Melissa Bell) and strangers start recognising him, Duncan surrenders and embraces his infamy as 'Duncan the Spunkman'. Trouble follows when villainous rival porn producer Angelo Dmitri (Terry Serio) attempts to undermine Hammond's business and sabotage Duncan's career.","popularity":0.5243,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Money Shot","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75718,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Teo Gebert","original_name":"Teo Gebert","popularity":0.1518,"profile_path":"/q3mZYQOtSoEE41x0iDgR2gjOLJs.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Duncan Wiley","credit_id":"66822488fc9dba48db177961","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Bonner","original_name":"Tony Bonner","popularity":0.3378,"profile_path":"/rCULDceBF4gIp05O139eZwRVLHS.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Roger Hammond","credit_id":"66822496daf75d2239dd5fe8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Serio","original_name":"Terry Serio","popularity":0.1319,"profile_path":"/o6lf5YvXubPRyU8ehbmhn4Kogae.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Angelo Dmitri","credit_id":"668224ac7cfdcef362dc6f61","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4803904,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Julian Saggers","original_name":"Julian Saggers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668224fed8ca24584f34c21d","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4803905,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jason Gooden","original_name":"Jason Gooden","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6682250a70794d6375f17765","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-02-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
