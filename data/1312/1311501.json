The film is at its roots an Old Testament tragedy. Shot in stark high contrast black and white the film bears resemblance to classic film noirs and the genre of the Road Movie. The otherworldly Irish landscape, long tracking shots and the hallucinogenic blues soundtrack lend the film a peculiar rhythm and atmosphere.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/efsGx6iraNZGa9QUgN7xl2aAEst.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Road to Nod","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1496527,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Delaney Davidson","original_name":"Delaney Davidson","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Parrish","credit_id":"668354328098f8fa031b87c0","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4805547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Noiret","original_name":"Dominique Noiret","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Polly","credit_id":"66835444583d92db5d220a40","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4805548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beatman","original_name":"Beatman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Reverend","credit_id":"66835452efbfcbaef9bc5ec3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4805550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Hughes","original_name":"Chris Hughes","popularity":0.047,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Jim","credit_id":"668354709b1a115531468871","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061390,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"M.A. Littler","original_name":"M.A. Littler","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66835492838a7818e69b17a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4805552,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David Meves","original_name":"David Meves","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668354ab70eace5dc91e5a71","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061390,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"M.A. Littler","original_name":"M.A. Littler","popularity":0.0495,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6683549c215400b97304071c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/efsGx6iraNZGa9QUgN7xl2aAEst.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
