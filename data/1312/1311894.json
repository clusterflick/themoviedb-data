The crowd is noisy, they are trying to rip off the governor's shoulder straps, his assistants have difficulty pulling him out of the crowd and taking him into the house. Stones are flying through the windows. The governor goes out onto the balcony and takes out a handkerchief. The soldiers standing in the cordon are nervous, and a careless wave of the governor’s handkerchief is interpreted as an order to open fire. As a result, 47 people die. The governor, as a true patriot, cannot fight against his people. And having become, willingly or unwillingly, the culprit of the death of people, he awaits inevitable retribution for this.","popularity":0.1576,"poster_path":"/uGGU1PPHedpjmwTevfd97izZBfI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11436,"logo_path":"/oP91a5RrDqF0vYDT09pNKc9dKkf.png","name":"Sverdlovsk Film Studio","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1991-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Governor","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","title":"Gubernator","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":550525,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boris Khimichev","original_name":"Борис Химичев","popularity":0.2703,"profile_path":"/3W4jf3euln4LDUatehqvi8jX2zK.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"66846910fa1370cb0ebadd2f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110035,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ivan Krasko","original_name":"Иван Краско","popularity":0.1647,"profile_path":"/rBvMXGQxw1IufEgy3vbtnXI6Dkt.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"66846936fbea081ce377522c","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":237491,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergei Varchuk","original_name":"Сергей Варчук","popularity":0.1372,"profile_path":"/yRQBVQ8PQ6tHJXEuvaVxYiPYINk.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"668469504edaa2272217a095","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2340482,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexandr Volkhonsky","original_name":"Alexandr Volkhonsky","popularity":0.0571,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"66846960cec673f92c1e6c2d","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1491806,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Natalya Kovalyova","original_name":"Наталья Ковалёва","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/wNYUnSy5xc7bErs8Tpte2k6bjkF.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6684699825ca71c3c57751de","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1125337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vyacheslav Kirilichev","original_name":"Вячеслав Кириличев","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":"/zkVxTyqTezYU7iDhQOs2UX5OTPB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"668469eda7f58168c6aeb1d4","order":5}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1599153,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leonid Porokhnya","original_name":"Leonid Porokhnya","popularity":0.0535,"profile_path":"/2tDhOvznPO7ZKN3YLyhxH0zN2dw.jpg","credit_id":"66846a379c98b34f969b2add","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406486,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Nikolay Banko","original_name":"Николай Банько","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66846a5fb7c2846cfcaeb1d2","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1262049,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Aleksandr Pantykin","original_name":"Александр Пантыкин","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/vyIAucEWqpdqMXE8srAdRjkAXra.jpg","credit_id":"66846b94fb01a6d4fe17a25d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2603676,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Vladimir Makeranetc","original_name":"Vladimir Makeranetc","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/skA1BedfGZISepgK6wMt9kk5g3P.jpg","credit_id":"66846a22649b3941533afc9d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0382727","wikidata_id":"Q112657755","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/uGGU1PPHedpjmwTevfd97izZBfI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1992-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1991-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
