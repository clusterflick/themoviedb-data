The year is 1955 and 1979 all at once - a wondrous time when our childhood friends are decades away from knowing what a text message is or what a YouTube does. If you asked them about streaming, they'd guess it had something to do with a tube and the nearby creek. With the Texas wilderness as their home, they spend every waking hour outside thinking for themselves, exploring, solving their own problems, creating, and become the ones they will become. Sense of Wonder is a 3-part coming-of-age short film series.","popularity":0.3379,"poster_path":"/9sW8wMmP0KLK9GIjLxrvzWFq0JK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":232642,"logo_path":null,"name":"Primitive Planet Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sense of Wonder - One Small Step","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4804350,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Isaac Boren","original_name":"Isaac Boren","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Curtis","credit_id":"6682861c4f24e7e9821780f9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4804351,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sander Flammang","original_name":"Sander Flammang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Vernon","credit_id":"66828631a000e6275def6443","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4804352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robbie Rethaber","original_name":"Robbie Rethaber","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Russ","credit_id":"6682863c274d2c9ccc66e398","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4804348,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alec J.
