The Swiss conceptualist now dedicates his Spheres to the deconstruction of the artist’s ego. In a field not far from a housing development, a man prepares to throw a long, thin pole up into the air, thus embarking on a metaphorical journey to the depths of his being. This formally distinctive film examines details of the surroundings as its camera slowly and continuously pans 360°. The viewers, on the other hand, are invited to turn their attention inwards, to glimpse beneath the socially and culturally determined exterior of the human personality","popularity":0.0311,"poster_path":"/ynOV1bwecHfbpUY02XzpdEWpbDr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spheres","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2006565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Zimmerman","original_name":"Daniel Zimmerman","popularity":0.0532,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6683e27c79e4f897229b272f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt32827693","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":858,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ynOV1bwecHfbpUY02XzpdEWpbDr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":572}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Karlovy Vary International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-07-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
