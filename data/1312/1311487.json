The subject's responses to selected objects (a speaker, a fan, a lamp, and finally, a person) mimic the real-life neurological phenomenon of synaesthesia, the inextricable joining of normally separate perceptions ('hearing' colors, 'smelling' words, 'tasting' shapes, 'feeling' names). In particular, our protagonist is tested for a form of synaesthesia in which visually observed touch -to objects or to people- is felt viscerally on her own body. As the experiment progresses, the synaesthete begins to sense a presence behind the one-way mirror, imaginatively bridging the alienating strangeness of the situation. Sensorium Tests questions how sensations might be created and shared between people and objects.","popularity":0.0959,"poster_path":"/yj6WiNp1pXYb1El9YVm4cJaWvUE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sensorium Tests","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2598468,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valeria Napoleone","original_name":"Valeria Napoleone","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Scientist","credit_id":"66833e747c73f0d2b3261e61","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":20699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anamaria Marinca","original_name":"Anamaria Marinca","popularity":0.4763,"profile_path":"/9AMasU3BbXfncjXkmKOSxoqJaCf.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Test Subject","credit_id":"66833ebb72b7d040a99b0d1d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4805487,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Flo Brooks","original_name":"Flo Brooks","popularity":0.0434,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"66833ed46807bc7ea8c83659","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4805489,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Barker","original_name":"Mark Barker","popularity":0.0322,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"66833ee872b7d040a99b0d2d","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1638708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daria Martin","original_name":"Daria Martin","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/aDlGlWlEtP9jVnnZpWF8oC1SbyH.jpg","credit_id":"66833deb9e518db05b1b7b61","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1638708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daria Martin","original_name":"Daria Martin","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":"/aDlGlWlEtP9jVnnZpWF8oC1SbyH.jpg","credit_id":"66834380754926d4ed3adfc2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10282768","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/783ovGtgKiUyTgwh9iOSH3gxO1M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1498,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yj6WiNp1pXYb1El9YVm4cJaWvUE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":999}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
