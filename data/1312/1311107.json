Retired from the Negro Leagues, Blue Genes was the greatest pitcher of all time. More than anything, Sam wants a baby brother to share his passion for science and music. Sam finds an old vacuum tube in the trash and, with it, builds a mental concentrator which allows him to see into another dimension. Sam begins seeing a baby from outer space (heaven) which nobody else can see. Things get really interesting when Blue, who turns out to be an angel, claims he needs Sam's help to rebuild the Holy Grail and reestablish Earth's connection with heaven before evil Nurse Nancy and her fiendish crow destroy them all. Only with the help of Sophia and the electronics store clerk (played by Peter Wolf) can Sam learn to see with his heart and save the Earth from impending doom","popularity":0.1628,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Adventures of Space Baby and Mental Man","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4803855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Brown","original_name":"Charles Brown","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":17,"character":"Blue","credit_id":"66821a1ac001490b743ad56b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4803860,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sam Dean","original_name":"Sam Dean","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Sam / Mental Man","credit_id":"66821a6758a097365d65aaac","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4803861,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sophia Dean","original_name":"Sophia Dean","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Nature Girl","credit_id":"66821a7c6a8e55ec12c3db9c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4803863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Dean","original_name":"Will Dean","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Space Baby","credit_id":"66821a9370794d6375f1747a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4803865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"G.
