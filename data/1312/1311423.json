Today, Johnny Donnels’ photography is known all over the world. Johnny himself was an icon of the French Quarter, where he ran a gallery filled with his own art. Successfully unemployed right up until his death in 2009, he continued to produce a body of work that remains “vastly under-exploited.” Revealed in a lover’s embrace with the life he created, he was, to many, the last of the great Bohemians: a symbol of freedom and ease, who, by the sparseness of his demands, lived a life of luxury. Johnny crossed the intersection of art and commerce with humor and grace. This special film reveals the surprising discipline that underpins a life of freedom.","popularity":0.238,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pink Satin Suit","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4805155,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johnny Donnels","original_name":"Johnny Donnels","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"6683065dda22c91aea85af0a","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4805152,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anastasia Lyman","original_name":"Anastasia Lyman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"668306189e518db05b1b79e7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":163671,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Lyman","original_name":"Will Lyman","popularity":0.4598,"profile_path":"/ymifKdrtMFEZVYTvOmYoshPg7HR.jpg","credit_id":"66830626a24f026825268bc8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2359898,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Peter Krieger","original_name":"Peter Krieger","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6683063b7a5424e86b21f908","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4805154,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"David Torkanowsky","original_name":"David Torkanowsky","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6683064d7a5424e86b21f913","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2002-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
