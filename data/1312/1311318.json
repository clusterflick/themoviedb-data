In a comparison among four sports (skateboarding, surfing, skiing and hang gliding, the similarities of handling body movement are elaborated. A \"fall line\" is the straightest, fastest line downward - whether it be down wave, slope or air corridor. The comparative ways in which a body acts to slow the descent and adapt to the unexpected are shown on land, air and water. Makes us aware that these exhilarating sports have been made possible by new technologies, and illustrates that challenging experiences need not necessarily be competitive or affect the environment adversely. An excellent motivational film.  Champion surfer, Nat Young, compares body movements in four relatively new sports: skateboarding, surfing, skiing, and hang gliding.  They all use the fall-line...the shortest way from the top to the bottom.  16mm","popularity":0.1194,"poster_path":"/awZkuR9KmulmtmqI8hL4ko3Z2AT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20859,"logo_path":null,"name":"Churchill Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":232670,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nat Young Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fall Line","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","title":"Nat Young's Fall Line","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nat Young","original_name":"Nat Young","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/Ae3a48TlvhHj5DQbVvOclMbgRaT.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"(Self)","credit_id":"6682cc19583d92db5d21f784","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4804803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Wieman","original_name":"Kate Wieman","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"(Self)","credit_id":"6682cc4ecd45150bc649cdf4","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nat Young","original_name":"Nat Young","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/Ae3a48TlvhHj5DQbVvOclMbgRaT.jpg","credit_id":"6682cc76835232f20149cdc6","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":240476,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nat Young","original_name":"Nat Young","popularity":0.0377,"profile_path":"/Ae3a48TlvhHj5DQbVvOclMbgRaT.jpg","credit_id":"6682cc6b491873c404166060","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1161416","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/awZkuR9KmulmtmqI8hL4ko3Z2AT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"16mm","release_date":"1977-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"16mm","release_date":"1979-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
