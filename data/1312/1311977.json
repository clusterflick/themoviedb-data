Now almost a century later, Nat has managed to orchestrate the reunification of the family's land. He recruits his Great Nephew Vallon and his friend Byron to help him piece together the remains of his Father's fledgling black community, burned down during the racial animus of the Post Reconstruction South. Vallon, after being warned by his Great Uncle Dirty Nat, to pay his proper respects at a centuries old Hanging Tree before entering a mysterious marsh, finds himself on the wrong side of history. In brushing it off as superstition he is seen as a trespasser and incurs the wrath of a restless spirit known as the DUPPY MAN.","popularity":0.0357,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":232813,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ratio Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":232814,"logo_path":null,"name":"John Crow Creative","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Past Doesn't Die.
