Maria Lang was a powerful and outgoing celebrity in Sweden who, from her debut in 1949 with \"Mördaren ljuger inte ensam\" published a book a year until 1990. Her real name was Dagmar Lange and she was an eccentric teacher and director of studies in Stockholm. Over time, Lang came to see how the detective genre was evolving and the readership was shrinking. This is the story of one of Sweden's most important detective writers who ended his days in a small apartment in the town of Nora where he grew up.","popularity":0.0297,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maria Lang: Sveriges första deckardrottning","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cRKPKOQqs6zdDWShjlmouoyy5xs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
