Amit lives with his younger brother, Raju (Randhir Kapoor), and Raju already calls Suman \"Bhabhi\". Amit teaches in college, but Raju is unemployed and a little bit spoiled by Amit and Suman's pamperings. Raju gets into bad company, and as a result in trouble. When Amit comes to help Raju, he gets killed. Suman dons the garb of a widow and does not play to marry again. Then one day a look-alike of Amit, named Shankar enters Suman and Raju's life. Guilt-ridden Raju thinks that he has gotten his brother back, and tries to make amends by hiring Shankar, not knowing that Shankar is a wanted criminal, and is looking for an escape route from the authorities.","popularity":0.5927,"poster_path":"/jckUkeAA0vkPbFXizHAz0MTBXZE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1978-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":147,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kasme Vaade","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35780,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amitabh Bachchan","original_name":"Amitabh Bachchan","popularity":1.2497,"profile_path":"/u69PvpWqGkywSm0YjFiw77j9eqS.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Amit / Shankar","credit_id":"586732899251413e49004a7a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":142627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Randhir Kapoor","original_name":"Randhir Kapoor","popularity":0.2741,"profile_path":"/92PWRkXqGP6hkIY5eeOnaS1WAcm.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Raju","credit_id":"586732939251413e41004d25","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":88812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Neetu Singh","original_name":"Neetu Singh","popularity":0.4103,"profile_path":"/sErXXqb3YkKCYAvlFv7FrZHHxhg.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Neeta","credit_id":"5867329ac3a368110900472a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":86061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rakhee Gulzar","original_name":"Rakhee Gulzar","popularity":0.4862,"profile_path":"/xJ7D1qDTFfZzDNP6yoRRkqsN0UX.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Suman","credit_id":"5b429b9b9251414f48012473","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amjad Khan","original_name":"Amjad Khan","popularity":0.6131,"profile_path":"/52s7Cbukn505Bo0JzLdurF8RXb.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Juda, the Hunchback (Guest Appearance)","credit_id":"60ac7ed4d7fbda00407e9860","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57789,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vijayendra Ghatge","original_name":"Vijayendra Ghatge","popularity":0.2236,"profile_path":"/rky0uGC152TbPhoop3XaSIUj6RW.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Kundan Ghanshyamdas","credit_id":"60ac7ee7d18b24003f7583f0","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1943583,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Master Bhagwan","original_name":"Master Bhagwan","popularity":0.0861,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Street Singer","credit_id":"60ac7ef46331b20029d4a333","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1730691,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tabassum","original_name":"Tabassum","popularity":0.1187,"profile_path":"/8alVDC8F9BJG9BmgvNT2aThcDmo.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Announcer at Art Exhibition (Guest Appearance) (uncredited)","credit_id":"60ac7f1bad87f7002917f130","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":109621,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rekha","original_name":"Rekha","popularity":0.9491,"profile_path":"/fTXd5QlWck5CDxijM56YXx2Crob.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Dancer (Guest Appearance)","credit_id":"60ac7f2677b1fb007873793d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharat Saxena","original_name":"Sharat Saxena","popularity":0.519,"profile_path":"/ArW6nQ23bjVfbcFmNVl4W9zpd7X.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"","credit_id":"62ebde85ea84c700613abe99","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110103,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"M.
