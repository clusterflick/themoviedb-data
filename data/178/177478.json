During his sixty-year-plus career, Eisner introduced the now-traditional mode of comic book production; championed mature, sophisticated storytelling; was an early advocate for using the medium as a tool for education; pioneered the now-popular graphic novel, and served as inspiration for generations of artists. Without a doubt, Will Eisner was the godfather of the American comic book.","popularity":1.0745,"poster_path":"/zRLXFgZ5GwMflKCApCcLsNI3B5x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Will Eisner: Portrait of a Sequential Artist","video":false,"vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83875,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Will Eisner","original_name":"Will Eisner","popularity":0.0962,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"59a83b8fc3a3683cf8017d50","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1836915,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Art Spiegelman","original_name":"Art Spiegelman","popularity":0.1214,"profile_path":"/abGYLA0EunQ3xVvDMXJS2gphT58.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"59a83b96c3a3683cf8017d5d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2293,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Frank Miller","original_name":"Frank Miller","popularity":0.6016,"profile_path":"/2eqqLG9Sv4i1ZlM14wY2LTTEbld.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"59a83ba092514157ee017a27","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1356195,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jerry Robinson","original_name":"Jerry Robinson","popularity":0.6283,"profile_path":"/606OVQrzUFksbBERMiNxsm8MQtL.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"59a83ba99251415808018b1b","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69051,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jules Feiffer","original_name":"Jules Feiffer","popularity":0.2283,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"59a83bb3925141579d0184f6","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":72426,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kurt Vonnegut","original_name":"Kurt Vonnegut","popularity":0.1785,"profile_path":"/yEttml8qBkDC6FsdYtfkXkWB54V.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"59a83bbfc3a3683ccc0194e3","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":35019,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Max Allan Collins","original_name":"Max Allan Collins","popularity":0.1023,"profile_path":"/9vywTORGR6pNNyayvSKhzxSXotR.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"59a83bd09251415808018b62","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67758,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Chabon","original_name":"Michael Chabon","popularity":0.356,"profile_path":"/aEzyx6UehZn4tW5IJMrdKgF2z0R.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"59a83bdcc3a3683c7a01abf7","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23446,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Neil Gaiman","original_name":"Neil Gaiman","popularity":0.9074,"profile_path":"/wXPREg2zhD9gsycde7AoMebVyfA.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"59a83be5c3a3683c870183f1","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7624,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Stan Lee","original_name":"Stan Lee","popularity":2.1613,"profile_path":"/kKeyWoFtTqOPsbmwylNHmuB3En9.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"","credit_id":"59a83bee92514157a50184ed","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1159967,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jon D.
