Ritchie s wife Evie (Barbara Kellerman), tired of the constant upheaval in her marriage, uses the opportunity to walk out, leaving him to care for their children.  Ritchie goes in search of Evie with the help of his manager s assistant Alicia (Judi Trott), however, an attraction grows between the pair and as they widen their pursuit, it becomes apparent that Evie is not ready to return home. Featuring original music from satirical post-punk musician B.A Robertson and early screen appearances from Peter Capaldi (Local Hero) and John Gordon Sinclair (Gregory s Girl), Gormley s bittersweet take on relationships is a fresh and captivating insight into how our actions affect the people we love.","popularity":1.1201,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living Apart Together","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1159651,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"B.
