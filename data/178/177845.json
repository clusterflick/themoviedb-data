A certain Matt Gardner wants to corner the freight business to Pecos and persuades young Zack Sibley's wagon master to switch sides. Zack also earns the enmity of Gardner's son Coe, who takes umbrage to the youngster's flirtation with pretty Helen Lee. It all comes to a head during a food shortage in Pecos, a near-disaster that persuades the wagon master to switch sides once again. When the dust settles, Zack learns that old man Gardner is actually Carl Anderson, the man who murdered his father.","popularity":1.3089,"poster_path":"/gSiOX0gHHhfhWeNVmHm7y2TDjBR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1940-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A New MAN of ACTION Rides the Range!","title":"Wagon Train","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":5,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14517,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Holt","original_name":"Tim Holt","popularity":0.2867,"profile_path":"/n8QRZsiwJetjSztTy0g7oqViWE7.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Zack Sibley","credit_id":"52fe4d8cc3a36847f8266d47","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":30260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Martha O'Driscoll","original_name":"Martha O'Driscoll","popularity":0.1305,"profile_path":"/9qpbAIKWrQVDPAQm2V4UEX7yaae.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Helen Lee","credit_id":"52fe4d8cc3a36847f8266d4b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":121056,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ray Whitley","original_name":"Ray Whitley","popularity":0.0416,"profile_path":"/odYCTgoZZPT4cVV23Q5oANyGxkC.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Ned","credit_id":"52fe4d8cc3a36847f8266d4f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emmett Lynn","original_name":"Emmett Lynn","popularity":0.3165,"profile_path":"/6UhukBWmiBfx3UrY02zALglZowM.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Whopper","credit_id":"52fe4d8cc3a36847f8266d53","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":30112,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenn Strange","original_name":"Glenn Strange","popularity":0.5104,"profile_path":"/6SPVOqbKTSt3NA6OzoXJsjJTucc.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Stagecoach driver","credit_id":"52fe4d8cc3a36847f8266d57","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1083422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malcolm 'Bud' McTaggart","original_name":"Malcolm 'Bud' McTaggart","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/uzSAkFsdGhKLFVuWiFSjH1SO1fV.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Coe Gardner","credit_id":"5742a50b9251414788000f47","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":89728,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cliff Clark","original_name":"Cliff Clark","popularity":0.2043,"profile_path":"/fB5QVw9oSYNZjMam84ubfNLCQHG.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Matt Gardner","credit_id":"5742a51cc3a368175f001579","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":134819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ellen Lowe","original_name":"Ellen Lowe","popularity":0.0714,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Amanthy","credit_id":"5742a5409251414788000f4f","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wade Crosby","original_name":"Wade Crosby","popularity":0.0517,"profile_path":"/tBnEQkUIzmQhLKkdnsgVDpqwHTu.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"O'Follard","credit_id":"5742a54ec3a368175f001580","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1041747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ethan Laidlaw","original_name":"Ethan Laidlaw","popularity":0.1508,"profile_path":"/dFwm3fnaUkEUzRbSUxSVmnnteX9.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Henchman Pat Hays","credit_id":"5742a55ec3a368175f001583","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589218,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monte Montague","original_name":"Monte Montague","popularity":0.1075,"profile_path":"/nKNAWODmTp7rw9kSo2m9ukj3Qyd.jpg","cast_id":12,"character":"Henchman Kurt","credit_id":"5742a56c9251414f52000da4","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carl Stockdale","original_name":"Carl Stockdale","popularity":0.1028,"profile_path":"/y642LERKLtOlqTjcckH8oWDVBGb.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Luke Wilkes","credit_id":"5742a580925141541f000d12","order":11},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1091322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Dane","original_name":"Bruce Dane","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":14,"character":"McKenzie","credit_id":"5742a590c3a3681805001510","order":12},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1210673,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Baldra","original_name":"Chuck Baldra","popularity":0.042,"profile_path":"/uUIYLxPM5xN0qhTgROZfs5KYI9c.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Wagon Train Cook and Musician","credit_id":"5742a5aa9251411dc80012a4","order":13},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":131047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ed Brady","original_name":"Ed Brady","popularity":0.147,"profile_path":"/vVep5r5nxvuex9RrYXJ8THR5uuM.jpg","cast_id":16,"character":"Sam -
