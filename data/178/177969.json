Shot in the Libyan desert and in an abandoned building in Lausitz, Germany, it features a man (Christian Schmidt), a woman (Giuliana Pachner, from Bellavista) - and, glimpsed now and again, a guide (Awad Elkish.) They talk, they fall silent. Winds blow. The sun shines. The camera runs. What gradually takes shape is nothing less than a painstakingly concentrated attempt to understand the human condition through the lens of cinema. A lofty ambition, and one that demands a considerable leap of faith on the part of the audience: this film is sedate, \"difficult\", challenging, often apparently impenetrable. But anyone who has seen Schreiner's previous films will be aware that he is by any standards a major artist, one that can be trusted to find places that other directors may not even suspect exist.","popularity":0.1486,"poster_path":"/u8US6zddB2DVhuhE977ONEcn3Qi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32684,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Schreiner Filmproduktion (echt.zeit.film)","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2013-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fata Morgana","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Giuliana Pachner","original_name":"Giuliana Pachner","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d8ec3a36847f82674cf","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1160357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christian Schmidt","original_name":"Christian Schmidt","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d8ec3a36847f82674cb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1160359,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Awad Elkish","original_name":"Awad Elkish","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4d8ec3a36847f82674d3","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":192410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Schreiner","original_name":"Peter Schreiner","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4d8ec3a36847f82674c7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":192410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Schreiner","original_name":"Peter Schreiner","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540fcc4f0e0a261255000eb9","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":192410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Schreiner","original_name":"Peter Schreiner","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540fcc550e0a261267000eba","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":192410,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter Schreiner","original_name":"Peter Schreiner","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540fcc660e0a261255000ebc","department":"Writing","job":"Idea"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362624,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Johannes Schmelzer-Ziringer","original_name":"Johannes Schmelzer-Ziringer","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540fcc850e0a261259000eee","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1362625,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Leo Schreiner","original_name":"Leo Schreiner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"540fcca80e0a261267000ec1","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1362624,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Johannes Schmelzer-Ziringer","original_name":"Johannes Schmelzer-Ziringer","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d976d634813826e69dabcd0","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt5502008","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/u8US6zddB2DVhuhE977ONEcn3Qi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":170487,"name":"essay film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Fata Morgana - trailer","key":"zhi1GcmD9Ws","published_at":"2013-01-21T10:24:27.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec706c3a368544800a3c8"}]}}}
