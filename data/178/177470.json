Invited to Dublin to present the premiere of a new choral work, The Messiah, he can't find singers adequate for the job. A boy who steals a chicken runs into Mr. Handel. The boy's Mother was NOT an employee at the Cathedral, she cleaned and ironed shirts, so the mother \"bribes\" Mr. Handel with non-starched shirts to save her boy from being in jail. The choir sucks until the washer lady's son is discovered by Handel.","popularity":0.2875,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Handel's Last Chance","video":false,"vote_average":3.333,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":166447,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Milan Cheylov","original_name":"Milan Cheylov","popularity":0.3232,"profile_path":"/bEw8P5gniVmpt1RgUHbZxfgzrKK.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d87c3a36847f8265b6d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0175701","wikidata_id":"Q5647357","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":5565,"name":"biography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
