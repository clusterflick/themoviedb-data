An object of contempt by her husband, her son and at her former workplace, Denise desperately clings to them, unable to communicate. This changes when Denise meets her new neighbors who initiate her to the world of poker. Little by little, she submits to the pleasures of the game and substitutes one family for another.","popularity":0.2599,"poster_path":"/1mS355wUlODE0ygELI8rtFYnHjs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2012-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Mise à l'aveugle","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":227602,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Micheline Bernard","original_name":"Micheline Bernard","popularity":0.1587,"profile_path":"/xx4WVMWCb1Bk169NoYpQMezw3eS.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Denise","credit_id":"52fe4d7dc3a36847f8263d85","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Sincennes","original_name":"Louis Sincennes","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Paul","credit_id":"52fe4d7dc3a36847f8263d89","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159393,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Fournier","original_name":"Marc Fournier","popularity":0.2076,"profile_path":"/rASuOLvLJSWRPj3tVKeNxwHu9pX.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Éric","credit_id":"52fe4d7dc3a36847f8263d8d","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1159394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christine Beaulieu","original_name":"Christine Beaulieu","popularity":0.3014,"profile_path":"/bteGXASgFkfkRRd5aT1JneTEgs1.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Julie","credit_id":"52fe4d7dc3a36847f8263d91","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":545079,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julien Poulin","original_name":"Julien Poulin","popularity":0.3171,"profile_path":"/6UXNTlS1ooKRutQef6jzrGvoo2d.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Michel","credit_id":"52fe4d7dc3a36847f8263d95","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81822,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pierre-Luc Brillant","original_name":"Pierre-Luc Brillant","popularity":0.1953,"profile_path":"/AwmQxobIL4A17XiQG7OXN2CNcwm.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Alex","credit_id":"52fe4d7dc3a36847f8263d99","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1323858,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valérie Roy","original_name":"Valérie Roy","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":"/5tm1m9pL0oIKxXdCbQ1aVqxmfyN.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Receptionist","credit_id":"5d467d732d1e40219bc01465","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Galiero","original_name":"Simon Galiero","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/ornUCMgn8QXTCAYkHsUuwfeZVDV.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d7dc3a36847f8263d75","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Galiero","original_name":"Simon Galiero","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/ornUCMgn8QXTCAYkHsUuwfeZVDV.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d7dc3a36847f8263d7b","department":"Writing","job":"Story"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1159391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simon Galiero","original_name":"Simon Galiero","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/ornUCMgn8QXTCAYkHsUuwfeZVDV.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4d7dc3a36847f8263d81","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2274346","wikidata_id":"Q30738482","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1mS355wUlODE0ygELI8rtFYnHjs.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2012-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
