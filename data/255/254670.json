One buys a small harmonica and learns to play it; he keeps his neighbor awake. The neighbor buys a larger harmonica, and an arms race ensues; the instruments get larger, until it's a piano vs. a pipe organ, and then they start bringing in larger groups of friends until an entire orchestra is playing the 1812 Overture. The houses collapse from all this, atop the dueling orchestras, and on their way up to heaven, the man puts his small harmonica up for sale.","popularity":0.416,"poster_path":"/eqMMYWZc0crjAY4SYs6jn1IHzLF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5724,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zagreb Film","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1959-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Musical Cold War","title":"Piccolo","video":false,"vote_average":6.273,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dušan Vukotić","original_name":"Dušan Vukotić","popularity":0.128,"profile_path":"/ci2TFK7e4m80Oaszfjks13rItIo.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4eca9251416c9113de8f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1088228,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dušan Vukotić","original_name":"Dušan Vukotić","popularity":0.128,"profile_path":"/ci2TFK7e4m80Oaszfjks13rItIo.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4eca9251416c9113de95","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359666,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tea Brunšmid","original_name":"Tea Brunšmid","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"572a230992514109f10000c9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1359667,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Mladen Prebil","original_name":"Mladen Prebil","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"572a2343c3a36827990000ec","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1359666,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Tea Brunšmid","original_name":"Tea Brunšmid","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"572a237292514109f10000d5","department":"Sound","job":"Music Supervisor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0147171","wikidata_id":"Q21869721","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eqMMYWZc0crjAY4SYs6jn1IHzLF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2872,"name":"window"},{"id":3352,"name":"tree"},{"id":1670,"name":"sun"},{"id":2089,"name":"harmonica"},{"id":3501,"name":"bed"},{"id":6031,"name":"music instrument"},{"id":3537,"name":"orchestra"},{"id":4572,"name":"organ"},{"id":6674,"name":"chair"},{"id":154900,"name":"noisy neighbor"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1959-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Piccolo (1959)","key":"Y9u4AG52yz8","published_at":"2011-06-16T03:51:32.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"57294674c3a3680902000456"}]}}}
