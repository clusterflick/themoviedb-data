The obstruction of understandable language allowed for the actors and the director to improvise when shooting the scenes. As spoken language and text became more and more abstracted through the filming process, the actors physical expression became the predominant form of communication. Under these working premisses, the act of filmmaking allows to experience an “state of exception” comparable to a moment of social anarchy. Ultimately “Amsterdam” perhaps can be considered a love story gone strange.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ámsterdam","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290778,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philippe Eustachon","original_name":"Philippe Eustachon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4eb89251416c9113b56d","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290779,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elsa-Louise Manceaux","original_name":"Elsa-Louise Manceaux","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4eb89251416c9113b571","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290776,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Carlos Amorales","original_name":"Carlos Amorales","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eb89251416c9113b563","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290777,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Reinaldo Laddaga","original_name":"Reinaldo Laddaga","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eb89251416c9113b569","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
