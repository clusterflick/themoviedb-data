Santos discusses his views on the importance of respecting difference and his belief that an alternative globalisation model could wholly enfranchise all citizens of the world. An illustrious presence in 20th century social sciences, the man dubbed as ‘geography’s philosopher’ eloquently elucidates a developing world perspective on the global age.","popularity":0.8708,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2007-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Meeting with Milton Santos","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1364398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milton Santos","original_name":"Milton Santos","popularity":0.0336,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"5417f6bd0e0a26380100225e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54566,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"José Saramago","original_name":"José Saramago","popularity":0.0915,"profile_path":"/8dasmjnUVBk5xywcZspbk8FiStP.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"5417f6ce0e0a2637e7001eb1","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10055,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fernanda Montenegro","original_name":"Fernanda Montenegro","popularity":0.7519,"profile_path":"/bja0rn1BjAnA5Z5VbEvL2apvMT5.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Narradora","credit_id":"575538b3c3a3686a28000c1b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1176187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Beth Goulart","original_name":"Beth Goulart","popularity":0.1386,"profile_path":"/2U1LLsSkXTZAsfcNIUR0lfTUHvv.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Narradora","credit_id":"575538a2c3a368680300497a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1002783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Osmar Prado","original_name":"Osmar Prado","popularity":0.2711,"profile_path":"/jU3NP6KLHu0G6EthWNGhcxEJb1t.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Narrador","credit_id":"575538bfc3a3685fc400217b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matheus Nachtergaele","original_name":"Matheus Nachtergaele","popularity":0.3836,"profile_path":"/zgTT5AP7NYa2hN0jUqHIHkNyp2v.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Narrador","credit_id":"575538ca9251412dff000c3e","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Milton Gonçalves","original_name":"Milton Gonçalves","popularity":0.4912,"profile_path":"/4ikyHa36jV22phvbhgS8YfTjLAt.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Narrador","credit_id":"575538e0c3a368091a002a79","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1364397,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eduardo Galeano","original_name":"Eduardo Galeano","popularity":0.0856,"profile_path":"/7RWfjJyinIaUMoATdSONuSX1E8x.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"","credit_id":"5417f6aec3a36819ae00229b","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1474620,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zélia Duncan","original_name":"Zélia Duncan","popularity":0.1309,"profile_path":"/jH7CVyWsWyHFZmkyaduOjKp9tK2.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"575538e9c3a3683c90001306","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197657,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adirley Queirós","original_name":"Adirley Queirós","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/pGPelesROSpJZ9qySKWJrLdZGYD.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5510bf53c3a3681db200cc84","order":9}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1138622,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Silvio Tendler","original_name":"Silvio Tendler","popularity":0.0595,"profile_path":"/wDhgT6rFtzmzLvmFHqFjPeY9iZd.jpg","credit_id":"5417f6dfc3a36819b40021b2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3648008","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6078,"name":"politics"},{"id":593,"name":"globalization"},{"id":192940,"name":"geography"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
