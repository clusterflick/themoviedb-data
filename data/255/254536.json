His host Hofrat Lassnig-Schiele may have a hand in it. Charming and funny 'Vienna' episode of the successful crime series! Crime author Leo Leitner is surprisingly awarded the Leo Perutz Prize in Vienna. He reluctantly follows his publisher to the Austrian capital, where he is welcomed by the Viennese society. A tragic incident occurs during the awards ceremony. Burgtheater actor Staberny is found dead in the toilet, presumably suicide. Leo's criminal instinct is awakened.
