This is a High School specifically tailored for pregnant teenagers &amp; teenage moms. School buses come equipped with baby seats, there's onsite daycare &amp; health clinic, parenting classes are on the curriculum -- and the lockers are pink. With teen pregnancy rates on the rise, and the consequences often devastating, TAPP is designed to give these teens - who otherwise would most likely dropout - a chance to stay on course and graduate despite the fact they're becoming moms at such a young age.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baby High","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
