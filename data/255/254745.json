It was attended by 120,000 people. The concert consisted of two parts, the Main Concert and a Sunrise Concert. The concert cost approximately $9,500,000 and it originated when Jean-Michel Jarre was contacted by the Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak with a special project to celebrate the dawn of the new Millennium at the foot of the only remaining monument of the original 7 Wonders of the World - the Great Pyramids.  Jarre's team had developed giant projections to be displayed on the faces of the Great Pyramids, however a heavy cloud of fog made the pyramids almost invisible, so most of the projections were discarded. Parts of the concert were broadcast live on TV stations around the world.","popularity":0.0709,"poster_path":"/ozGh6KukvoKFWtLpRMWf5isrnvy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jean Michel Jarre at the Pyramids","video":true,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":229715,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Michel Jarre","original_name":"Jean-Michel Jarre","popularity":0.2252,"profile_path":"/igMC6lIKkdlebQ2nXfiWZW76CDI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Musician","credit_id":"67a9d1e60bf46f8e880f7ea6","order":0}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.777,"height":1024,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oeG4QYWGVIeI3q9sBpsrh6hXY65.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1820},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3FNcE0Qv4kzsIep65KFbp2oq4v6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ozGh6KukvoKFWtLpRMWf5isrnvy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"U","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2001-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"1999-12-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
