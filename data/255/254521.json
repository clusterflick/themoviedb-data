The opening sections of the film focus upon those who have tried and failed to establish a lasting power in the capital. ‘At Delhi’, the commentator states, ‘successive cities have been built by conquering invaders – each has fallen into disuse and decay’. The camerawork focuses on the ‘impressive ruins’ of these earlier invaders. Although the film also depicts the enduring architecture of Muslim rulers, such as Akbar and Shahjahan, it is stressed that their power has been superseded. Legend has it that it will be the ninth city of Delhi that ‘will endure and will rule forever’. Shahjahan had built the eighth.","popularity":0.3638,"poster_path":"/upkXUHE4CvfzTA7wUzTdM0dxaw0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30156,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Window","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1938-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Delhi","video":false,"vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290086,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hans Nieter","original_name":"Hans Nieter","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ec19251416c9113c907","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":6603,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jack Cardiff","original_name":"Jack Cardiff","popularity":0.2141,"profile_path":"/eBO70vjLsISADqr1xgSK7MucN39.jpg","credit_id":"5eac4b44e32943001cb4aea8","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1353590,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"E.S.
