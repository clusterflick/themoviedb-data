Donning the guise of \"Leatherface,\" a swashbuckling masked avenger, Van Ryke performs his derring-do on behalf of the Prince of Orange (Nigel de Brulier). Naturally, Van Ruke considers beautiful Spanish aristocrat Donna Leonora de Vargas (Vilma Banky) to be a bitter enemy, and the feeling is mutual. To no one's surprise, however, Van Ryke and Donna Leonara eventually fall in love (hence the title). The pulse-pounding climax finds Van Ryke riding hell-for-leather through a rainstorm to warn the Flemish troops about the Spaniards' plans to burn the city of Ghent to the ground. Two Lovers was based on Madame Orczy's novel Leatherface, and adapted for the screen by Alice Duer Miller.","popularity":0.3646,"poster_path":"/xqC2MnFpqOLzRryzWs4mACyzq21.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28205,"logo_path":"/70VLg1uTo7gXdJQczgl1DPmp3hT.png","name":"Samuel Goldwyn Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every Emotion Thrillingly Yours in This Their Final Picture Together!","title":"Two Lovers","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29522,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ronald Colman","original_name":"Ronald Colman","popularity":0.4218,"profile_path":"/2Rw0UG4QLk8cDCTGZZ5RxFK1e41.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Mark van Rycke","credit_id":"52fe4ed69251416c9113f7c3","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":932465,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vilma Banky","original_name":"Vilma Banky","popularity":0.0616,"profile_path":"/runsDppoL2p3wcVRE56flRP8MmV.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Donna Leonora de Vargas","credit_id":"52fe4ed69251416c9113f7c7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128324,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noah Beery","original_name":"Noah Beery","popularity":0.1441,"profile_path":"/7VGAfjnR7FkuDk33bzTGZ4rnKg.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"The Duke of Azar","credit_id":"52fe4ed69251416c9113f7cb","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nigel De Brulier","original_name":"Nigel De Brulier","popularity":0.1272,"profile_path":"/zuV7Kj0bBPg0BYjjyq0rm0PhaW5.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"The Prince of Orange","credit_id":"52fe4ed69251416c9113f7cf","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1086579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Virginia Bradford","original_name":"Virginia Bradford","popularity":0.0802,"profile_path":"/wjX358Ck4GIL9jKI61H19bT4CtF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Grete","credit_id":"52fe4ed69251416c9113f7d3","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2092,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Lukas","original_name":"Paul Lukas","popularity":0.271,"profile_path":"/uPN8hpMtacoFylb0Ez9j800bilZ.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Don Ramon de Linea","credit_id":"52fe4ed69251416c9113f7d7","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1282327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Esmelton","original_name":"Fred Esmelton","popularity":0.0712,"profile_path":"/fnY72WRpdMgU7oqniDNLC3oKZ2l.jpg","cast_id":15,"character":"Meinherr Van Rycke, the Bailiff of Ghent","credit_id":"541eaeea0e0a26124600b21d","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1182938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lydia Yeamans Titus","original_name":"Lydia Yeamans Titus","popularity":0.0745,"profile_path":"/87nS94kb8JJvIBDBZYpFn0ELfo6.jpg","cast_id":17,"character":"Innkeeper's Wife","credit_id":"5ebc874c3d3557001edacc36","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":364526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scotty Mattraw","original_name":"Scotty Mattraw","popularity":0.1611,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":18,"character":"Dandermonde Innkeeper","credit_id":"5ebc87554c259200202a4c81","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1351812,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marcella Daly","original_name":"Marcella Daly","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":19,"character":"Marda","credit_id":"5ebc87608e2e00002110353c","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1090669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harry Allen","original_name":"Harry Allen","popularity":0.1062,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":20,"character":"Jean","credit_id":"5ebc877b8e2e00002110357a","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":108106,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Niblo","original_name":"Fred Niblo","popularity":0.1305,"profile_path":"/gtIMwkKyd4vQ7BmzojCl99HVXPs.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ed69251416c9113f7bf","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":134418,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Baroness Emmuska Orczy","original_name":"Baroness Emmuska Orczy","popularity":0.0456,"profile_path":"/1g9rrTknZmmjf0809bS5PaDRIQw.jpg","credit_id":"541eabfc0e0a260e9800a4b7","department":"Writing","job":"Novel"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1080345,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alice D.G.
