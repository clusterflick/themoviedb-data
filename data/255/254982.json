Now plaintive, now crass, now searching, now pleading, the line takes on a haunting quality not quite undercut by the tune’s tongue-in-cheek twang. The work introduced a recurring motif in the artist’s repertoire: the slick-haired singer, a persona Kjartansson has honed in real life as front man for the synth-heavy Reykjavík rock band Trabant, now on hiatus. The band’s performances — as seen on YouTube, anyway — have been blowout affairs, full of rock ’n’ roll swagger and screaming teenage fans. Mercy was a first step toward connecting this sassy streak with the artist’s maturing explorations of Icelandic identity.","popularity":0.0503,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mercy","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ragnar Kjartansson","original_name":"Ragnar Kjartansson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Ragnar","credit_id":"52fe4eda9251416c9113ff87","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1291790,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ragnar Kjartansson","original_name":"Ragnar Kjartansson","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eda9251416c9113ff83","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-02-10T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
