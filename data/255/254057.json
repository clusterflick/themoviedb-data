He does not have time. He does not have time for his little daughter Elina and he does not have time for Petra who actually just wanted to make an interview with his room-mate Willy. Mueller is busy, always busy in every kind of situation. All his problems seemed to be solved when he realizes that Willy has invented a time-machine. Everything could be fine now, if just Mueller had listened better to Willy's warnings about the rules of time travelling.","popularity":0.304,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":13983,"logo_path":"/wTYO3w8PawspS95VYwsHcajmI0t.png","name":"Südwestfunk","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1993-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magic Müller","video":false,"vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":34297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ingo Naujoks","original_name":"Ingo Naujoks","popularity":0.2281,"profile_path":"/cAfUfcSs7hM3ftcl6MgITxAkZdo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Müller","credit_id":"52fe4ea29251416c9113877b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22686,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Maria Schrader","original_name":"Maria Schrader","popularity":0.2389,"profile_path":"/sZuIcKq5D75GNKlYecK08O3X0hG.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Petra","credit_id":"52fe4ea29251416c9113877f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julia Böning","original_name":"Julia Böning","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Elina","credit_id":"52fe4ea29251416c91138783","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":74225,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jaymes Butler","original_name":"Jaymes Butler","popularity":0.3151,"profile_path":"/i22INNLIiq0h3W26UwdcLed1O4N.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Harri","credit_id":"52fe4ea29251416c91138787","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18449,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rupert Seidl","original_name":"Rupert Seidl","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/q08KjKBfJjwdliR4A9JOCf6hOnR.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Willy","credit_id":"52fe4ea29251416c9113878b","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1290039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Udo Weinberger","original_name":"Udo Weinberger","popularity":0.1107,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Janitor","credit_id":"52fe4ea29251416c9113878f","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Janna Marangosoff","original_name":"Janna Marangosoff","popularity":0.0519,"profile_path":"/l8ASTvlij7tyzmdRIVQ15ODgLcs.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Micky","credit_id":"52fe4ea29251416c91138793","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290043,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Theo Maalek","original_name":"Theo Maalek","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Horst","credit_id":"52fe4ea29251416c91138797","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":22185,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadeshda Brennicke","original_name":"Nadeshda Brennicke","popularity":0.545,"profile_path":"/oS0nWd3MoR92qdanNoV3dwhb2XK.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Vera","credit_id":"52fe4ea29251416c9113879b","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1290046,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margarete Salbach","original_name":"Margarete Salbach","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Erna","credit_id":"52fe4ea29251416c9113879f","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heinz Rilling","original_name":"Heinz Rilling","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Porter","credit_id":"52fe4ea29251416c911387a3","order":10}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68854,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Philipp Weinges","original_name":"Philipp Weinges","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ea29251416c911387b5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36465,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Thomas Bohn","original_name":"Thomas Bohn","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ea29251416c911387a9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18094,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Günter Knarr","original_name":"Günter Knarr","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ea29251416c911387af","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0107483","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1993-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
