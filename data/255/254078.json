In a flashback, he tells the boy that many years ago this paradise was nearly wrecked when greed swept over the land, and this led to poverty and misery before all the farmers came to their senses. Sounds like a film that should have been investigated by the HUAC committee.","popularity":0.1067,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":42019,"logo_path":"/mFPTppw3q4tY9R2b7QxVv4zevLi.png","name":"Terrytoons","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aesop's Fable: Happy Valley","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":557251,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eddie Donnelly","original_name":"Eddie Donnelly","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ea39251416c911389c1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":161290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Morrison","original_name":"Tom Morrison","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ea39251416c911389c7","department":"Writing","job":"Story"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0161646","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1952-09-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
