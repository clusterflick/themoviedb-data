Contrary to the romanticized film version, the structures represent a period of terror, desperation, and death for over 16,000 POWs and 100,00 local slaves.  The Thailand - Burma Railway was the vision of the Japanese Imperial Army: a 250-mile track cut through dense jungle that would connect Bangkok and Rangoon. To accomplish this nearly impossible feat, the fanatical and ruthless Japanese engineers used POWs and local slaves as manpower.  Candid interviews with men who lived through the atrocity - including Dutch, Australian, British, and American POWs - illuminate the violence and horror of their three-and-a-half-year internment. From Britain's surrender of Singapore the enduring force of friendship, The True Story Of The Bridge On The River Kwai narrates a moving and unforgettable account of a period in history that must be remembered.","popularity":0.7308,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24027,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greystone Communications","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true story of what happened in World War 2 Thailand","title":"The True Story of the Bridge on the River Kwai","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Time Machine: The True Story of the Bridge on the River Kwai","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Time Machine with  Roger Mudd: The True Story of the Bridge on the River Kwai","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39188,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Edward Woodward","original_name":"Edward Woodward","popularity":0.5423,"profile_path":"/rCaRJ1iQeKlxW316Cq3u50u0njf.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Himself - Narrator","credit_id":"52fe4ea39251416c911389e9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1290064,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David DeVries","original_name":"David DeVries","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ea49251416c911389f5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1290064,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David DeVries","original_name":"David DeVries","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ea49251416c911389ef","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1290064,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"David DeVries","original_name":"David DeVries","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ea49251416c911389fb","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1238359,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Craig Haffner","original_name":"Craig Haffner","popularity":0.0613,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfc9365d1a8930019853807","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":162615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seth Isler","original_name":"Seth Isler","popularity":0.1899,"profile_path":"/lMpBz5BYpIGWeoO4IgHMW0fcbbK.jpg","credit_id":"5dfc93bd26dac100175d89b7","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":952686,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Charlie Maday","original_name":"Charlie Maday","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfc94ed26dac100125cef85","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2486660,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Bess Hubbard","original_name":"Bess Hubbard","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfc9484d236e6001689c5ac","department":"Production","job":"Researcher"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1894334,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Kevin Browne","original_name":"Kevin Browne","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfc93f265686e001390a271","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2486662,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Elyse Miranda","original_name":"Elyse Miranda","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfc94d765686e001390a4e0","department":"Production","job":"Supervising Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2486659,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Katherine Smith","original_name":"Katherine Smith","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5dfc943026dac100125cee6b","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28947,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Christopher L.
