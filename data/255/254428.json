Then, in a philosophy class, he almost succeeds in landing a date by lobbing an illustrated invitation at his love interest, Emma. All goes awry when a taller, more confident, bespectacled Columbia student cuts him off at the knees. So far, so very New York student film, but a conceit arrives to distinguish this story of Ivy League dating woes: the ghost of Friedrich Nietzsche appears before Nate to guide him towards self-actualization.","popularity":0.2031,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"short movie","title":"My Friend Friedrich","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290980,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathan Gorelick","original_name":"Nathan Gorelick","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4eba9251416c9113b9e7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290981,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Andrew Hasse","original_name":"Andrew Hasse","popularity":0.0563,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4eba9251416c9113b9ed","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":490,"name":"philosophy"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG-13","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
