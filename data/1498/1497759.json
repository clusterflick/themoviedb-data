This is the remarkable story of the origins of Scottish mountaineering and of Hugh Thomas Munro, the man whose name has become synonymous with Scotland's highest mountains. While modern-day athletes test themselves against these timeless mountain summits, Munro's enduring list of \"Mountains Exceeding 3,000 Feet in Height\" has evolved into a cultural cornerstone of modern-day Scotland, building a legacy that Munro himself could never have imagined.  Scottish mountaineering as we know it originated in the sciences, academia and the arts. But these hill-going pioneers came across a society in the Highland glens that had only just undergone immense upheaval with far-reaching consequences. Their journeys bridged societies, language, class and culture in pursuit of the very summits we still climb to this day.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/pCkzjdMEYZ0GJKZK7Ai5SEx7YxW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"3,000 Feet - The Highlander, the Early Mountaineers and Scotland’s Highest Mountains","title":"3,000 Feet","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5503599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Finlay Wild","original_name":"Finlay Wild","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"684cc3abf0993891e43fdfee","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5503603,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robin Campbell","original_name":"Robin Campbell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"684cc45bcee7bada933df4b7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5503604,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Irene Leckie","original_name":"Irene Leckie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"684cc4763a8b229c57bb479f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5503633,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamie Aarons","original_name":"Jamie Aarons","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"684cc88c1b74a9fa283df428","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5503635,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin Woods","original_name":"Kevin Woods","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Narrator/Himself","credit_id":"684cc8b3ef546c95c529472b","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5503579,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Wood","original_name":"Kevin Wood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684cc15fc6121b019f344183","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5503581,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lindsay Hill","original_name":"Lindsay Hill","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684cc178c01014b4791ebec9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5503605,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Kevin Wood","original_name":"Kevin Wood","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684cc492ad1b389921b0dc68","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pCkzjdMEYZ0GJKZK7Ai5SEx7YxW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1061}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":388,"name":"scotland"},{"id":353546,"name":"scottish munros"},{"id":353547,"name":"ben nevis"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
