M.J suffers with MADD (Mixed and Anxiety and Depressive Disorder) and  Combined ADHD. In the film, they use dramatisations and scenes where they talk directly to  their Dad in order to get him to understand what they go through on a daily basis, but to also  thank him for everything he’s done for always being there and supporting them  every step of the way.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/2o2B2s2TWjgJkuGbiZYDwXnx2X0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":239460,"logo_path":null,"name":"University of
