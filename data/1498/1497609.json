Described in the press as ‘meticulously crafted’ and ‘genuinely spellbinding’, his music came from a practice of non-directedness, directing us only to transcendence from our quotidian existence. This musical reverie celebrates the work Conor left behind when he died tragically of a heart attack aged 36, just when his music was beginning to flow out into the world. It pulses with the influences that went into the creation of his art – the windings of the river Moy, the human traffic of a small Mayo town, the migratory movements of swallows, a creaking 200-year-old hotel, the maternal melodies of his childhood.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":265229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Two Pair Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2025-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Conor Walsh: Selected Piano Works","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5503058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Conor Walsh","original_name":"Conor Walsh","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"684c6438e9ca8a7b3c3fde4f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2275533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keith Walsh","original_name":"Keith Walsh","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684c63ea8acfcc99453df36d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","release_dates":[{"certification":"12A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
