It all culminates in the next phase of Bogut's basketball journey, which will be his first stint on the sidelines, as an assistant coach with the Sydney Kings.  What's unique, though, is that it's a documentary driven by Longley. Bogut visits Longley's large but minimalist, reception-less sanctuary in Denmark, Western Australia -- about a five-hour drive south of Perth -- giving the audience the opportunity to see two of the country's most successful sporting exports in as stripped back an environment that exists in Australia.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":265228,"logo_path":null,"name":"Total Sports and Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":138735,"logo_path":null,"name":"Entropico","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Anything but tall stories.","title":"Lane Violation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4235315,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Bogut","original_name":"Andrew Bogut","popularity":0.1577,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"684c5f3ab68cba1afa1ebf2a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2617214,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luc Longley","original_name":"Luc Longley","popularity":0.3524,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"684c5f4cd374eef39f3fdcd7","order":1}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/tdOlnA5FRe53U0c0UhQ6JCejog4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":169055,"name":"national basketball association (nba)"},{"id":176752,"name":"basketball player"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"ESPN","release_date":"2025-06-11T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Luc Longley on Andrew Bogut: Lane Violation trailer","key":"eGXzThx1WEE","site":"YouTube","size":2160,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2025-06-05T07:51:20.000Z","id":"684c5f084ef4c4bee6294510"}]}}}
