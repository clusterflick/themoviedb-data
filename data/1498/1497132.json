Shot in the winter/spring of 2001 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the film was shown locally but then shelved until 2005, when it made its festival premiere at the 23rd Annual Minneapolis-St. Paul International Film Festival. It then went on to play at several esteemed festivals and movie nights in North America and beyond.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/dOlaelumIrjXwypeERuS6tlhyxC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self-Important Empirical Film #3, with Voice-over","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2110234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Andrae","original_name":"Dave Andrae","popularity":0.1785,"profile_path":"/9YCpzMc3lRsI517XQF3I8h5hKsr.jpg","credit_id":"684b29cc640159de782941aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2110234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Andrae","original_name":"Dave Andrae","popularity":0.1785,"profile_path":"/9YCpzMc3lRsI517XQF3I8h5hKsr.jpg","credit_id":"684b29daa5f6b5c9ab293f9c","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2110234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Andrae","original_name":"Dave Andrae","popularity":0.1785,"profile_path":"/9YCpzMc3lRsI517XQF3I8h5hKsr.jpg","credit_id":"684b29e9deaa74a7273dee2b","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2110234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Andrae","original_name":"Dave Andrae","popularity":0.1785,"profile_path":"/9YCpzMc3lRsI517XQF3I8h5hKsr.jpg","credit_id":"684b29f94490128c133fd9fb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2110234,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dave Andrae","original_name":"Dave Andrae","popularity":0.1785,"profile_path":"/9YCpzMc3lRsI517XQF3I8h5hKsr.jpg","credit_id":"684b2a10d7ae5f29071eb827","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0889659","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dOlaelumIrjXwypeERuS6tlhyxC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"This movie had its film festival premier at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Film Festival in April of 2005 but was first shown informally at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Junior Project Screening in May of 2001.","release_date":"2001-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Self-important Empirical Film #3, with Voice-over","key":"20325462","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-02-24T12:09:16.000Z","id":"684b2994933b5d32a13fdaff"}]}}}
