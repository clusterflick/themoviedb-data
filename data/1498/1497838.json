He was closing in on her, and she was running for her lifeâ€”until fate tore away her last hope. Her brother was dying, and the sky-high medical bills were crushing her. Victor narrowed his cold eyes and said, \"Be my woman, and I'll save him.\" She was forced to sign a marriage contract. She resisted his world but indulged in his protection and tenderness. When she found out that the mysterious man who saved her on the rainy night five years ago was actually him, the boundary between hate and love completely collapsed.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2025-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Sweet Contract with the Mafia Boss","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2025-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
