At all historical times, Ukraine has given birth to warriors whose worldview was based on the desire for freedom and the willingness to give up everything for it, even their lives. Different generations of warriors depicted in the film are manifestations of the same tradition, in which the fight for freedom is the most important principle.  “Polemos” reveals a centuries-old history through the prism of warriors who constantly face their deaths in a battle and a kind of dialog, which the film shows through a chess game. Realizing that the outcome is predetermined, the warriors defy fate anyway.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Polemos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5500798,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Evgen Brooks","original_name":"Evgen Brooks","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684af023c0533d958c1eb9b1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
