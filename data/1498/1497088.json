Here she experiences wild rivers, dangerous animals and scary men for the first time. In the beginning, it doesn't go so well with city habits in a mountain cabin - especially not when the father likes to bring all kinds of animals into the cabin. But afterwards, life gets easier. Charlie, or Charlotte as she is called, turns out to be able to cope with all difficulties like a grown-up mountain man.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mountain Charlie","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1192991,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dick Robinson","original_name":"Dick Robinson","popularity":0.1885,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Papa Brewer","credit_id":"684b12b6e9853a7c1ebb41d3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1418554,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"George Stapleford","original_name":"George Stapleford","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684b12883a8b229c57bb4288","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0312980","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1982-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
