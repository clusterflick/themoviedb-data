One summer's evening, two ageing writers, Hirst and Spooner, meet in a Hampstead pub and continue their drinking into the night at Hirst's stately house nearby. As the pair become increasingly inebriated, and their stories increasingly unbelievable, the lively conversations turns into a revealing power game, further complicated by the return home of two sinister younger men.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Man's Land","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Stewart","original_name":"Patrick Stewart","popularity":3.9279,"profile_path":"/3yExCGqCMfSOVVHdEYTJhXaTtFZ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Hirst","credit_id":"684b435f31a9835f87293f7e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian McKellen","original_name":"Ian McKellen","popularity":3.0605,"profile_path":"/5cnnnpnJG6TiYUSS7qgJheUZgnv.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Spooner","credit_id":"684b437421ccec3aa534399a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1240398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damien Molony","original_name":"Damien Molony","popularity":0.721,"profile_path":"/foOwuCmNAzlumiVGLj6S1McmdJj.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Foster","credit_id":"684b438f104285654a1be603","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58654,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Owen Teale","original_name":"Owen Teale","popularity":1.5461,"profile_path":"/fEr21q41i2e92wqKdoxeFdbDZva.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Briggs","credit_id":"684b43a71f6d18e6513fdd62","order":3}],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":230318,"name":"live theatre"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
