When sculptor Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins unveiled the Crystal Palace Dinosaurs to the public in 1854, they were the first ever life-sized depictions of extinct animals. Whilst hugely inaccurate according to our modern understanding, they now represent an important milestone in the history of science. They're also one of South London's most beloved and charming attractions. Over the years, the sculptures have fallen into disrepair thanks to a lack of funding, perennial vandalism and the forces of nature. But a passionate group of local residents have banded together to keep the statues standing. With the help of a world-famous rockstar, can they stop our dinosaurs from going extinct?","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Dinosaurs","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt36316179","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
