The film uses stark, disturbing imagery to reveal how these rituals inflict wounds that are more than symbolic, they are lifelong scars, carved into the body and soul. The crucified child bride becomes the ultimate manifestation of this suffering: a living sacrifice to tradition, marked forever.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/bQSJ3kiTWXfcHLu2gXIkb0FyQLV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stigmata","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4530577,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Malaksima Mammadova","original_name":"Mələksima Məmmədova","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/vuCpHYsn0kg1IefPIwMZYoF3z4W.jpg","credit_id":"684c84e5e8c608addb343e80","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4530577,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Malaksima Mammadova","original_name":"Mələksima Məmmədova","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":"/vuCpHYsn0kg1IefPIwMZYoF3z4W.jpg","credit_id":"684c84f89ea5102d9f1ec02f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2048,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bQSJ3kiTWXfcHLu2gXIkb0FyQLV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":1,"width":1447}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
