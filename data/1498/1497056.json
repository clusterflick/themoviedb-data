Frustrated at not being able to come up with an innovative story, she asks for help from two friends who are actors, Jorge (Guttho Lekan) and Júlia (Rebeca Knopf). However, their strong personalities result in more problems. With existential crises and depression, she needs to consult with her psychologist Gustavo (Vinicius Daza), who advises her to have more experiences than she has already had. With the great problems that this advice brings her, she discovers that the greatest story was right in front of her.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/c7JwbgKs3XKIOl8mUFjlAcrgHWR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When love and sadness combine, beautiful stories are created!","title":"The Screenwriter's Tale","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5500876,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carolina Zanella","original_name":"Carolina Zanella","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Alice","credit_id":"684b05504ef4c4bee6294040","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5500878,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Guttho Lekan","original_name":"Guttho Lekan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Jorge","credit_id":"684b0572ef546c95c5294098","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3566100,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rebeca Knopf","original_name":"Rebeca Knopf","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Júlia","credit_id":"684b05823a4a643d7e3ded5f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2786398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinicius Daza","original_name":"Vinicius Daza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sArax0kPaBpGbCneRU9RMYTdu5H.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Gustavo","credit_id":"684b0593b518dfdcb23ded7a","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5497214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanna Pedroso","original_name":"Giovanna Pedroso","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/9bw2pkBT93XdgraZOKl5yy57c81.jpg","credit_id":"684b05aff04aaafb783fdaa1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5497214,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanna Pedroso","original_name":"Giovanna Pedroso","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":"/9bw2pkBT93XdgraZOKl5yy57c81.jpg","credit_id":"684b05bf5d0fcf77305c6fa9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2786399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caio Coppoli","original_name":"Caio Coppoli","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684b05d8905436f1ae3ded63","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3188340,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matheus Narciso","original_name":"Matheus Narciso","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684b05fdb1d362cf68b0d4fc","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3188329,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Giovanna Leme","original_name":"Giovanna Leme","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684b06177a71a3dba3bb3fd1","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2786398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinicius Daza","original_name":"Vinicius Daza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sArax0kPaBpGbCneRU9RMYTdu5H.jpg","credit_id":"684b062cebf6e66ca4b0d59a","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2786398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vinicius Daza","original_name":"Vinicius Daza","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/sArax0kPaBpGbCneRU9RMYTdu5H.jpg","credit_id":"684b063e3274647c4d293fa1","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2560564,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aline Marques","original_name":"Aline Marques","popularity":0.0393,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684b06592cedac61195c704f","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2786399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Caio Coppoli","original_name":"Caio Coppoli","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"684b0675d669235de0bb431f","department":"Production","job":"Casting"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nhPVovpPoUB0Gib23X2yVbn6UDU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":2245,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/c7JwbgKs3XKIOl8mUFjlAcrgHWR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1587}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":11331,"name":"tale"},{"id":179969,"name":"screenwriting"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"pt","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
