Here the exploitation system is precisely exposed. Deportees (from Angola) disembark from a boat. After the humiliating inspection of the bodies, it is the signature, on the finger, of the contract. Then are shown the works – cultivation, harvesting, bagging of cocoa -, as well as “education” and recreation. Contratados were forced into forced labour in violent and abusive conditions. This system, which replaced slavery, remained in force in the African colonies until 1961.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1929-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"São Tomé - Agricultural and Industrial","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3468900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Augusto Seara","original_name":"Augusto Seara","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6233591a5a07f500753d930e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
