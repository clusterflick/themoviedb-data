The activities and customs of the Guineans are filmed with a lot of attention and sometimes of proximity. Their resistance to colonization is even evoked, cleverly recovered by the comment which claims that they are all Portuguese. But the colonists are very few present: some dressed in a sparkling white costume and two very poor. The Africans, proud, talented, imposing, occupy the whole film.","popularity":0.0757,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1946-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guinea-Bissau, Cradle of the Empire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":536712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"António Lopes Ribeiro","original_name":"António Lopes Ribeiro","popularity":0.0708,"profile_path":"/aziF90Jhp2WrdyPGkdujkZQrt4s.jpg","credit_id":"62335fda53866e001eaeeb5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1888993,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Vieira de Sousa","original_name":"Vieira de Sousa","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63306e89629b2c007aa5b775","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1946-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
