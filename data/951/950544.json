Evoking subconscious memory, Remains Vivid recalls childhood experiences through use of the \"after-image,\" while Over/Time subtly transposes physical and temporal distance as contrasting, equally resonant landscapes. POV explores the subjective eye versus the camera eye, and the nature of artistic creation. Using a split-screen technique, Similar Nature dissects the activities of four people in a study of time, motion, and simultaneity of gesture. Sax and Violins is a conflation of sound and fragmented image in which the musicians perform separately and are brought together only in the post-production process.","popularity":0.1255,"poster_path":"/gXvctN9A8fozXjFF0buKGIt4vXL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resolution of the Eye","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1768911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kit Fitzgerald","original_name":"Kit Fitzgerald","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6233cf31d7cd06001cd84e7a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1371171,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Sanborn","original_name":"John Sanborn","popularity":0.0614,"profile_path":"/1OVLASxrZi1F8FaQmIAyFjfJ7TK.jpg","credit_id":"6233cf2723bcf4007c74cde1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/gXvctN9A8fozXjFF0buKGIt4vXL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1980-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
