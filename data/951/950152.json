The film follows the 36-year-old chef, who is as much an artist as a cook, during the six months leading up to the championship and tells the story of an occupation that seems more like an elite sport than anything else. It provides a rare glimpse into Rasmus’ world and the time, passion and belief in oneself necessary to achieve the excellence to become the world’s best Master Chef.","popularity":0.0322,"poster_path":"/93Le7DlHCQa52NN06lGQmRv26xZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29062,"logo_path":"/hwlA6f2HhaOJP1ZcrYL8f8g8UbJ.png","name":"Final Cut for Real","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2011-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The World's Finest Chef","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1342732,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rasmus Dinesen","original_name":"Rasmus Dinesen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/lLA93Sk88dbqBktU9LorgCvNdf9.jpg","credit_id":"637e6b596e938a00a0eac658","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2309548","wikidata_id":"Q20496401","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.659,"height":768,"iso_639_1":"da","file_path":"/93Le7DlHCQa52NN06lGQmRv26xZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":506}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"da","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Verdens Bedste kok (The Worlds best chef) - Premiere","key":"184489421","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2016-09-27T09:13:09.000Z","id":"62335a71894ed6001c937d11"}]}}}
