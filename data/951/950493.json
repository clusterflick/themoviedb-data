The 600-mile route follows a connection of mostly unpaved back roads that can be ridden on dual-sport and adventure motorcycles or driven in 4×4 and high-clearance 4WD vehicles. The route is usually snow-free July through September.  When Bryce Stevens and Andrew Cull won the 2010 Overland Flag Competition for their proposal to create an off-road route across the state of Washington, they decided to make their vision a reality. In the spring of 2010, the two adventure motorcyclists from the Northwest began scouting and mapping a new off-road route across Washington State from Oregon to Canada for dual-sport adventure motorcycles and 4×4 vehicles.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/kJowuHmXUvfy0wzkQXhJutrZGvS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Washington BDR","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469285,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sterling Noren","original_name":"Sterling Noren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6233a897a24232001d6c3557","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469293,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Helge Pedersen","original_name":"Helge Pedersen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6233a8d7da10f0001c88b1f4","department":"Crew","job":"Film Processor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469294,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Radek Burket","original_name":"Radek Burket","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6233a8f34c1d9a0046565bee","department":"Crew","job":"Film Processor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469295,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Andrew Cull","original_name":"Andrew Cull","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6233a90634e15200733bd789","department":"Crew","job":"Film Processor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469296,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Helge Pedersen","original_name":"Helge Pedersen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6233a91d23bcf4007c7450b3","department":"Crew","job":"Film Processor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469297,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sterling Noren","original_name":"Sterling Noren","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6233a99453866e001eafe33f","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469298,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Helge Pedersen","original_name":"Helge Pedersen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6233a9b45a07f500753ec997","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Photo Retouching"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469299,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Don Stephanian","original_name":"Don Stephanian","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6233a9d1da10f00046b885c6","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Photo Retouching"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.703,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kJowuHmXUvfy0wzkQXhJutrZGvS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":527}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"WABDR - Washington Backcountry Discovery Route - Trailer","key":"jm2qg4MDuGc","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2011-03-10T01:20:33.000Z","id":"6233a705904f6d007520fca6"}]}}}
