The buildings and roads, built by Africans, commanded by settlers. The agricultural facilities, the hospital. Then the camera lingers with a certain fascination on dances – including warriors – and topless women. This curious documentary concludes with two “visions of the future”: a Portuguese dance of white and black schoolchildren, and the graduation of Portuguese teenagers.","popularity":0.1187,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1929-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colonial Action of the Portuguese","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3468909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"António Antunes da Mata","original_name":"António Antunes da Mata","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62335b742495ab0045f47d6a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143148,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"César de Sá","original_name":"César de Sá","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62335b894c1d9a004655459e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1929-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
