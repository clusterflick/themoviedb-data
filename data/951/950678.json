This won't happen today. Knowledge of geology and climatology has blocked humans' curiosity from wandering around the unknown world. The precisely depicted continents, oceans, islands and mountains seemingly announced the death of primitive mythology. This film tries to reboot an individual's search of nature, just like Don Quixote's rebellious journey. The key to this Pandora's box can be merely an unexpected turbulent incident in an individual's life.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/lBRZ1OOxP1iJUTPZxuoQmjmfMXB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2020-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kayaking","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13897162","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lBRZ1OOxP1iJUTPZxuoQmjmfMXB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"zh","note":"","release_date":"2020-06-03T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
