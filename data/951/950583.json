On the road, Olivier and Angelina are hitchhiking. The kidnapping of a hitchhiker is never reported in the news. Angélina, kidnapped, is taken to a château for an evening of gallantry. She is made to drink, falls for a man, and the others take advantage of the situation, all night long. Olivier's situation, left alone on the road, doesn't improve. He's looking for Angelina. At the same time, the gendarmes are looking for the escapee from the Melun prison. Olivier, mistaken for the escapee, is pursued all night by the gendarmes. For both Angélina and Olivier, the night is one long corridor. In the morning, the outcome is brutal, inhuman. Angélina is left alone, naked.","popularity":0.3667,"poster_path":"/nuvYMnUT1BGSgOVV0r8Vc0dEN2E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La dévoreuse","video":false,"vote_average":1,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469712,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominique Dumesnil","original_name":"Dominique Dumesnil","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"62341b9723bcf4001cdcd50c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469713,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valérie Boisgel","original_name":"Valérie Boisgel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"62341b9f904f6d001be34798","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":135624,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gérard-Antoine Huart","original_name":"Gérard-Antoine Huart","popularity":0.0402,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"62341ba9ba131b0049290e0b","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469714,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stan Rol","original_name":"Stan Rol","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"62341bafdb4ed600450c21d7","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54392,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claude Salez","original_name":"Claude Salez","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"62341bb7db4ed60073b21f1c","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2359467,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Meyer Berreby","original_name":"Meyer Berreby","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"62341bbf5a07f50044744124","order":5},{"adult":true,"gender":1,"id":44416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Stanford","original_name":"Pamela Stanford","popularity":2.394,"profile_path":"/bsH6DEBgVkAEWmy5OI3zMDOKWV9.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"62341bc946aed4007b13aed0","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1408113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nadia Vasil","original_name":"Nadia Vasil","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":"/xa37h0fIQSASw8XR6WEKOrmkipo.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"62341bd2904f6d007522c85a","order":7}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2184033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Teisseire","original_name":"André Teisseire","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62341b615a07f5007540bf23","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4628904,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Edmée Deniau","original_name":"Edmée Deniau","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660b84920b5fd6017c376cac","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2184033,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Teisseire","original_name":"André Teisseire","popularity":0.0496,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660b849d15dea0017c343e4a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4628905,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sabine de Bonneval","original_name":"Sabine de Bonneval","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"660b84a65aadc4017c644093","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0424980","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.661,"height":756,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/nuvYMnUT1BGSgOVV0r8Vc0dEN2E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-02-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
