An admirable woman, a survivor from the camps, a terrible woman. The imperious will to survive. I wouldn’t film her, ever. I didn’t want to look back, I didn’t want to hear of death, I didn’t want survival. I wanted life. I wanted to be free. Until Trude’s unbending way of speaking started to bend.

To film life and death, my own way, at the present.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Navire Europe","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Déak","original_name":"Marina Déak","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62346db934e152001cc319a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
