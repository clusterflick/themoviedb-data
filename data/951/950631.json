They take shelter in a boat, they tell each other repeated stories, of the village, of adults, of djins … and there they meet a strange woman … We immerse ourselves with them, close to dreams, and to an adult life that is still far but close.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La night au frioul","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469924,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sophie Amrani","original_name":"Sophie Amrani","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62345eca8e8d30001d0b78aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469925,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Claudia Mollese","original_name":"Claudia Mollese","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62345ed732489b001b7ba0f7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Camelia Chemintou","original_name":"Camelia Chemintou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62345ee6db4ed600450c9c65","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469927,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yasmin Chemintou","original_name":"Yasmin Chemintou","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62345ef38e8d3000783bc55d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469928,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elina Chared","original_name":"Elina Chared","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62345f0153866e004854f546","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469929,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mariama Djoco Manel Hachemi","original_name":"Mariama Djoco Manel Hachemi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62345f1134e15200461944da","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1763690,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nicola Bergamaschi","original_name":"Nicola Bergamaschi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62345f1f894ed60046706a76","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2872926,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Matti Sutcliffe","original_name":"Matti Sutcliffe","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62345f2cdb4ed60073b28c6b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469932,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adrien Von Nagel","original_name":"Adrien Von Nagel","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62345f38894ed6007947e353","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3469933,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rouaida Youssouf","original_name":"Rouaida Youssouf","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"62345f4432489b001b7ba20f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
