The documentary follows his campaign across Kentucky from the most urban to the most rural settings. Booker and his team rewrite the campaign playbook. They lean into the charge that average Kentuckians have common bonds, a unifying day-to-day struggle. That struggle is color blind. Booker fights to represent Kentuckians that feel invisible. His message is simple whether you are from the city “Hood,” or the Appalachian “Holler,” you are not invisible.","popularity":0.0951,"poster_path":"/mti2Z1fJw2VCTv7UlX6d5wKfAHC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From the Hood to the Holler","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2287249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pat McGee","original_name":"Pat McGee","popularity":0.0648,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6232ac0fdb4ed6001bf27538","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt20672924","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/mti2Z1fJw2VCTv7UlX6d5wKfAHC.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8zGxbeAjnR4UlKCQHiAjgflb7en.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":1726,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/70keP581GzXgGZ9lfaa4y7ARFxr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1148}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2022-09-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"FROM THE HOOD TO THE HOLLER - sneak peek","key":"632086088","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-10-14T15:13:23.000Z","id":"6232ab5ad18b240077961ece"}]}}}
