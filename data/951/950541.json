Set in the Florida Everglades, this ambitious piece is a contemporary fairy tale. A young woman struggles to free herself from a small town and her demanding, eccentric family. Her search leads to her doppelganger, a mysterious woman — half-human, half-bird — who lives in the mangrove swamps outside town. In confronting the psychological Other, she comes to terms with her own spiritual dilemma. This quest for self-identity resonates with the archetypal themes of such fairy tales as Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella. In a narrative shot through with ambiguity and hidden meanings, the languorous, menacing landscape acts as a visual metaphor for the human imagination.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everglades City","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2303855,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Matthew Geller","original_name":"Matthew Geller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6233cb8e5a07f500753f4ded","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
