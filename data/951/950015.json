After years of managed decline, regeneration is looming for Chrisp Street Market. A Registered Social Landlord, a property developer, and a Labour authority seek to create their vision of “the New Shoreditch”, with a brief to “change the social mix” of this 9-acre site, situated in the shadow of Canary Wharf, no matter the cost to the established community.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Battle of Chrisp Street","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3467596,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rab Harling","original_name":"Rab Harling","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6231c051ec0c580077cc277f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2018-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
