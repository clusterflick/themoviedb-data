Wheeler and Walter, yeggmen, see the money and trail the traveler to the station. The men learn the berth he is to occupy. Hastening to a bridge under which the train must pass, they drop to the roof of one of the cars when it appears. Helen, transferred to Burnett, is a passenger on the train. By mistake, Griffin gets into her berth. Because of the man's condition, Helen consents to allow him to keep her berth. The girl takes the one which Griffin's ticket calls for. An hour later, Helen is awakened by a peculiar noise outside the car. Hastily dressing, she sees the window being raised. Wheeler's face appears at the window. The man foils Helen's attempt to shoot him, disarms her and then climbs back to the roof of the car.","popularity":0.111,"poster_path":"/nelvhFPqwYhAw8UFF81sDpFZSlD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46167,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kalem Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Midnight Limited","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1072383,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Holmes","original_name":"Helen Holmes","popularity":0.1313,"profile_path":"/nautzlUkBuQv5VJLL6ZjdKwNpy4.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Helen","credit_id":"6233c80403bf840046596a51","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1139067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George A.
