Thanks to this unpublished material, the movie paints a fresco of factory life in what used to be Europe’s biggest metalworking factory.","popularity":0.2838,"poster_path":"/s4F0Z9jQ17ARWONqw4pVeG17Zck.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinefonie","origin_country":""},{"id":234364,"logo_path":null,"name":"FIOM Torino e Piemonte","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Senzachiederepermesso","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2864441,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pier Milanese","original_name":"Pier Milanese","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669b9e5dda9a34471995433b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pietro Perotti","original_name":"Pietro Perotti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669b9e6e613a18499c7770f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pietro Perotti","original_name":"Pietro Perotti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669b9e7643a0d1fb9a954357","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2114938,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pietro Perotti","original_name":"Pietro Perotti","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669b9e8656d3559e9868252f","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4840018,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alessandro Costanza","original_name":"Alessandro Costanza","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669b9e962d3dedd153de9725","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4840019,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Daina Pupkeviciute","original_name":"Daina Pupkeviciute","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669b9ea01749839bf88eabce","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1722358,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Monica Affatato","original_name":"Monica Affatato","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669b9ea80dcdec8a06954369","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2864441,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Pier Milanese","original_name":"Pier Milanese","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669b9eb1b55beca3cec53963","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4840020,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Franco Ranghino","original_name":"Franco Ranghino","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669b9ebe2911f7b4eede952d","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2864440,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paolo Favaro","original_name":"Paolo Favaro","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669b9eca71785de87b8b9899","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2348538,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Luciano D'Onofrio","original_name":"Luciano D'Onofrio","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"669b9ed52294f2f7fdde9968","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt11098746","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/nvJGWlK4ujq4qaEUyvC2yNoHn2I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":1920,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s4F0Z9jQ17ARWONqw4pVeG17Zck.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1358}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":730,"name":"factory worker"},{"id":1382,"name":"factory"},{"id":323138,"name":"mirafiori"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"it","note":"","release_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"SENZACHIEDEREPERMESSO trailer","key":"114958685","site":"Vimeo","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2014-12-19T09:47:02.000Z","id":"669ba316073923ad49181fd8"}]}}}
