Caswell, Jr.’s play is a wildly theatrical, hilarious, and genre-twisting gallop through the experience of a woman reborn.","popularity":0.7079,"poster_path":"/3dFgq0A7tjbEbb3Gf3MSzvqxTiE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147740,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vineyard Theatre","origin_country":""},{"id":197940,"logo_path":null,"name":"The League of Live Stream Theater","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scene Partners","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1902,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dianne Wiest","original_name":"Dianne Wiest","popularity":1.3697,"profile_path":"/p9mfzY68FtEbedOMNB5X4eBShhx.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Meryl Kowalski","credit_id":"6580c80334e152084508022b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1620981,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eric Berryman","original_name":"Eric Berryman","popularity":0.1346,"profile_path":"/jLAMItci2V87HpdX3fTGS9ZY72I.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Chuck + Others","credit_id":"6580c80e7e403d097bf4f2d2","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38672,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Johanna Day","original_name":"Johanna Day","popularity":0.2228,"profile_path":"/ApaUFpdlvXRgZ6T4cx0srgWOxQN.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Charlize","credit_id":"6580c814226c5607fe9e8d5c","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":52419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josh Hamilton","original_name":"Josh Hamilton","popularity":0.7564,"profile_path":"/7nuAUPd7E8iOE5lhUcNpogS2akP.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Hugo + Others","credit_id":"6580c821df86a808f9e82879","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1617456,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carmen M.
