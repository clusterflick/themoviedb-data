Nobody opens it. When he leaves the place, he sees some bushes moving and goes into a wooded path. Along the way, from his memories, he faces several episodes of fear in his life until he reaches the exit of the path, which takes him back to the door of the house. Tomás enters and talks with a woman (who represents death), at which point he decides to face his fears.","popularity":0.7481,"poster_path":"/eA79VAl3h9ZSkNpB5TsklGWIW0k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":215934,"logo_path":null,"name":"Punto 8 Entertaiment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2019-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A way for Tomás","video":false,"vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4427239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sebastián Gómez","original_name":"Sebastián Gómez","popularity":0.0579,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Tomás young","credit_id":"657f533b124c8d07c838b7b9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4435566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sergio Dávila Llinás","original_name":"Sergio Dávila Llinás","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Tomás adult","credit_id":"657f535aea84c7163eb867e0","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4427241,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Andrea Bedoya","original_name":"Paula Andrea Bedoya","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Lady Dead","credit_id":"657f537cb6c2640905b790e7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4435567,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"José Naranjo","original_name":"José Naranjo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Tomás kid","credit_id":"657f53b2ea84c7167cb84842","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4433802,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Verónica Lopera","original_name":"Verónica Lopera","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Eloísa","credit_id":"657f53c5904f6d07627f6ab7","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4433797,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Daniel Jaramillo","original_name":"Daniel Jaramillo","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657f55a807291c083c3ec7e4","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4427249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martín Agudelo Ramírez","original_name":"Martín Agudelo Ramírez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657f54fc4f33ad0790d1d462","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4427250,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrés Ricaurte Múnera","original_name":"Andrés Ricaurte Múnera","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657f54e7124c8d0749397cea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":4427249,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Martín Agudelo Ramírez","original_name":"Martín Agudelo Ramírez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657f54d2323eba5c7e87a9c2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4433787,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"La Banda del Bisonte","original_name":"La Banda del Bisonte","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657f557d124c8d0749397d1f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1756363,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Mateo Londoño","original_name":"Mateo Londoño","popularity":0.0526,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6754f0eea18cb8695afd59fb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13461770","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1280,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eA79VAl3h9ZSkNpB5TsklGWIW0k.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":854},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":959,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/attjZSJ8MsI0JhFshgcYHwx3SmX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":640}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1587,"name":"way of life"},{"id":5774,"name":"forest"},{"id":10909,"name":"lawyer"},{"id":160153,"name":"dead"},{"id":284631,"name":"law"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"es","note":"","release_date":"2019-11-26T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"A WAY FOR TOMAS short film, audience feedback Aug. 2023 FANTASY/SCI-FI Festival","key":"yMLTn1tjByU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":false,"published_at":"2023-08-31T02:50:57.000Z","id":"657f520448333a677ecb028c"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Un camino para Tomás","key":"2tHLlG6ZrUU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Featurette","official":false,"published_at":"2021-02-11T16:00:13.000Z","id":"657f52fc124c8d221e3896b4"},{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"MAKING OF.
