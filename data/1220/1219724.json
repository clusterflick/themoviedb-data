For filmmaker Alexandra Gulea, this question of heritage is connected to the name she shares with her grandmother, who was born into a traditional Aromanian life, and is fluent only in an Aromanian language. The older Alexandra's father suffered a violent death in an uprising for his people's rights, which forced the family out of Greece and into a politically treacherous Balkan landscape deep in the throes of nationalist upheavals, until finally, they found a home in Romania.","popularity":0.4002,"poster_path":"/mliZUwLYczdI45Bj0sFUGOFr56Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51666,"logo_path":"/jFrQ2vAaevoPqqbmpr2JnFIj7C5.png","name":"Weltfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":216359,"logo_path":"/erFi5Rf1gfNgze7h2MiltkRhISZ.png","name":"Anchor
