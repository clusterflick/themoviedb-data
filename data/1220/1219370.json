The film offers rare access to Luna Luna's artists as they painted their rides and attractions, culminating in the excitement of being at the fairgrounds surrounded by performers, crowds, and music. The camera walks us through the artist-designed pavilions and takes us for a ride on Jean-Michel Basquiat's Ferris wheel. The soundtrack includes some of the music heard on the rides and attractions at the park: first Miles Davis's \"Tutu\", played on Basquiat's Ferris wheel, followed by a number of songs by Philip Glass (who contributed music to Roy Lichtenstein's pavilion), and finally, Blue Chip Orchestra's composition for Salvador Dalí's dome.","popularity":0.0402,"poster_path":"/zRX5ynsqiHoApncBvkDwpfN8Nf6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2023-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"André Heller's Luna Luna","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1532040,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Heinz Bütler","original_name":"Heinz Bütler","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657fa686226c5608199dc30c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":936,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zRX5ynsqiHoApncBvkDwpfN8Nf6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":624}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Opening of Luna Luna: Forgotten Fantasy.
