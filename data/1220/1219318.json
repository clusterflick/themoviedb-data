It was shot in Cismigiu Gardens, one of the oldest public parks in Bucharest. This central, urban space attracts people from all walks of life. It is a place for social interaction, solitary reflection, reverie, and memory. Interweaving recollections of the past with present-day scenes from the park, the film presents a montage of stillness and motion, images and voices, landscapes and people.","popularity":0.0528,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Light of Memory","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4435877,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alyssa Grossman","original_name":"Alyssa Grossman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"657f7e2a394a87080b73ffa9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
