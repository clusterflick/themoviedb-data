Filmed across Tournon-sur-Rhône, Aix-en-Provence and Dakar, Dombrowsky-M’Baye’s Seuteu unravels an archaeology of her matrilineal ancestry. Carried by the air, we drift in and over homes, bodies of water, landscapes and atmospheres – contemplating the space between memory and lived experience.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/xCOtdPCykusxIVjSm9iveOCsxQS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Wolof","iso_639_1":"wo","name":"Wolof"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seuteu","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4437864,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soukeyna M'Baye","original_name":"Soukeyna M'Baye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Air","credit_id":"65810838df86a80918e82de7","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4437867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yana Dombrowsky-M'Baye","original_name":"Yana Dombrowsky-M'Baye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581084ecedac408617d5c5e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4437863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yana Dombrowsky-M'Baye","original_name":"Yana Dombrowsky-M'Baye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65810867226c56083a9e7339","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4437867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yana Dombrowsky-M'Baye","original_name":"Yana Dombrowsky-M'Baye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658108752f8d0908d5a87e40","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4437869,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Xavier Ellah","original_name":"Xavier Ellah","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581089f34e15208bf078096","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4437867,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Yana Dombrowsky-M'Baye","original_name":"Yana Dombrowsky-M'Baye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658108cbdf86a80918e82e2f","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4437863,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yana Dombrowsky-M'Baye","original_name":"Yana Dombrowsky-M'Baye","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6581088d875d1a0801ae9b12","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2588,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xCOtdPCykusxIVjSm9iveOCsxQS.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1726}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2023-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
