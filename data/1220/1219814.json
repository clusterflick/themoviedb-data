As tools, he merely has his computer and files of his own films, as well as masses of faces long gone and places razed from memory. One drifts deliciously with Klopfenstein through a super-edit of his own oeuvre, removed from established modes of this type of filmmaking and instead functioning in an intimate and poignant expression, where fleeting gestures can unleash avalanches of unexpected memories.","popularity":0.3381,"poster_path":"/vTPRfxcuEyUtcLBdbMfXc4Ss4op.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":217815,"logo_path":"/jBRpBJ0rKzxOi8Y3SM8VKUwViy5.png","name":"Clemens Klopfenstein","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2024-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinema Bruciato","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clemens Klopfenstein","original_name":"Clemens Klopfenstein","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/xj3x6qFUtmHTlHQFBoD3rtgxdTE.jpg","credit_id":"6580deabbf0f6308756256e1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clemens Klopfenstein","original_name":"Clemens Klopfenstein","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/xj3x6qFUtmHTlHQFBoD3rtgxdTE.jpg","credit_id":"659b294f7e12f0019db9f9da","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clemens Klopfenstein","original_name":"Clemens Klopfenstein","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/xj3x6qFUtmHTlHQFBoD3rtgxdTE.jpg","credit_id":"659b29538741c400ef30b924","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1939512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Kaur Bedi","original_name":"Maria Kaur Bedi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659b295a1d1bf400f3a044b2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":221437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Clemens Klopfenstein","original_name":"Clemens Klopfenstein","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":"/xj3x6qFUtmHTlHQFBoD3rtgxdTE.jpg","credit_id":"659b2963bd588b4df804ae6c","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1939512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Kaur Bedi","original_name":"Maria Kaur Bedi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659b29687d550402617a264e","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1939512,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Maria Kaur Bedi","original_name":"Maria Kaur Bedi","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"659b296ea1074b0148b0a6aa","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1086274,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benedikt Jeger","original_name":"Benedikt Jeger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/gqdlb9WFmvMxWA6FEeKEEKZ2YwQ.jpg","credit_id":"659b297b4d0e8d00ee41ab2b","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/9FHFSmxqwkxqLhLjKshgeo1dxX5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/vTPRfxcuEyUtcLBdbMfXc4Ss4op.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
