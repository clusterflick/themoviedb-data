Antonisz was an almost self-sufficient artist. He wrote scripts for his films and made them himself. He also composed music for them. In 1977, in his artistic manifesto, he formulated a vision of a film created directly on film and from then on he consistently made films using this technique. It involved abandoning the use of a camera: individual frames were drawn, painted or scratched on the tape. He was fascinated by mechanical devices. He himself constructed various \"film machines\" used when working on non-camera films.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/74g3kQUF5b4ZTZTWMepFRILE83p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jak Antoniszczak Robił Swiat","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/74g3kQUF5b4ZTZTWMepFRILE83p.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
