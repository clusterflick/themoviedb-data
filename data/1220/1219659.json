To protect him, the wife has hidden him away in a tiny cell located beneath the duck house at her parents' farm. At first all is well, but after a while boredom and claustrophobia set in for the man who can see his loved ones, but is never allowed to be with them. It is hard on the wife who becomes increasingly lonely and enticed by the overtures of an insistent customs official.","popularity":0.1259,"poster_path":"/sMCyMdEy90ucXRHuw0rX9KCaIDh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Az asszony","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1313296,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Györgyi","original_name":"Anna Györgyi","popularity":0.0775,"profile_path":"/30YZcsham0I5Lv8ar9OWx9UuGRd.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"65b893965be00e0161599dc4","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Károly Eperjes","original_name":"Károly Eperjes","popularity":0.0357,"profile_path":"/hSpZ4AG5LzBZqgjHamqd1lN0spa.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Katona Janos","credit_id":"65b893a230f79c0183a97231","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451077,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dezső Zsigmond","original_name":"Dezső Zsigmond","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b89376e9da69017bf3808e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1451077,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dezső Zsigmond","original_name":"Dezső Zsigmond","popularity":0.0621,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b8937c2d937501839463c5","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"János Erdélyi","original_name":"János Erdélyi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b8938890fca3017b065494","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1120381,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"János Erdélyi","original_name":"János Erdélyi","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65b8936c2d937501839463a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0118649","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/sMCyMdEy90ucXRHuw0rX9KCaIDh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1995-12-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
