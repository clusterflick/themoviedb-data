As the film captures small moments of wonder and the subtle changes occurring over days, we witness humans, dogs, sheep, chickens, goats and several other animals engage in their daily affairs. With the introduction of a male goat to the farm, a mating ritual briefly ensues, but in the end, everything seems cyclical once again.","popularity":0.0538,"poster_path":"/nTOeVrpcQP5olJuR385lAg1uAvR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":220214,"logo_path":null,"name":"CineDogs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2024-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Few Mornings, an Evening","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4437204,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Astrid van Nimwegen","original_name":"Astrid van Nimwegen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"65809c8c2f8d0908f4a81c33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31116907","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kNwnszknmOWdXM1rUzgXPkjhH6E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/nTOeVrpcQP5olJuR385lAg1uAvR.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":774,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zmLlYknvIFlMk3Q6D3IWAYB1Nn7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":515},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"nl","file_path":"/mfjzr99enCFAvU2NeF068TBkcQr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","release_dates":[{"certification":"All","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Jeonju International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2024-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"AL","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-05-02T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
