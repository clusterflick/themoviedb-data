In short: facts and fictions freely intermingle.","popularity":0.0781,"poster_path":"/n1d50YaVf4cIPrYBaT83dqyO17Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21534,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kairos-Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2024-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cosmic Miniatures","video":false,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":50870,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alexander Kluge","original_name":"Alexander Kluge","popularity":0.2615,"profile_path":"/3zC5rpInRtutN29trvMIXJV3cx0.jpg","credit_id":"65809b89bf0f6308756241c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt31939123","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xGoxZhmyXr7hn3qESo9G2FZPP2L.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yqFQE4mrVbG8nJKttHcciGS6qvw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":3840}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/rem2WjZr6dlS21YmQGTkgWj4OmF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/n1d50YaVf4cIPrYBaT83dqyO17Z.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/zCke2kOEm2sk9Nfh9BXzpfpzE2U.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":2,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2024-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
