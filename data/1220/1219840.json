Fascinating, unnerving, funny and unlike anything you've seen before.","popularity":0.0261,"poster_path":"/aUwx9tmOcyUNS9j41cAnqN6Idf2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2024-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Petticoat Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2550855,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mox Mäkelä","original_name":"Mox Mäkelä","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6580e983bf0f630875627228","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aUwx9tmOcyUNS9j41cAnqN6Idf2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
