Through the artist's own narration, the film reflects on how the navigational abilities of birds have been understood, and misunderstood, through legends as much as through scientific experiments. Although we may have come a long way since Aristotle ÃÅs theory of bird hibernation, or the belief in annual migration to the Moon, many researchers admit that the knowledge we have obtained is, if anything, leaving us with even greater questions. At the heart of this comical expedition, the movie opposes the way in which these questions are being asked.","popularity":0.0336,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mystery of Bird Navigation","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2301457,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tor-Finn Malum Fitje","original_name":"Tor-Finn Malum Fitje","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"658081f134e152084507f478","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2016-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
