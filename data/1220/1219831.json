Ali Cherri creates a universe in which a suspended and void time opens the door to ghostly presences from a past made of war. Shot with an extreme and detailed precision of vision and sound, The Watchman is an urgent film that deconstructs the myth of duty, laying bare the absurdity of the omnipresent war rhetoric.","popularity":0.7626,"poster_path":"/sILAEXt9ny5EZQPhcQHtqTdFyGb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148901,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fondazione In Between Art Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":74861,"logo_path":"/jBaVCWMfqTdg3C8at4nDxIzRzpT.png","name":"KinoElektron","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2024-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Watchman","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4437679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Halil Ersev Gökçek","original_name":"Halil Ersev Gökçek","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sergeant Bulut","credit_id":"6580e597d5191f08a4adb5d3","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4437678,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alessandro Rabottini","original_name":"Alessandro Rabottini","popularity":0.051,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6580e57e7e403d0946f509b0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1199246,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Cherri","original_name":"Ali Cherri","popularity":0.0625,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6580e5373a48c5538faf7983","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1199246,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ali Cherri","original_name":"Ali Cherri","popularity":0.0625,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6580e5218dbc33088999ed84","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1300810,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Denis Bedlow","original_name":"Denis Bedlow","popularity":0.0683,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6580e58e226c5607fe9eb0eb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2932490,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Leonardo Bigazzi","original_name":"Leonardo Bigazzi","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6580e572bf0f630875626b00","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1161907,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Janja Kralj","original_name":"Janja Kralj","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67945b5d3be0b7b6f323aaaf","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1290185,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Cynthia Zaven","original_name":"Cynthia Zaven","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67945bb75dd2531e8b485eef","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1406476,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bassem Fayad","original_name":"Bassem Fayad","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67945bf908c1729ec91872c5","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt30954113","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5jkBBmPccMG8XM5adg4FTR91Xx3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":900,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/sILAEXt9ny5EZQPhcQHtqTdFyGb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":600}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"La Roche-sur-Yon International Film Festival","release_date":"2024-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"2024-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
