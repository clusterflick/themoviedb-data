Is there such a thing as \"Good and Bad\" hair? How has the Eurocentric ideal of beauty influenced black hair through modern history? \"My Nappy Roots\" will vibrantly depict some of the complex social, political and cultural influences that have dominated the dialogue surrounding African and African American hairstyles from styling patterns and cultural trends to the business of black hair care products, services and advertising. The film will use the evolution of black hairstyles as a touchstone to address the broader struggle of African American people in their search for social control, identity and economic independence.","popularity":0.0214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Nappy Roots: A Journey Through Black Hair-itage","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4437669,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Regina Kimbell","original_name":"Regina Kimbell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6580e472d5191f08e0ada163","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":226018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Bluemke","original_name":"Jay Bluemke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6580e47fbf0f6308756268ff","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4437669,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Regina Kimbell","original_name":"Regina Kimbell","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6580e48fd5191f08c0adad2f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":226018,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jay Bluemke","original_name":"Jay Bluemke","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6580e49ad5191f08e0ada1a9","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4437670,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brighton Kimbell","original_name":"Brighton Kimbell","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6580e4a77e403d0963f4fc45","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0441779","wikidata_id":"Q6946142","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
