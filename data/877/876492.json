Racing against the time, he powerfully campaigns to expose the secret military orders that kept them in China years after Japan had surrendered. His journey starts from the hot spot of Asia, the Yasukuni shrine. His quest takes him to China, where he had once become the killing machine, and finds truths about the Japanese military as well as himself under the long spell by it. During his journey, he meets a Chinese old lady who was kidnapped, raped, and confined by the Japanese soldiers. From her, he hears a story of human evils - and even forgiveness.","popularity":0.0784,"poster_path":"/pUc1UbxtqLp5RBacyyy1W1SDDfH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Devil\" returns to China.","title":"The Ants","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3241905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Waichi Okumura","original_name":"Waichi Okumura","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/fd8W9aRtkMtF5VjIzeepFkIEmGr.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"61492d78a3d02700902fc6ff","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2655252,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kaoru Ikeya","original_name":"Kaoru Ikeya","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/rsb191HqOCiAfKeRBrG8B7mVI2s.jpg","credit_id":"61492c72a6ddcb008c01a98e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0844661","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/r4IrctPD5DOJII4GODUrxiKZzJk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/pUc1UbxtqLp5RBacyyy1W1SDDfH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"ja","note":"","release_date":"2006-07-22T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"終戦75年「蟻の兵隊」全国ツアー予告篇","key":"qWCBQ-AVbbk","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-06-27T23:01:31.000Z","id":"61492fd804863800618d95a0"}]}}}
