Human dignity, dignity as citizens of Ukraine, dignity as contemporaries who want to live here and now, despite the fact that society is not quite ready to perceive them completely as they are. because they are gay. The film is based on the conversation of the four heroes of the film, as well as on the own thoughts of thought leaders. They are talking about how and what the Revolution of Dignity of 2013-2014 and the fighting in Donbas affected the heroes themselves, their sense of dignity, as well as how society has changed its opinion about the LGBTQ+ community in Ukraine.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/1k7Nkk1kMTe423wfGv4DN1hpLft.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2021-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dialogues on Dignity","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Будьмо, гей.
