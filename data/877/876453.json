He himself had died several times over, as a survivor of four concentration camps: Auschwitz, Neuengamme, Dachau, and Buchenwald. From the moment of his liberation to the day he passed away last September, aged 106, he dedicated his life to helping tens of thousands of survivors on their arduous journeys to Palestine, and later

remembrance.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/6DJRxkJiLGr34zDsawRbiXvnYPC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2021-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A
