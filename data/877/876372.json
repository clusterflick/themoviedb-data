Born in Guatemala and adopted by an Israeli couple as a baby, Oren had a troublesome childhood despite all the love and support of his family. Misdiagnosed with autism and mental illness, put into a psychiatric ward after a suicide attempt, he found it even harder to connect with the world that labelled him as “not normal” in many different ways. One day, armed with a simple video camera, Oren embarks on a journey to meet his biological parents and things begin to change. Tomer Heymann’s film tells a compelling story of a young man coming-of-age and discovering his true self among different landscapes, cultures and languages.","popularity":0.094,"poster_path":"/yhISN1gBQwEsq3zCTngUTb3xrI2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Heymann Brothers Films","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":142770,"logo_path":null,"name":"The New Fund for Cinema and TV (NFCT)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GT","name":"Guatemala"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2021-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Not","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Anni lo","type":"transliteration"}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4250336,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oren Levi","original_name":"Oren Levi","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"self","credit_id":"64f423a3e0ca7f014f6bb08f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4250337,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tomer Heymann","original_name":"Tomer Heymann","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"64f423b79e45860100309b44","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1197640,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tomer Heymann","original_name":"Tomer Heymann","popularity":0.0998,"profile_path":"/gLahbtgnSWngqScPVW13yqzcC01.jpg","credit_id":"6148cfe57719d70064a3be27","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3246428","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yhISN1gBQwEsq3zCTngUTb3xrI2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Docaviv International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2021-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Moscow Jewish Film Festival","release_date":"2023-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"I AM NOT | Dokumentarfilm Trailer | DOK.fest 2022","key":"ABaTLIqcWJU","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2022-04-23T14:35:55.000Z","id":"64f423f03d43e00138f6bad4"}]}}}
