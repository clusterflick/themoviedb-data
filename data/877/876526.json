Besides, ‘@miriamfrompoland’ is a story, which presents a traditional, yet not quite typical, family with impressive observational virtuosity.","popularity":0.0475,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":30161,"logo_path":"/h6dniliQm3tgLXBggnXz5u0KpF9.png","name":"Krakowskie Biuro Festiwalowe","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":129370,"logo_path":"/c7OFocnzGIZ86DrcNAzosYNssKZ.png","name":"EC1 Łódź","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":213408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anagram Film","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2021-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"@miriamfrompoland","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":553059,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Piotr Szczepański","original_name":"Piotr Szczepański","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614942d89f0e19002b14d6ca","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3327898,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Błażej Moder","original_name":"Błażej Moder","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66411ee4340e9a9a7e36f423","department":"Production","job":"Co-Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1651832,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Robert Sędzicki","original_name":"Robert Sędzicki","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"67c70a69dd46bd2fd390910f","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-05-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
