Immediately after Israel attained statehood, Prime Minister David Ben Gurion established a national army into which several independent Jewish defense forces, small armies with their own political philosophies, were supposed to unite. However, on June 20, 1948, the Altalena arrived off Israel carrying 930 World War II refugees and a stockpile of ammunition amassed by the Irgun (one of the independent defense forces) in direct violation of Ben Gurion’s new military chain-of-command. In the midst of the ship’s landing and a cease-fire in the War of Independence, Ben Gurion gave the order to shell the ship, forcing Jews to fire on Jews and almost sparking a civil war.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Altalena","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3241712,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ilana Tsur","original_name":"Ilana Tsur","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61490d9de5593700299862d1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
