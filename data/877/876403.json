The sentence imposed by justice? Worse than any prison: house by prison where his ex-wife! 5 years and one day he will have to endure under the same roof with his ex, his children and his girlfriend, who was approved for conjugal visits, while the house becomes a battlefield to stay with his love, and of course, with everything your money.
