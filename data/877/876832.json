However, nothing happened as planned. Aurélie, Maxime, Hélène, Emma, or Romain are graduates of Polytechnique, Sciences Po, Centrale or business schools. They have made a radical choice: to give up the future they were promised for a life they consider more compatible with the environmental and societal issues of our time. This film tells their story. For a year, the young director Arthur Gosset, himself a student at Centrale Nantes, followed the journey of six young people, their sometimes difficult decisions, their often painful breaks and their courageous choice to live in accordance with their convictions, whatever the cost. Discover the documentary that tells their story.","popularity":0.2334,"poster_path":"/1QrnJ7DNoWyzR6RNXtnZ89p3Q4z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruptures","video":true,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3243190,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Arthur Gosset","original_name":"Arthur Gosset","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"614ad689d6c300002a486b0e","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt23556790","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":"RupturesLeFilm","instagram_id":"ruptures.lefilm","twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":900,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5tOLnxoYjnCb6MuD0fKvEeDGNUQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1600}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/1QrnJ7DNoWyzR6RNXtnZ89p3Q4z.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1200,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dTqRQrA3R0PtMQaTSqJmGP3VhW9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":900}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2210,"name":"climate change"},{"id":15174,"name":"ecology"},{"id":33577,"name":"environment"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2021-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"fr","note":"","release_date":"2022-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
