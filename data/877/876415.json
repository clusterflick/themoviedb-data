Keenly critical of his country’s authoritarian leadership, he sees his work as a form of protest revealing the forces shaping Chinese society and the lives of its citizens. Inspired by the endurance-testing videos of artists like Andy Warhol and Bruce Nauman, Zhang uses mundane, repetitive actions and scenes to demonstrate the absurdity and destructiveness of ritualized behavior and social norms. 30 x 30 (1988), his first video work, is an intentionally excruciating three-hour loop of a pair of gloved hands shattering a mirror, then piecing it back together—an acerbic critique of the rage for watching television, yet another form of thought-control in China.","popularity":0.0495,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"30 x 30","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3241593,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhang Peili","original_name":"Zhang Peili","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6148f4c92dffd80045cc5739","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1988-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
