Here’s his brilliant idea: kidnap the dogs of the rich, who those to get them back are willing to pay any amount of money. The abductee’s name is Palla di Pelo, a beautiful Welsh Corgi who lives as if he were the Ferragnez’s son in the mansion of designer Paki Furlan, a haughty homosexual who treats the dog as if it were his own son. Vincenzo, is together with the only accomplice he can afford: his son Alfredo, whom he treats like a dog instead. They prepare the ransom letter, as in the movies: letters taken from the newspaper, no sender. The designer, as per the request of the mysterious kidnappers, shows up at the appointment with the fifty thousand euros in cash. Happy ending for everyone? Not at all, because we know very well that the most beastly beings are precisely men.","popularity":0.2469,"poster_path":"/64sR5hLSCrm5C8OnXXN6AKGwRH8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Palla
