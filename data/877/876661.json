Brutal suppression of the peaceful protests resulted in more massive marches. Yet, the peaceful protests, having lasted for several months, did not achieve Alexander Lukashenko’s resignation from the president’s post he’s been holding for 27 years. Instead, political repressions in Belarus increased dramatically and became the largest in the history of Europe since the 1970s. The documentary focuses on the lives of Belarusian families who try to continue living and carry on despite being traumatised. Looking at their lives, we can see the pain and hope, feel the fear and determination of these people. An extraordinarily moving film from a Belarusian director living in Poland.","popularity":0.1266,"poster_path":"/w3JLoL6Tm1cUaRD8DaaduFeLU07.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117526,"logo_path":"/iKueQHLIkBg9NsBHV09z2srKu2B.png","name":"Belsat TV","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":117713,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Sonica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2021-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Belarusian","iso_639_1":"be","name":"беларуская мова"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Flowers Are Not Silent","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","title":"Kad ziedi neklusē","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Когда цветы не молчат","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2265202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrei Kutsila","original_name":"Andrei Kutsila","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bbaJkoIWWagwtMV08YtKQjpVHzI.jpg","credit_id":"614a06b21689350064f24d0f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3422590,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Paweł Klepacz","original_name":"Paweł Klepacz","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206f912d7fbda00686b62c5","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2698062,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Beata Krasicka","original_name":"Beata Krasicka","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6206f90beb79c2008f8747e3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2265202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrei Kutsila","original_name":"Andrei Kutsila","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bbaJkoIWWagwtMV08YtKQjpVHzI.jpg","credit_id":"6206f8fbdb154f00a0851b8d","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2265202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrei Kutsila","original_name":"Andrei Kutsila","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bbaJkoIWWagwtMV08YtKQjpVHzI.jpg","credit_id":"6206f900cb8028009cffca3a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2265202,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrei Kutsila","original_name":"Andrei Kutsila","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/bbaJkoIWWagwtMV08YtKQjpVHzI.jpg","credit_id":"6206f91b01432500679d9e7c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt15496244","wikidata_id":"Q109330035","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/wQRYCf5LR5Q7pDAspPmrWFQLokm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.701,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/w3JLoL6Tm1cUaRD8DaaduFeLU07.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":526}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Warsaw Film Festival","release_date":"2021-10-09T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"When Flowers Are Not Silet / trailer / 25th Ji.hlava IDFF","key":"DMoZem_nnMY","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2021-10-24T19:22:30.000Z","id":"618045c4e93e95002b36de45"}]}}}
