This 23 minute portrait is a humorous exploration of the store, its diverse staff and the wild array of customers who frequent its shelves. Filmed in a handheld style, the documentary captures the caffeinated energy that has driven this store for the last 25 years. A whirlwind of activity, Bolerium Books is dedicated to preserving the history of the world's social movements. They house the largest collections of Gay & Lesbian, Chicano and Spanish Civil War materials in the United States. Trotskyism is the fastest selling section in the store, but they have also sold thousands of Gay Pulp novels and Black Panther posters.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/wsTLFGabKupQi8h5vPgOELjnM5E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bolerium","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3240412,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Keary Kensinger","original_name":"Keary Kensinger","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6147a439048638002ce929a0","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1054567","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wsTLFGabKupQi8h5vPgOELjnM5E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":530}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2006-05-19T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
