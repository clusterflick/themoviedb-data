Then imagine never talking about it with anyone. This sets the stage for the documentary film 3 Days 2 Nights. In 1974, Mark and Andy Godfrey went on a family ski vacation to Aspen, Colorado. Tragically, the plane they were traveling on crashed. The world, as they knew it, was changed forever. Mark and Andy, who were 11 and 8, survived 3 days and 2 nights in the frigid mountains of Colorado. For nearly 40 years they rarely discussed the crash even between themselves. This is a film about two brothers coming to grips with the defining moment of their lives. Their story is one of cathartic discovery in hopes of reconciling such a tragedy. It's about how the twin beacons of love and family can help overcome even the greatest of losses.","popularity":0.3974,"poster_path":"/wKVXVIUARCEH4MuEw9eJt0j1pYB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161231,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inverness Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3 Days 2 Nights","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3240923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew Godfrey","original_name":"Andrew Godfrey","popularity":0.0352,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61485cd49450fe00431db387","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3240924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Godfrey","original_name":"Mark Godfrey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61485ce3bf77440025e20374","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3240930,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Godfrey Eaton","original_name":"Paula Godfrey Eaton","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Self","credit_id":"61485e55e5593700431b1d1b","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3240922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Breen","original_name":"John Breen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61485cb3a6ddcb002c080bc2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3240922,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Breen","original_name":"John Breen","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61485cc2daf57c008ac0adb3","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1053123,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jojo Pennebaker","original_name":"Jojo Pennebaker","popularity":0.0557,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61485e062b531d00293d2b75","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":103477,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Shannon Kennedy","original_name":"Shannon Kennedy","popularity":0.0505,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61485e1e2b531d00624c4e2c","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt7634196","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5bMZDSLWhxcFvi7AHovbFx8uFmx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/cuYCX9mqk29tMobxuosOiuRNnpk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[{"aspect_ratio":1.732,"height":310,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jGrgJulbHXvfV5YEPN4I5fBk3a6.png","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":537}],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/wKVXVIUARCEH4MuEw9eJt0j1pYB.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.656,"height":1525,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/hMG9xJUg5pjVJjlefHQNwDUFAO0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.656,"height":1525,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xACOYV5tZLCWvluG3Rpp1tXJHKC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":18035,"name":"family"},{"id":167584,"name":"aspen colorado"},{"id":249530,"name":"plane crash"},{"id":262325,"name":"brothers"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2019-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
