Steeped in archival footage capturing a 1980s Chicago rife with corruption and discrimination, Punch 9 features candid interviews with Jessie Jackson, Vice Mayor Richard Mell, and others on the frontlines and in the backrooms of power as it follows the charismatic politician’s shrewd maneuverings, stinging betrayals, and unlikely victories. Inspiring and compelling, Washington’s journey continues to resonate for a city and nation confronting the same enduring social issues.","popularity":0.4251,"poster_path":"/ndOIP7lfohhG0CraRtq7f3XrcSu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161258,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tallgrass Educational Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Punch 9 for Harold Washington","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3241342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harold Washington","original_name":"Harold Washington","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"6148b57d04863800618c90c6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1538611,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Valerie Jarrett","original_name":"Valerie Jarrett","popularity":0.1448,"profile_path":"/1pmnCG5IBggdIfsmf92iuhqlvjf.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"","credit_id":"6148b5862b531d008d897585","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258041,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Axelrod","original_name":"David Axelrod","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/ijzFHnUMpK93kGKBKZkEg4H5EKW.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"","credit_id":"6148b58e2b531d00293da386","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89289,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesse Jackson","original_name":"Jesse Jackson","popularity":0.2679,"profile_path":"/nVRZPBG8DqvTmSa6M2ptTNZSiTO.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"","credit_id":"6148b594e559370089e91a00","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3241338,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Sonya Jackson","original_name":"Sonya Jackson","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6148b53aa6ddcb002c087796","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1069695,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Raymond C.
