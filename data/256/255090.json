With this in mind, the priest is invited to give a religious service in the state prison of Guatemala City, where he meets Beto, a young fisherman accused of killing a thirteen-year-old girl. The priest sees in Beto a chance to redeem himself and once Beto is released from prison, the priest decides to help him. The priest gives Beto job and shelter in the church, causing his family and congregation to turn against him. Convinced of Beto's innocence and affirmed only in his faith, the priest decides to help him at all costs. Until one day, an unexpected crime occurs in the surroundings of the church.","popularity":0.0721,"poster_path":"/uyMmqvponyDoqKUOZg30zmVAt7d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"GT","name":"Guatemala"}],"release_date":"2011-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fe","video":false,"vote_average":6.667,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":965369,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Morales","original_name":"Jimmy Morales","popularity":0.0561,"profile_path":"/vV0GERH4nU6wqS5txfzqjGXLLxM.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4edd9251416c9114075b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292354,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Josué Otzoy","original_name":"Josué Otzoy","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4edd9251416c9114075f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amabilia Álvarez","original_name":"Amabilia Álvarez","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4edd9251416c91140763","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejo Crisóstomo","original_name":"Alejo Crisóstomo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4edd9251416c91140769","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292356,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alejo Crisóstomo","original_name":"Alejo Crisóstomo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"58bcff14c3a36866a5045f65","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":572115,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ray Figueroa","original_name":"Ray Figueroa","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/9StG8ZkTvFWpKXRDuwRcdCBJO9w.jpg","credit_id":"58bcff26925141609e047ca3","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":572115,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ray Figueroa","original_name":"Ray Figueroa","popularity":0.0454,"profile_path":"/9StG8ZkTvFWpKXRDuwRcdCBJO9w.jpg","credit_id":"673df12a8e357a2ded959814","department":"Directing","job":"First Assistant Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2101353","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1164,"iso_639_1":"es","file_path":"/uyMmqvponyDoqKUOZg30zmVAt7d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":776}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2011-11-24T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
