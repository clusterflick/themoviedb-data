Along the way, his car breaks down and a girl walking along the highway asks for a lift. It turns out she's a nice girl, named Perry, running away from a job at a gasoline station. Soon they're off to New York together, but part ways once they arrive. Time passes and Eddie is failing to sell his play; Perry is failing to find a job. Odd circumstances, involving an old pickpocket named Mandy, bring them together again.","popularity":1.6615,"poster_path":"/oHuEdxRlsOrlyZZebzVXPgs4Dyp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20080,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robert S.
