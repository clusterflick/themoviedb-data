By compositing TV and reducing it to a kind of tic-ridden babble, they force television to not make sense. While this disruption is playful, it also reveals an overall 'essence' of mass culture that would not be apprehended otherwise. Videos such as Stuffing, Ashley, and Lightfoot Fever upset the hypnotic spectacle of TV viewing, revealing how advertising creates anxiety, how culture constructs \"nature\" and how conventional morality is dictated through seemingly neutral images. By forcing television to convulse like a raving lunatic, we might finally hear what it is actually saying.","popularity":0.339,"poster_path":"/dEWmcTZPGjUPSvN8voK6gxYUVKV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Animal Charm: Golden Digest","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Golden Digest","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jimmy Smits","original_name":"Jimmy Smits","popularity":1.3451,"profile_path":"/xaqFevZoQdtfMUQf4qHB2ATPO7S.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Himself (Archival Footage)","credit_id":"52fea98fc3a3680f1e02732b","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":73959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gordon Lightfoot","original_name":"Gordon Lightfoot","popularity":0.1631,"profile_path":"/dhMIcT2Kaj2YdITPQOdTQUEPGXh.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Himself (archival footage)","credit_id":"58171f75c3a36875f6018d92","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292733,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Rich Bott","original_name":"Rich Bott","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fea8e8c3a3680f2501b283","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292734,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jim Fetterley","original_name":"Jim Fetterley","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fea8fbc3a3680f010209a3","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292735,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rich Bott","original_name":"Rich Bott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fea915c3a3680f01020c33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292734,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jim Fetterley","original_name":"Jim Fetterley","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fea922c3a3680ef30189aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292734,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jim Fetterley","original_name":"Jim Fetterley","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fea946c3a3680f17037fea","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292735,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rich Bott","original_name":"Rich Bott","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ce62e870e0a265cdecd974f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1606593","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ckJEMNQz4Y34ERtmzH8to1Fgds5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1333,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/dEWmcTZPGjUPSvN8voK6gxYUVKV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000},{"aspect_ratio":0.715,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/usyqqst5YIBwNuUbz4GIkSGAY4m.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1073}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7507,"name":"collage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1996-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Animal Charm's Golden Digest","key":"nyANlcd76d8","published_at":"2011-03-29T23:15:58.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"id":"533ec72bc3a368544800bd9a"}]}}}
