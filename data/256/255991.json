She is compliant, which makes her an easy target for men. She's religious, believing she is God's favorite child; she searches for Jesus. She has sent a letter to a filmmaker suggesting her life as the subject for a movie. We see her raped then take up with a series of men she believes are Jesus, each willing or insistent on sex. A young man with his own crisis of faith invites her to join a cult. We see her involuntarily committed to an asylum from time to time where medication and constraints await. Her wealthy parents are helpless. Will a medical professional ever talk to her? If one did, would it help?","popularity":0.1467,"poster_path":"/rLdS6hfuAN9i9CQxISUiM8mNheX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58471,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mainline","origin_country":""},{"id":45988,"logo_path":null,"name":"Helma
