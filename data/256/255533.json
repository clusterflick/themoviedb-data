Wild rumours began circulating on the Internet that he’d been abducted by Al-Qaeda or aliens from outer space. Some Twitter users even expressed relief that the controversial author was suddenly no longer around. This film now reveals what really happened: Three tough guys variously with impressive hairstyles and bodybuilder physiques carried off the star intellectual, taking him out of the daily stress of dodging autograph hunters and having his flat renovated and bringing him to a beautiful rural underdog idyll, full of dog grooming, bodybuilding demonstrations, junk cars and Polish sausages. But who was to pay the ransom?","popularity":0.4031,"poster_path":"/3Liu58WXxqNaY58oThNrmd8IlgK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7395,"logo_path":"/cGOGYYfbJZ1uJHynRIf8yj4phRn.png","name":"Les films
