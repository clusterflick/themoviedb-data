Borders is about men and women dreaming of a better life in Europe and the high price they often have to pay for it - if they succeed at all. Without taking an immediate moral stance, the film follows the route that many immigrants take from the heart of Africa to the centre of Europe, stopping at each border: Nigeria, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal , Mauritania, Morocco, Spain, France, Belgium, and finally, the Netherlands.","popularity":0.3343,"poster_path":"/uK0KxCqmrRs57P6z4lODeCjIprv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19962,"logo_path":"/ppbBv0isUhxiI1UABAn89lIUhn6.png","name":"Pieter van Huystee Film & TV","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2014-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Borders","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1291816,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacqueline van Vugt","original_name":"Jacqueline van Vugt","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/zA2FIz2zknILPeESTYpktHtMNIn.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4edb9251416c911402c5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1291816,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacqueline van Vugt","original_name":"Jacqueline van Vugt","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/zA2FIz2zknILPeESTYpktHtMNIn.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4edb9251416c911402cb","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291819,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Hens van Rooij","original_name":"Hens van Rooij","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4edb9251416c911402d1","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291820,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Bouwe Mulder","original_name":"Bouwe Mulder","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4edb9251416c911402d7","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1291821,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pieter van Huystee jr.","original_name":"Pieter van Huystee jr.","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4edb9251416c911402dd","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":569911,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Ranko Pauković","original_name":"Ranko Pauković","popularity":0.0546,"profile_path":"/xUNnKLyrJUfNcyfAr15y7ARoAWH.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4edb9251416c911402e3","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291822,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Barbara Hin","original_name":"Barbara Hin","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4edb9251416c911402e9","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291823,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Natascha Teunissen","original_name":"Natascha Teunissen","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4edc9251416c911402ef","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1291824,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Constant van Panhuys","original_name":"Constant van Panhuys","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4edc9251416c911402f5","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1291816,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jacqueline van Vugt","original_name":"Jacqueline van Vugt","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":"/zA2FIz2zknILPeESTYpktHtMNIn.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4edc9251416c911402fb","department":"Production","job":"Line Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1185251,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Pieter van Huystee","original_name":"Pieter van Huystee","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4edc9251416c91140301","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3753390","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2835,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uK0KxCqmrRs57P6z4lODeCjIprv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1890}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":2286,"name":"border"},{"id":6420,"name":"border crossing"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2014-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"BORDERS Trailer","key":"-mGPnqj-aQw","published_at":"2013-11-19T12:07:46.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":720,"type":"Trailer","official":true,"id":"533ec72bc3a368544800bd53"}]}}}
