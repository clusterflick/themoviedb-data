The (very few) action scenes are a complete mess. The film is basically an over-the-top melodrama and makes very little sense. I was too frustrated to even enjoy the beauty of Cheryl Yang and Annie Wu.","popularity":0.2593,"poster_path":"/cyt29qfzDtWN5Qg1XKEkFtVAF5Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"West Town Girls","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"West Town Girls","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":120419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Wu","original_name":"Annie Wu","popularity":0.558,"profile_path":"/dy2oh3nXPXWLHEoSoaLYTchJxAR.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Porsch","credit_id":"5a8041070e0a262aae01e52e","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1247111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cheryl Yang","original_name":"楊謹華","popularity":0.8048,"profile_path":"/mqk1S0i5eMJ3tGuNAFT6RtKgSQb.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Gucci","credit_id":"5a80410c0e0a262ab201ef7b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":555377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shu-shen Hsiao","original_name":"Shu-shen Hsiao","popularity":0.5061,"profile_path":"/fTd3jcJS97lN6t09rntalEJI9S8.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Pigeon (as Liliy Hsiao)","credit_id":"5a804119925141410401c18a","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1976162,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yi-Fei Chen","original_name":"Yi-Fei Chen","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Captain Lee Chun Kwon","credit_id":"5a804124c3a36818ac01b3e5","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1258376,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Dou","original_name":"竇智孔","popularity":0.2612,"profile_path":"/bxNEQM7KN9ImUxwcbu0gOdSN48m.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Star","credit_id":"5a80beadc3a36818950257f0","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1976416,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Tseng","original_name":"Alvin Tseng","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Ya Yang","credit_id":"5a80beb9925141410a023bb6","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1976418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shih-Lun Kuo","original_name":"Shih-Lun Kuo","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":"/zDDbFjWlPZuAeY6SLXO5Z9udbvO.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Pao","credit_id":"5a80bed50e0a262aa60274b3","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1976127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"May Liu","original_name":"May Liu","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Solio","credit_id":"5a80bee80e0a262aa2026da3","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1976419,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gigi Lin","original_name":"Gigi Lin","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Gigi","credit_id":"5a80bf2e0e0a262aa002728d","order":8},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1976420,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tien-Fa Kao","original_name":"Tien-Fa Kao","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":11,"character":"Pigeon's Dad","credit_id":"5a80bf42c3a36818a7026f1b","order":9},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1261029,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xiao Pan Pan","original_name":"小潘潘","popularity":0.1936,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Cheung Lai Wah","credit_id":"5a80bf600e0a262ab5026b60","order":10},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1976423,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Huang","original_name":"Anne Huang","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":13,"character":"Little Pigeon","credit_id":"5a80bf6ec3a36818cd023801","order":11}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1712840,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alice Wang Yu Ya","original_name":"Alice Wang","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8040ea925141410101c950","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1712840,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alice Wang Yu Ya","original_name":"Alice Wang","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5a8040e6c3a36818cd01bdb7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0788246","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cyt29qfzDtWN5Qg1XKEkFtVAF5Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
