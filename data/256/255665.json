It also features critical commentary on his intense and ground-breaking conceptualist practice from three of North America’s leading voices on avant-garde poetics. Shot on location in New York in 2007, the lively conversations featured in sucking on words are an ideal introduction to Goldsmith’s witty and provocative works, which are already regarded as hallmarks of 21st-century literature. The film showcases readings from some of his notorious books: No.111 (found phrases ending in the ‘r’ rhyme and filtered alphabetically by syllable count); Soliloquy (a transcription of every word Goldsmith spoke for a week); Day (a retyping of one day’s New York Times newspaper); Traffic (one day’s worth of hourly radio traffic bulletins); and The Weather (one year’s worth of radio weather bulletins).","popularity":0.0712,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20058,"logo_path":null,"name":"information as material","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"conceptual writing - a fusion of art and literature","title":"sucking on words","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292832,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Kenneth Goldsmith","original_name":"Kenneth Goldsmith","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fef7739251417cdf0bede9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292833,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Fitterman","original_name":"Robert Fitterman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fef7919251417359083fdb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":96991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barbara Coles","original_name":"Barbara Coles","popularity":0.1104,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Herself","credit_id":"52fef7a29251417ce20af539","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Andrews","original_name":"Bruce Andrews","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52fef7b79251417ce50b64af","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292842,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christine Morris","original_name":"Christine Morris","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fef86e9251417ce50b71bd","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292838,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jarrod Fowler","original_name":"Jarrod Fowler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fef8259251417cd60c5ef2","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292837,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Jarrod Fowler","original_name":"Jarrod Fowler","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fef81c9251417ce20afdcc","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292835,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Fiona Biggiero","original_name":"Fiona Biggiero","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fef7f192514173560737f6","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292840,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Jerome Harmann-Hardeman","original_name":"Jerome Harmann-Hardeman","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fef8419251417ce20b011a","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Technician"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292836,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Fiona Biggiero","original_name":"Fiona Biggiero","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fef8079251417cd90bb9d5","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1292841,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Simon Morris","original_name":"Simon Morris","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fef8559251417356073de7","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292843,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rob Lavers","original_name":"Rob Lavers","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fef8869251417356073f04","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1292839,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jerome Harmann-Hardeman","original_name":"Jerome Harmann-Hardeman","popularity":0.045,"profile_path":"/19A9fe2b5IUrxpxVHhHQzJcRIe2.jpg","credit_id":"52fef8389251417cd90bc89e","department":"Crew","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":496,"name":"poetry"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
