Without any previous research, characters, locations or established themes, a film crew arrives at the Paraiba backlands in search of people with stories to tell. In the town of São João do Rio Peixe, they discover the Araçás Farm, a rural community where 86 families live, the majority connected by family ties. Thanks to the mediation of a young woman from Araçás, the residents – consisting mostly of elderly people – tell their life stories, marked by popular Catholicism, hierarchy, a sense of family and honor. A world on the verge of disappearing.","popularity":0.1221,"poster_path":"/bSvBiQ6GwxFgwE9gcE0Hxio1Gk7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":346,"logo_path":"/ymwuRMQkrQojx55MeMO861Rdecz.png","name":"VideoFilmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2006-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Fim e o Princípio","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo Coutinho","original_name":"Eduardo Coutinho","popularity":0.1476,"profile_path":"/jMTB1VYoRe0aYq13hfgyZz19gpZ.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ef29251416c91143257","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1146986,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jordana Berg","original_name":"Jordana Berg","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":"/9WS1PuV87bYdmB2S3RNYHkzxoec.jpg","credit_id":"5b0fd6dc9251415e97004501","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":933169,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"João Moreira Salles","original_name":"João Moreira Salles","popularity":0.0602,"profile_path":"/w2NRw12fFtvaDai4EfilZ84UToA.jpg","credit_id":"5b0ff09f0e0a2630920066f0","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":932971,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eduardo Coutinho","original_name":"Eduardo Coutinho","popularity":0.1476,"profile_path":"/jMTB1VYoRe0aYq13hfgyZz19gpZ.jpg","credit_id":"5d4e1dfc0d5d8500123de36a","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8563,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Mauricio Andrade Ramos","original_name":"Mauricio Andrade Ramos","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d4e1e0d7c6de32abca4e130","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":592442,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Jacques Cheuiche","original_name":"Jacques Cheuiche","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"66e400260000000000b985bd","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0796979","wikidata_id":"Q10339154","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yXM6MgiD4YFtbpPRHOLCWIqcsl2.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/LnHkJcEejq2gLCQoQjO4kRTena.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":993,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/bSvBiQ6GwxFgwE9gcE0Hxio1Gk7.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":3,"width":662},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"pt","file_path":"/zzqVUSVcyeRPEHQwTEfFEFJgADS.jpg","vote_average":1.75,"vote_count":2,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Mar del Plata Film Festival","release_date":"2006-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
