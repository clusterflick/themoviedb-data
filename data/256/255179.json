At the core of progressive snowboarding, it is movement and reward that provide a natural motivation for riders like Bode Merrill, Victor De Le Rue, and Brandon Cocard to evolve and innovate. These explorers of mountain and mental landscapes led the charge this year, changing the definition of what can be done on a snowboard, and changing the guard. From the Yukon, Kootenays, Valhallas, Monashees, Dolomites, and Pyrenees, the Absinthe crew proves Dopamine is free, but you have to get out there to earn it.","popularity":0.1098,"poster_path":"/kqjZECLZxa9dNIE5JvTkjtlUmfm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2758,"logo_path":"/7FmWAdPdIF2DOeyyLaeoaCNE46G.png","name":"Absinthe
