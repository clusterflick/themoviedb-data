His overly astute hearing drives him into the woods and away from the cacophony of the town's hustle and bustle. Once in the woods, he meets a kindly old hermit who teaches him how to play the violin he made. After the old man dies, the violin ends up at a pawn shop, and each night the boy sneaks in to play it in secret. It is this haunting, nightly music that sets the town on edge -- people think an evil spirit is on the loose.","popularity":0.1328,"poster_path":"/1UkfkZ5xb6MQ8T7oCJbD99ChYD3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18526,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producciones Yanco","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1961-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yanco","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1718406,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ricardo Ancona","original_name":"Ricardo Ancona","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Juanito","credit_id":"5844add7c3a368472200e863","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1718407,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jesús Medina","original_name":"Jesús Medina","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Old Man","credit_id":"5844addf9251416a8000ec04","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1718408,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"María Bustamante","original_name":"María Bustamante","popularity":0.0281,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"Maria","credit_id":"5844adea9251416ae800e710","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99979,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Servando González","original_name":"Servando González","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/c8ufdtKNQ24Ml7CoSnigeAmCD21.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4ef39251416c911435a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1020068,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Álex Phillips Jr.","original_name":"Álex Phillips Jr.","popularity":0.1525,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5844adbc925141676400ec28","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31218,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Gustavo César Carrión","original_name":"Gustavo César Carrión","popularity":0.0984,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5844adb092514166ba00e4b7","department":"Sound","job":"Original Music Composer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140100,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fernando Martínez","original_name":"Fernando Martínez","popularity":0.0729,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5844adc4c3a368478d00ef90","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":99979,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Servando González","original_name":"Servando González","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/c8ufdtKNQ24Ml7CoSnigeAmCD21.jpg","credit_id":"5b9c178e925141282e00105f","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1087194,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jesús Marín","original_name":"Jesús Marín","popularity":0.1182,"profile_path":"/4GuuEk3V695PEUtzf6vcN5Nus4D.jpg","credit_id":"5b9c1785925141282700111c","department":"Writing","job":"Screenplay"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0249259","wikidata_id":"Q126000032","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A1gsKl64HgDhYr4Bv4RCJKtfXQF.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/jcnFOJycbKS23J073aIFxETUAAy.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/7QgYYjci4U8uA4ANlNukVQFRsdi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/8HjFLb26VeDUPWjwu1r5AFJ9NFr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/rUDuu7qLkU0FvqgnWfLzuuQq93R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1107,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1UkfkZ5xb6MQ8T7oCJbD99ChYD3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":738},{"aspect_ratio":0.665,"height":960,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/ysGxo39694E8RKhVW7FamCp3Sj5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":638},{"aspect_ratio":0.668,"height":756,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cOCMreUrjVCmQa3pXRxuiatXIBn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":505},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4CefmboDOmAdkIjwDaIjqHYclBu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1961-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1965-01-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
