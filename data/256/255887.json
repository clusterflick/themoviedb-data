Tuareg Electric Guitar trance rock, Bori cult dance ceremonies, Fulani Folk, and Roadhouse Gospel Rave-ups are some of the segments included in this latest \"Folk Cinema\" classic from Sublime Frequencies! Filmed in December of 2004 on location in Niger, Hisham Mayet delivers a spontaneous, raw, and inspiring collection of images, music, and ceremony (again with a single camera presentation) from a nation mired in poverty and continual post-colonial disappointment. Quoting from Mayet’s liner notes: \"This is not music as commodity, this is music as survival. There is a saying in Niger that goes, \"when we die we know we are going to heaven because we already live in Hell\" well I think its more like the purgatory that we all live in and they sure have managed to transcend with an incredible natural resource: Music. Dig it!\"","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/oby2epuvjla3AnE5Aa4H55gOTqc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sublime Frequencies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NE","name":"Niger"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Niger: Magic and Ecstasy in the Sahel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ouragan Del Air","original_name":"Ouragan Del Air","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"5300fd65c3a3680a03038cd9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293387,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mohamed Tenna","original_name":"Mohamed Tenna","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"5300fda7c3a3680a0904027d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293388,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Abdou Yahaya","original_name":"Abdou Yahaya","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"5300fdc8c3a3680a2e04732f","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1293389,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Boubon Griots","original_name":"Boubon Griots","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Performer","credit_id":"5300fdf2c3a3680a110439ba","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1204999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hisham Mayet","original_name":"Hisham Mayet","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5300fbe6c3a3680a0903b535","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1204999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hisham Mayet","original_name":"Hisham Mayet","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5300fc75c3a36809fd047502","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1204999,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hisham Mayet","original_name":"Hisham Mayet","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5300fbf6c3a3680a2e0405e8","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.719,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/oby2epuvjla3AnE5Aa4H55gOTqc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":719}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"NIGER: Magic and Ecstasy in the Sahel (cut)","key":"sfB1NxM0ClU","published_at":"2012-09-10T00:11:38.000Z","site":"YouTube","size":360,"type":"Clip","official":false,"id":"533ec72bc3a368544800bdc7"}]}}}
