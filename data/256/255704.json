The film is uniquely told by 5 directors who each direct each of these events as segments of the film, combining together to make one full narrative in a variety of different styles - ranging from drama and comedy to noir and mockumentary - making CUAK a truly Malaysian movie with themes that resonate with a universal audience regardless of race or religion.","popularity":0.1686,"poster_path":"/jYE1oBJ4Hi3Hb98TT1Xx4JaJa2m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2014-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cuak","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1292957,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ghafir Akbar","original_name":"Ghafir Akbar","popularity":0.0306,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Adam","credit_id":"52ff5e25c3a3680f011aae61","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292958,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dawn Cheong","original_name":"Dawn Cheong","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Brenda","credit_id":"52ff5e35c3a3680f25190c3f","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1188300,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Eusoff","original_name":"Tony Eusoff","popularity":0.2653,"profile_path":"/wV2RB6ZVPCCLmRFWTS2FAl6unGd.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Mikail","credit_id":"52ff5e43c3a3680f08195c18","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1202813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Iedil Putra","original_name":"Iedil Putra","popularity":0.3222,"profile_path":"/q2JMKvjXlWjFr0xi2Hl5YjwmpSw.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Zul","credit_id":"52ff5e5ac3a3680ef317429c","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marina Tan","original_name":"Marina Tan","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":9,"character":"Nina","credit_id":"52ff5e68c3a3680f08195db1","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292960,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ani Juliana Ibrahim","original_name":"Ani Juliana Ibrahim","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":10,"character":"Nurul","credit_id":"52ff5e7fc3a3680f171b6d1b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1292961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amelia Chen","original_name":"Amelia Chen","popularity":0.0804,"profile_path":"/cZCGKSp0Z1aD9TbHkZLdXG0RIWk.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"Vicky","credit_id":"52ff5ea5c3a3680f1e19f3f3","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292962,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Priya Kulasagaran","original_name":"Priya Kulasagaran","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52ff5f12c3a3680f1e19ffae","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292954,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Manesh Nesaratnam","original_name":"Manesh Nesaratnam","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52ff5dfcc3a3680f1019cb67","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292956,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Pietra","original_name":"Tony Pietra","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52ff5e0dc3a3680f1019cbd2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292950,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Khairil M.
