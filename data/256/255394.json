Aron has his bed placed by the window, and with the hope to bring a spark of light into their isolated world, he spends the days describing the course of events out on the street to his friend, who has a more bitter approach to their situation. But what starts out as an innocent game, eventually becomes a matter of life and death in a way that none of them could have imagined.","popularity":0.0784,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Placebo","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2638829,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mathæus Andersen","original_name":"Mathæus Andersen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/bDmaXQtr2EawLMullUx1Di3aB5s.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Theo","credit_id":"5ebdab4e8e2e00002012f219","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638830,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Malthe Vrå Heldbo","original_name":"Malthe Vrå Heldbo","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Aron","credit_id":"5ebdab551283e90020cbfa9e","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Inger Larsen","original_name":"Inger Larsen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Sygeplejerske","credit_id":"5ebdab648586780021e56ca3","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638832,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sandra Møller","original_name":"Sandra Møller","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"Pigen","credit_id":"5ebdab6fbc8abc0021c23365","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2638834,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linda Ottesen","original_name":"Linda Ottesen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"Sygeplejerske","credit_id":"5ebdab778e2e00001f11dce6","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292266,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Johanna Stentorp","original_name":"Johanna Stentorp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4ee89251416c91141e7f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292266,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Johanna Stentorp","original_name":"Johanna Stentorp","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"531b9b0292514177b7004496","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3226160","wikidata_id":"Q33558999","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
