After suffering a nervous breakdown, her husband, a used car salesman, is revitalized when he travels back in time to drive the first car he ever sold. Seventeen years later a powerful canned food manufacturer crashes the same car into a toaster truck while endorsing a brand of yams on live TV. At the funeral his clergyman experiences a crisis of faith when he and a lifelike Mexican continue their search for a married couple who have befriended an insect who enjoys drinking lime soda. They later meet a young man whose bizarre murder scheme involves four innocent members of an experimental rock band who have all given up smoking.","popularity":0.1752,"poster_path":"/qegz1NSQXiFcyATzl8eQEadKyyi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Negativland: No Other Possibility","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Grigg","original_name":"Chris Grigg","popularity":0.0286,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52feb17e9251417cd303e9b6","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292739,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Hosler","original_name":"Mark Hosler","popularity":0.0264,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52feb18e9251417ce5027bdd","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292740,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Joyce","original_name":"Don Joyce","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52feb19f9251417cea024ff1","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292741,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Lyons","original_name":"Richard Lyons","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52feb1c29251417cea02508a","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1292742,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David 'Weatherman' Wills","original_name":"David 'Weatherman' Wills","popularity":0.0243,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52feb2099251417ce803120c","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292744,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Negativland","original_name":"Negativland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"606cd5439ca7590029eb43a1","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292743,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Landon Spearman","original_name":"Landon Spearman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52feb489c3a3680ef302d2ac","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1292744,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Negativland","original_name":"Negativland","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52feb49cc3a3680f17050b74","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0380587","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":882,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/qegz1NSQXiFcyATzl8eQEadKyyi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":588}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":7507,"name":"collage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
