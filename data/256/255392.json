As the Second World War was coming to a close, the US Office of Strategic Services trained and parachuted two Jewish refugees and a German deserter deep into Nazi occupied Austria. Through vivid first-person accounts, re-enactments, archival footage and learned commentary, the film reveals how their efforts disrupted a vital supply route between Germany and the Italian front to bring about the surrender of Innsbruck to Allied Forces. Their unbelievable adventure has a finale that beats any Hollywood movie hands down — but a story so powerful that it became the basis for Quentin Tarantino’s mega hit.","popularity":0.6811,"poster_path":"/eunqs8kybaElqu2U0XzU3ARCR2r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108883,"logo_path":null,"name":"Storyline Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2012-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Real Inglorious Bastards","video":false,"vote_average":7.9,"vote_count":24,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Los auténticos malditos bastardos","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1010052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Nolan","original_name":"Robert Nolan","popularity":0.0462,"profile_path":"/y2uOHGl2bJwr7vqE0xXclZrDmRB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Narrator","credit_id":"618d83829a8a8a0043515d6d","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486903,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Min Sook Lee","original_name":"Min Sook Lee","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618d8321d768fe002b826cf6","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1486903,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Min Sook Lee","original_name":"Min Sook Lee","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618d833920e6a500918c7756","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt3320110","wikidata_id":"Q122740677","facebook_id":"realinglorious","instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/3TwEeabXL7HbgaWsL0ewtPxIYoo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/eunqs8kybaElqu2U0XzU3ARCR2r.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1067},{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1600,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/rQmG9VYGBYzPsaVq7xdY3j5iVXg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"14A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2012-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
