They are said to possess the power to assist or devastate the lives of those who recognize them. A PWE is a ceremony held to appease a Nat.  Pwes are arranged daily throughout Burma for many purposes including the achievement of success in business, a happy marriage, or improving one's health. A Nat is summoned through a Kadaw; the flamboyant and charismatic master of the Pwe dressed in elegant costume. The Kadaw is a spirit medium, dancer, storyteller, and magician who exposes the crowd to a living incarnation of the Nat brought forth through opening ritual and careful observance of tradition.","popularity":0.2439,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sublime Frequencies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MM","name":"Myanmar"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nat Pwe: Burma's Carnival of Spirit Soul","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1254763,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Bishop","original_name":"Richard Bishop","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"53011541c3a3680a2108f8e8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1254763,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Bishop","original_name":"Richard Bishop","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5301158fc3a3680a3707f576","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":996444,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alan Bishop","original_name":"Alan Bishop","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530115b3c3a3680a2e093a24","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1254762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Millis","original_name":"Robert Millis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530115cac3a3680a3f08ea09","department":"Camera","job":"Camera Operator"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1254763,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Richard Bishop","original_name":"Richard Bishop","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530115ebc3a3680a0908b711","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1254762,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Robert Millis","original_name":"Robert Millis","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"530115fdc3a3680a0908b8fb","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"},{"id":6382,"name":"folk music"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
