The video chronicles how the social act of loving women becomes channeled into narratives of incest, desire for the mother, loss of the father, separation from the family, death and self-destruction. In this work, sexuality, difference and language are paralleled with haunting memories of a childhood ghost that both desires and hates women. Finally, Kiss The Boys And Make Them Die is a story of childhood trauma, and the adult need to exorcise the past and create an independent self.","popularity":0.0928,"poster_path":"/kwP6I2y38WbjshXSLMdurbBvYMV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kiss the Boys and Make Them Die","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015967,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margaret Stratton","original_name":"Margaret Stratton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"60543adba1d332009da79f87","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015967,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margaret Stratton","original_name":"Margaret Stratton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61070135e61e6d007548d134","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2975648,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Henke","original_name":"Steven Henke","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61070155308131005f45207a","department":"Editing","job":"Online Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015967,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margaret Stratton","original_name":"Margaret Stratton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61070115f96a390074349a42","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015967,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margaret Stratton","original_name":"Margaret Stratton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6107011c7d5f4b005e8b9ef0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1523590,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Paul Dickinson","original_name":"Paul Dickinson","popularity":0.0687,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61070144e61e6d007548d153","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015967,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Margaret Stratton","original_name":"Margaret Stratton","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"610701249715ae002d31af3e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kwP6I2y38WbjshXSLMdurbBvYMV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
