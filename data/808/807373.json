Teaming up with world-class scientists, they search for biological entities in sewage with potentially lifesaving medical properties, find out how pee can generate electricity, how gas from poo can fuel a car and how nutrients in waste can help solve the soil crisis. They follow each stage of the sewage treatment process, revealing what the stuff we flush can tell us about how we live today, and the mindboggling biotechnology being harnessed to clean it, making the wastewater safe enough to return to the environment.","popularity":0.8725,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":67667,"logo_path":"/d5TsW4Aj8NmQw2n6RaKKWTIEMBI.png","name":"Tern TV","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Secret Science of Sewage","video":false,"vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":224638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George McGavin","original_name":"George McGavin","popularity":0.06,"profile_path":"/zqtbKhDX9umx3iJFj9coJlmBIrt.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self - Presenter","credit_id":"6053d181c433ea007999806c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2406612,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zoe Laughlin","original_name":"Zoe Laughlin","popularity":0.0479,"profile_path":"/bwpevUb0DhHvCHQWyB7JSUTqoAM.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Self - Presenter","credit_id":"6053d465255dba00502af8d5","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1803068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Craig Collinson","original_name":"Craig Collinson","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6053d4919a64c100294fb5de","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1803068,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Craig Collinson","original_name":"Craig Collinson","popularity":0.0256,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6053d4a5eb79c2006a432c74","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015672,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ruth Mulcahy","original_name":"Ruth Mulcahy","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6053d4b4fab3fa0075af9103","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2140868,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Harry Bell","original_name":"Harry Bell","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6053d4cb8cfcc700539e0dad","department":"Production","job":"Executive Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015725,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Christopher Pitbladdo","original_name":"Christopher Pitbladdo","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6053de8cbd990c00a00e882d","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3015727,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cara Maclean","original_name":"Cara Maclean","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6053deabc433ea004f439210","department":"Production","job":"Production Manager"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":2160,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/a6GI262JnRNg3qE9FmUKu60Yev8.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":3840},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5D7E4SMjm7vLDXPAMyq0yHR05Yi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":17980,"name":"green energy"},{"id":158529,"name":"biochemist"},{"id":162356,"name":"mechanical engineering"},{"id":215872,"name":"bacteria"},{"id":257806,"name":"renewable energy"},{"id":257923,"name":"recyclable materials"},{"id":269082,"name":"sewage"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"PG","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"Aired on BBC2 at 9pm","release_date":"2021-03-18T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
