It tells the story of Jim Curtiss, a man now detached from reality. His fantasies and realities are out of connection; he struggles to join his dreamlife with his realife; he goes through a series of adventures which underline his isolation. He is an emblem of the lonely bachelor threading his way though the city. â€“M.
