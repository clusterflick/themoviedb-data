Young men from across the country (some inanely misogynistic and others completely innocent) were slaughtered-strangled, stabbed and even dismembered by the blood-lust of these two mentally deranged siblings. Now in 2016 the killing spree continues-only it isn't the Sicole Sisters responsible for the current murders, but rather their psychopathic followers-a full-fledged cult that has assembled to honor the sisters and their vicious vendetta.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/AeEJn6pnQGizLjLF7Y0KyAJlhMR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cult of the Psycho Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt6192944","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.707,"height":904,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/AeEJn6pnQGizLjLF7Y0KyAJlhMR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":639}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2017-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
