The poetic, fragmented style and structure of the film represent the exile's internal struggle to \"reconstitute\" her own sense of self in relation to her history and ancestry.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GY","name":"Guyana"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coconut/Cane & Cutlass","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2173864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michelle Mohabeer","original_name":"Michelle Mohabeer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6052f40e031a1d004e2fb88c","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1994-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
