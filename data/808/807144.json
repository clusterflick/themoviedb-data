Once a modest program designed to expose rural children to the wonders of music, the system has become one of the most important and beautiful music phenomena in modern history. To Play and To Fight presents interviews and performances by many of the world’s most renowned musicians including the great tenor Placido Domingo, Claudio Abbado, Sir Simon Rattle, Guiseppe Sinopoli, and Eduardo Mata, as they reflect on the impact of such a far-reaching social project. The documentary also presents the inspirational stories of world class musicians who have been trained by the Venezuelan system, including The Berlin Philharmonic’s youngest player Edicson Ruiz and world class conductor Gustavo Dudamel.","popularity":0.2518,"poster_path":"/iAoYK4f0hZGZv4ML40EhBfkTfv8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48065,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema Sur","origin_country":""},{"id":151024,"logo_path":null,"name":"Explorart Films","origin_country":""},{"id":151025,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cines Unidos","origin_country":""},{"id":151026,"logo_path":null,"name":"BintFilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2007-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Only those who dream achieve the impossible.","title":"To Play and to Fight","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1019838,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudio Abbado","original_name":"Claudio Abbado","popularity":0.332,"profile_path":"/v6zf1YHJ3gMAvQ5xmrTYkd4A12.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self -
