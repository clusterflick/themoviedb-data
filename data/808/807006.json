In this piece, the artist continues his search seen in his earlier works for identity and placement in Canada's multicultural and First Nations arena. Longboy outs himself as a First Nations FAG, who is living with HIV and abruptly severs attached preconceptions of two-spirited peoples, forcing the First Nation's community to address him rather than the disease.
