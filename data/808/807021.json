At the battle, Napoleon (Fred Evans) and Wellington (Joe Evans) toss a coin for the first shot. The French, realising they have forgotten the ammunition, go off to the shops to buy some more. A troop of Boy Scouts charge Napoleon, who, after a chaotic battle, surrenders. He is taken prisoner and sent off in a boat, saying goodbye to France forever (here represented by a cardboard notice saying France on one bank of the Thames).  -Bryony Dixon- BFI","popularity":0.0627,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":180654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Folly Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1913-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pimple’s Battle of Waterloo","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","title":"The Adventures of Pimple: The Battle of Waterloo","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":218149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Evans","original_name":"Fred Evans","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1AhiWXg80b5SwF4FvrWFiCY96v7.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Pimple/Napoleon","credit_id":"6056aeb52ac49900756d4afd","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1258331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Evans","original_name":"Joe Evans","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Wellington","credit_id":"6056afba6f6a99003f363ceb","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1258331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Evans","original_name":"Joe Evans","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6056b01122931a006a27b294","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":218149,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Fred Evans","original_name":"Fred Evans","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":"/1AhiWXg80b5SwF4FvrWFiCY96v7.jpg","credit_id":"6056b02f223a8b003e476d5e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1258331,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joe Evans","original_name":"Joe Evans","popularity":0.0363,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6056b0462ac499002acbd9cd","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0231090","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"release date unconfirmed, year is correct","release_date":"1913-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
