It's pleasant enough, and amusing at times, as long as you don't require a plot or expect dimensional characters. If you want basic silent comedy chuckles, you'll get them. Our setting is Bullonia, \"the land of romance, castanets, onions and sweet zephyrs of garlic.\" Actually, it looks rather like a back-lot version of Spain or Latin America. More to the point, the atmosphere suggests the Doug Fairbanks vehicle The Gaucho, which was in general release when this short was made.","popularity":0.1347,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1928-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fandango","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lupino Lane","original_name":"Lupino Lane","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/wFroJOcJqZE8uQQMyaBSc1Zd9se.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"The Lonesomest Man in Town","credit_id":"52fe4c549251416c910f1af7","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1007709,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wallace Lupino","original_name":"Wallace Lupino","popularity":0.0475,"profile_path":"/wuFbVhADjY6AxWqeseEKjBF3YRM.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"A Tough Egg","credit_id":"52fe4c549251416c910f1afb","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":140874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anita Garvin","original_name":"Anita Garvin","popularity":0.1176,"profile_path":"/gOPMlk1i6yhCSZxpqVwIAaW4IS7.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6531f2a39ac535087f3aa664","order":2}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":144518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lupino Lane","original_name":"Lupino Lane","popularity":0.1226,"profile_path":"/wFroJOcJqZE8uQQMyaBSc1Zd9se.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c549251416c910f1af3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0256021","wikidata_id":"Q18713281","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1928-05-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
