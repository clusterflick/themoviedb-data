A revolver is on the opposite side of the table. He pours a glass of whiskey and, with a despairing look, starts to drink it. He changes his mind, grabs the revolver, and places it against his temple, but then changes his mind again and lays the revolver carefully on the table. He drinks the whiskey with a contented smile and thumbs his nose at the audience.","popularity":0.4296,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1902-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Burlesque Suicide, No. 2","video":false,"vote_average":4.909,"vote_count":11,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Burlesque Suicide, no. 2","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074091,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George S.
