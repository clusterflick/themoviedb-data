She first looks at a hanger, which immediately falls from the wall, not being able to stand her gaze. Then she looks at the clock, and her face causes it to fall to the floor with a crash. She then walks over to the mirror, which suddenly cracks in several places. The photographer then poses her. Just as he is to press the button the camera explodes with a great puff of smoke, completely destroying the camera and demolishing the studio. The picture finishes up with the old maid tipping back in her chair and losing her balance, displaying a large quantity of fancy lace goods.","popularity":0.3367,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1901-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Old Maid Having Her Picture Taken","video":false,"vote_average":4.444,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Old Maid Having Her Picture Taken","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1267399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gilbert Saroni","original_name":"Gilbert Saroni","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"The Old Maid","credit_id":"5523df459251414752001bfe","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074091,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George S.
