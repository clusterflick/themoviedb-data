The building has an impressive colonnaded facade, and is located at 181, Santa Catarine St., Porto - one of the city's main streets. A passengers' horse cart crosses from right to left of the screen, and a few seconds after an ox cart carrying merchandise crosses in the opposite direction. All the while, workers keep leaving the factory, giving a sense of a large work force.","popularity":0.0356,"poster_path":"/A2pgEhqwMKwERjjGTPMqaL5H705.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"1896-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Workers Exit from the Confiança Shirt Factory","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","title":"Saída do Pessoal Operário da Camisaria Confiança","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189263,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Kinetographo Portuguez","original_name":"Kinetographo Portuguez","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c679251416c910f3e45","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aurélio da Paz dos Reis","original_name":"Aurélio da Paz dos Reis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c679251416c910f3e33","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1189262,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Francisco Magalhães Bastos Júnior","original_name":"Francisco Magalhães Bastos Júnior","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c679251416c910f3e3f","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171306,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aurélio da Paz dos Reis","original_name":"Aurélio da Paz dos Reis","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c679251416c910f3e39","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0000117","wikidata_id":"Q10368705","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/5Cv0QhKE481MU1IJRrhdvQLO848.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/vT6LToszrGKaqDYertyFYlaA39d.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.7,"height":2000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/A2pgEhqwMKwERjjGTPMqaL5H705.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1896-11-12T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
