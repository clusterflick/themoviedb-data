The film examines the influence the work of Henri Poincare and Alexander Lyapunov had on later developments in mathematics. It includes interviews with David Ruelle, about chaos theory and turbulence, the economist Paul Ormerod about the unpredictability of economic systems, and James Lovelock the founder of Gaia theory about climate change and tipping points in the environment. As we approach tipping points in both the economy and the climate, the film examines the mathematics we have been reluctant to face up to and asks if, even now, we would rather bury our heads in the sand rather than face harsh truths.","popularity":0.0639,"poster_path":"/gjsjtAxLEctZEgxYIAtbXJzI5dh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"High Anxieties - The Mathematics of Chaos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":230552,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Lovelock","original_name":"James Lovelock","popularity":0.0362,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself","credit_id":"55e0b22c9251416f9100065c","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1068869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Malone","original_name":"David Malone","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":"/xO4gbJcrZLyEchlkXgYZxiOZPZF.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Presenter","credit_id":"55e0b23dc3a36805d4000607","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1501342,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Mark Tanner","original_name":"Mark Tanner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"55e0b2119251416f96000608","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1068869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Malone","original_name":"David Malone","popularity":0.0689,"profile_path":"/xO4gbJcrZLyEchlkXgYZxiOZPZF.jpg","credit_id":"55e0b2059251416f96000601","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1366335","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1125,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/gjsjtAxLEctZEgxYIAtbXJzI5dh.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":750}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2008-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
