But thanks to her tenacity, as well as the collaboration of some servants and members of her family (they help her rehearse her roles which are taken from Roman Empire times), the young fraulein finally gets to star in a film. But the premiere will be a disaster because due to the inexperience of the projectionist, the actors in the picture are all rapidly moving backwards, causing general laughter in the audience and spelling the end of the glorious but brief cinematic career of our heroine.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/zwAjzrSpGgq5wG9DccdrGFMRaCc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1920-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Famous Actress Cicala Formica","video":false,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325924,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lia Formia","original_name":"Lia Formia","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"5696a53192514177fa000414","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325925,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Umberto Zanuccoli","original_name":"Umberto Zanuccoli","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"5696a537925141780d000457","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1361319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Riccardo Bertacchini","original_name":"Riccardo Bertacchini","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"5696a53e92514177f80003df","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325926,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Renato Piacentini","original_name":"Renato Piacentini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"5696a545c3a36842a3000422","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1325927,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Diomede Procaccini","original_name":"Diomede Procaccini","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":8,"character":"","credit_id":"5696a54c92514177fe000404","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171365,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucio D'Ambra","original_name":"Lucio D'Ambra","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c6b9251416c910f4531","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171365,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucio D'Ambra","original_name":"Lucio D'Ambra","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5696a52a925141780a0003c2","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1171365,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lucio D'Ambra","original_name":"Lucio D'Ambra","popularity":0.0453,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5696a52192514177fa000410","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0356728","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/zwAjzrSpGgq5wG9DccdrGFMRaCc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1920-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
