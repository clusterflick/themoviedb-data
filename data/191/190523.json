As they brave the mighty Mississippi for three weeks on the not-so-trusty Rosemarie, the boys’ journey becomes a cavalcade of hijinks, near death experiences, nautical close calls and impromptu sing-alongs. Featuring an illustrious cast of characters met along the way and wonderful escapades with every dock they make, the film becomes a beautiful and hilarious adventure. Originally released online in weekly episodes, the film quickly became a much-lauded addition to the Ross brothers’ already beloved body of work. This is the first time River has ever been shown on the big screen in its feature version.","popularity":0.1601,"poster_path":"/bf9zeMXC1BZYPw62GtA1wxVSYDi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"River","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":107766,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kentucker Audley","original_name":"Kentucker Audley","popularity":0.2056,"profile_path":"/wYGCTcopN9vuGnqbZrJc7fbpyxp.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"self","credit_id":"617422085294e700650549b8","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037392,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bill Ross","original_name":"Bill Ross","popularity":0.0541,"profile_path":"/tTUVPDHkrTOMwx2437DV3M8yI8l.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c659251416c910f3ad5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1037391,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Turner Ross","original_name":"Turner Ross","popularity":0.0468,"profile_path":"/lrST2CxxQR5yQmP3t2Bd1i9qIAe.jpg","credit_id":"5c88ca689251410ccfc091df","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2784726","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.675,"height":1000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/bf9zeMXC1BZYPw62GtA1wxVSYDi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":675}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2013-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
