On it at least 11 men stand or hold on to the cable. All wear dark coveralls and hats. They wave toward the camera. At the ground and on the lower floors, other workers are busy.  This picture was taken by means of a special apparatus which enabled the camera to follow the men as they were lowered to the ground.","popularity":0.0168,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1901-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Perilous Proceeding","video":false,"vote_average":5.25,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Men Leaving 200 Skyscraper on Derrick","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Workers Leaving High Building","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1521461,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Congdon","original_name":"Congdon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"561a51b5c3a3685bfe000ce6","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0337007","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":154802,"name":"silent film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1901-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
