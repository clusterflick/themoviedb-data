Entitled The Open Road, his remarkable travelogue was conceived as a series of shorts, 26 episodes in all, to be shown weekly at the cinema.  The result is a fascinating portrait of inter-war Britain, in which town and country, people and landscapes are captured as never before, in a truly unique and rich colour palette.","popularity":0.4839,"poster_path":"/uLRmSKjeip3PlwgMVIfA6HTZs6R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/iI7qdR1OFPo0U41BlpKBLD3xesh.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1926-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Open Road","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":10,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4686771,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Norman Swan","original_name":"Norman Swan","popularity":0.0379,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Himself (uncredited)","credit_id":"663228a3fe6c18012c2ef284","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":890566,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Claude Friese-Greene","original_name":"Claude Friese-Greene","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"52fe4c589251416c910f21d5","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":890566,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Claude Friese-Greene","original_name":"Claude Friese-Greene","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663228c39590e3012cba3472","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":890566,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Claude Friese-Greene","original_name":"Claude Friese-Greene","popularity":0.0327,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"663228cfad59b5012b6cb2c3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0283525","wikidata_id":"Q6101934","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/2bUM3EiMy1rlQ3EzruJF1pEFsX7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/uLRmSKjeip3PlwgMVIfA6HTZs6R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":392,"name":"england"},{"id":9935,"name":"travel"},{"id":33490,"name":"filmmaking"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1926-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1926-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"John Brown Shipyard on the Clyde, Glasgow, Scotland (1926)","key":"BaRZ7BKOLhM","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Clip","official":true,"published_at":"2008-06-26T14:39:13.000Z","id":"66322832006b01012d1d15aa"}]}}}
