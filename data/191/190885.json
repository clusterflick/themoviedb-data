Recorded in New York at the Beacon Theater on 30th November 1989, the concert featured two special guests and long-time friends Mose Allison and John Lee Hooker, each of whom performed some of their own songs. This concert mainly consisted of Morrison's work from his last two albums, including four songs from both Avalon Sunset and Irish Heartbeat, and features jazz singer Georgie Fame on Hammond organ. Some reviewers have stated that Van Morrison was not in best shape during the concert, with his voice probably strained by a cold.","popularity":0.1035,"poster_path":"/kFbODBotYv2Pk7AVd2XMkGDOcTI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Van Morrison: The Concert","video":false,"vote_average":4,"vote_count":2,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76142,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Van Morrison","original_name":"Van Morrison","popularity":0.2072,"profile_path":"/p2dxqN8jaBIgWfFeecQZP875Wbu.jpg","cast_id":0,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5341643bc3a36814ff001bdb","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1226089,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Georgie Fame","original_name":"Georgie Fame","popularity":0.0543,"profile_path":"/r6v14WVcJ6toDAH5ffDLRLh25WQ.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ed80658e4b576002037cc92","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1696190,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mose Allison","original_name":"Mose Allison","popularity":0.0382,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ed806a196e30b002295da62","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7207,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Lee Hooker","original_name":"John Lee Hooker","popularity":0.0617,"profile_path":"/lz69wugVkbqqKb0p0vbXEgKhHmB.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ed806b78ddc34001fda6797","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82259,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jon Small","original_name":"Jon Small","popularity":0.1282,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5ed807343a9937001f554c03","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0378960","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.698,"height":2150,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/s96R4HBrgChEzNyVFPIYtxo1GYn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1800,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/kFbODBotYv2Pk7AVd2XMkGDOcTI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1200}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":6029,"name":"concert"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
