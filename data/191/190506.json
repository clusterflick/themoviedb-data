Even without trouble-plagued drummer Tommy Lee (in his place, Hole's Samantha Maloney powerfully beats the skins), the Crüe sizzles through a 95-minute set of headbanging anthems like \"Kickstart My Heart,\" \"Dr. Feelgood,\" and \"Shout at the Devil.\" Even a raucous cover version of \"White Punk on Dope\" fits snugly into the Crüe's sound, with Vince Neil's vocals, Mick Mars's guitar, and Nikki Sixx's bass playing all in fine fettle.  Track Listing:  01. Kickstart My Heart,  02. Same Ol’ Situation  03. Primal Scream  04. Punched in the Teeth By Love  05. Dr. Feelgood  06. Home Sweet Home  07. Don’t Go Away Mad (Just Go Away)  08. Piece of Your Action  09. Wild Side  10. Hell on High Heels  11. Looks That Kill  12. Girls, Girls, Girls  13. Live Wire  14. White Punks on Dope  15.
