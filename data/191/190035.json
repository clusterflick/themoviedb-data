An artist close to the avant-gardes, André Sauvage composed the first great filmed portrait of Paris. Its ambitious symphony of a big city marries, on the music composed by Jeff Mills, the changing rhythm of the Belle Époque. Contemporary of the dizzying explorations of Dziga Vertov and Walter Ruttmann, Sauvage is less fascinated by speed than by the repertoire of urban mobility, attentive to the neighborhoods he crosses, always curious about their furtive inhabitants. He draws a portrait of Paris in five studies: Paris-Port, North-South, the islands of Paris, the Little Belt and from the Saint-Jacques tower to the Sainte-Geneviève mountain.","popularity":0.1839,"poster_path":"/7vi9kc3E7ZHqG52Q5m0avHm4W7g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1928-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Études sur Paris","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":9,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Sauvage","original_name":"André Sauvage","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/aaOsm5G9PWpMnkGuBj54tNMmQ0Z.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c549251416c910f1a3f","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Sauvage","original_name":"André Sauvage","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/aaOsm5G9PWpMnkGuBj54tNMmQ0Z.jpg","credit_id":"64d1bd4cc3bffe0f04f8f491","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Sauvage","original_name":"André Sauvage","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/aaOsm5G9PWpMnkGuBj54tNMmQ0Z.jpg","credit_id":"5f90a098c048a900384294b0","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Sauvage","original_name":"André Sauvage","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/aaOsm5G9PWpMnkGuBj54tNMmQ0Z.jpg","credit_id":"5f90a0ac383df20036ae1146","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1589656,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jean de Miéville","original_name":"Jean de Miéville","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5f90a0baf8aee80036c6b069","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170921,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"André Sauvage","original_name":"André Sauvage","popularity":0.0639,"profile_path":"/aaOsm5G9PWpMnkGuBj54tNMmQ0Z.jpg","credit_id":"5f90a0a3c048a9003741d2ef","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0243685","wikidata_id":"Q16685909","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/loK4wVzofB5TqFQjD3Xa3v0WGL9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1920}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":2100,"iso_639_1":"fr","file_path":"/7vi9kc3E7ZHqG52Q5m0avHm4W7g.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1400}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":90,"name":"paris, france"},{"id":6409,"name":"city guide"},{"id":320951,"name":"french society"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1928-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
