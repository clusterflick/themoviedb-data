He goes to a cabaret on his birthday, helps a pretty young woman and her guardian avoid a raid, but gets tossed from college for bad behavior. His disgusted father dispatches him to seek his fortune. Blaze jumps a freight, befriends a fake British duke and a sporting African-American, and is offered a prize fight in Galveston. He wins, but may have killed his opponent, so he takes the offer of the woman from the cabaret to accompany her to Begonia, where she's a princess about to be crowned. A court minister, the dastardly Count Verensky, has plans to share the throne and her affections. Can the plucky American help the Europeans sort things out?","popularity":0.2512,"poster_path":"/ie25JkAlx6UtywkrkHR83KggC69.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48490,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chadwick Pictures Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"His father told him to fight his own way, and he did!","title":"American Pluck","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":633744,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Walsh","original_name":"George Walsh","popularity":0.1347,"profile_path":"/hLkVjr3BHI9FyBI2I1vqWr6s3NB.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Blaze Derringer","credit_id":"52fe4c739251416c910f554f","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":148819,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Wanda Hawley","original_name":"Wanda Hawley","popularity":0.0534,"profile_path":"/hDLCnGfPRTwp6egZxHn7EIRsdaB.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Princess Alicia","credit_id":"5d3c9a2d0486380012ed853a","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":128328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sidney De Gray","original_name":"Sidney De Gray","popularity":0.0763,"profile_path":"/SOgFn4B9q5LBIxamOlPWoiKKua.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"Count Birkhaff","credit_id":"5d3c9a33ede1b0617eeacd2e","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1013178,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank Leigh","original_name":"Frank Leigh","popularity":0.2182,"profile_path":"/jUCNJGDcHgU7O2LMNMZdTVnv3IR.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Count Verensky","credit_id":"5d3c9a3ba1d33200110cb4ad","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Wilson","original_name":"Tom Wilson","popularity":0.1718,"profile_path":"/wl63iKG9u51UY2dlULyramJhLnX.jpg","cast_id":9,"character":"Jefferson Lee","credit_id":"5d3c9a4521621b000fef2720","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29274,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo White","original_name":"Leo White","popularity":0.1971,"profile_path":"/pKJDApReiE0EVmmkTYbHNW7d1Yu.jpg","cast_id":10,"character":"Lord Raleigh","credit_id":"5d3c9a4cede1b0617eeacd37","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1170310,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dan Mason","original_name":"Dan Mason","popularity":0.0646,"profile_path":"/3EnSodNGJtKXAFVWRwslWuUewed.jpg","cast_id":11,"character":"American Consul","credit_id":"619ab94faf58cb00666cfca8","order":6},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3319409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Wing","original_name":"Pat Wing","popularity":0.053,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":12,"character":"Flower Girl at Coronation (uncredited)","credit_id":"619ab95d1feac100905aeb56","order":7},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1018113,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toby Wing","original_name":"Toby Wing","popularity":0.1479,"profile_path":"/7jV2Fls9yU09VK89Cvaf8vXdb8I.jpg","cast_id":13,"character":"Flower Girl at Coronation (uncredited)","credit_id":"619ab97367b61300447d92fd","order":8}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1171508,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Stanton","original_name":"Richard Stanton","popularity":0.08,"profile_path":"/dWdVkOzrRPA6GZt0ez0LBUpn2lX.jpg","credit_id":"52fe4c739251416c910f554b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148431,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ralph Spence","original_name":"Ralph Spence","popularity":0.1061,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5d3c99f7ede1b02f43eb23f0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2372351,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Eugene P.
