Another young lady in bathing attire reclines on the bank. The latter suddenly discovers two hoboes coming toward the bathers and immediately gives the alarm. They throw water over the hoboes, who gather up the clothes of the fair bathers and make off, compelling the bathers to walk home in barrels. In order to conceal themselves as much as possible they hold the barrels rather high.","popularity":0.3079,"poster_path":"/av4aLfiDuN7EWQfW9y7L8XzSIiV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18758,"logo_path":"/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png","name":"Edison Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1902-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Interrupted Bathers","video":false,"vote_average":3.786,"vote_count":14,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Interrupted Bathers","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1074091,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George S.
