Here, in the third film of the series, they enter from our left, hand in hand, a sylvan backdrop behind them. They're in fancy dress: he in three-piece suit and tie, bowler hat in hand; she in frilly floor-length dress, hat, and long braid of hair behind. They do a carefully choreographed dance - he's comic with large nose and male-pattern baldness splitting white curly hair; she's festive and smiling. They stay in sync. The camera is stationary, and it's one take.","popularity":0.1859,"poster_path":"/48FC9jortdPsgLYNXeTJ6aW5UOs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope & Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1902-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Foxy Grandpa and Polly in a Little Hilarity","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":7,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","title":"Foxy papa és Polly tánca","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carrie DeMar","original_name":"Carrie DeMar","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":0,"character":"Polly","credit_id":"565c5a82c3a3685072008100","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1542723,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joseph Hart","original_name":"Joseph Hart","popularity":0.0409,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Foxy Grandpa","credit_id":"565c5a91925141692e00839b","order":1}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1176430,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Robert K.
