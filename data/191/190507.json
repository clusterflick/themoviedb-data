Fred has fallen for Lia, a comely bartender in the Berlin Cabaret. He proposes to her, much to the horror of his family, which considers Lia and her unsophisticated father far below their caste. The family convinces Fred to give up the girl in exchange for increased position and income in the company. But Fred's lapse is momentary, and he again pursues Lia. But she, by this time, has learned of his erstwhile agreement and has agreed to marry someone else.","popularity":0.4453,"poster_path":"/sce8q49ZgbIeFGjF63YRQBbSGA4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67668,"logo_path":null,"name":"May-Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":45240,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deutsches Lichtspiel-Syndikat","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1933-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Her Majesty Love","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51591,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Otto Wallburg","original_name":"Otto Wallburg","popularity":0.2041,"profile_path":"/EMAGLvMtCfU0WhiIY4BEWygDLz.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Othmar von Wellingen - Fred's brother","credit_id":"56d76ed592514111eb005f87","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13906,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Francis Lederer","original_name":"Francis Lederer","popularity":0.1952,"profile_path":"/jf2hWEynH4PbygMSp0hbXqAGJ8l.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Fred von Wellingen","credit_id":"56d76ef392514162b700370b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":590761,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Käthe von Nagy","original_name":"Käthe von Nagy","popularity":0.1331,"profile_path":"/dP0fB5yzACRMv1C4zvNVzE35DRJ.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"Lia Török","credit_id":"56d76f0392514112cd003df7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94110,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"S.Z.
