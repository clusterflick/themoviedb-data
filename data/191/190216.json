The film opens with his wife (Lorna Tolentino), best friend (Bayani Agbayani) and dotting mother (Vangie Labalan) waiting patiently for Oca's arrival at the airport. We are then introduced with the rest of the star studded cast, as Oca visits his house, where he meets up with his estranged kids (Shaina Magdayao, Arron Villaflor, Julian Estrada), and parents in loss (in-laws), which shows no affection whatsoever towards him. Only his drinking buddies, mother, and sister, are excited on his return, only because they see him as a prized cash cow. Jose Javier Reyes revisits his movie, Bayarang Puso (1997), in a cheese filled dance sequence, Oca drunk as ever grooves with no pretension. This and other embarrassing situations tears the family slowly apart.","popularity":0.1315,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":64508,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maverick Films","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2007-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Katas ng Saudi","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","title":"Katas ng Saudi (2007)","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"US","title":"Katas ng Saudi","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":512945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jinggoy Estrada","original_name":"Jinggoy Estrada","popularity":0.0239,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c5a9251416c910f2619","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":312722,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorna Tolentino","original_name":"Lorna Tolentino","popularity":0.8754,"profile_path":"/plrebrqTsx4l6rbsDm8bnvz5dcX.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c5a9251416c910f261d","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140418,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bayani Agbayani","original_name":"Bayani Agbayani","popularity":0.1542,"profile_path":"/gkBwG69GP9OlN0btCVtfI21k768.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c5a9251416c910f2621","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1043127,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Vangie Labalan","original_name":"Vangie Labalan","popularity":0.275,"profile_path":"/tJQj1tdd3FsqY5G6B3xMXq1HC2k.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"52fe4c5b9251416c910f2625","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1234526,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Arron Villaflor","original_name":"Arron Villaflor","popularity":1.3737,"profile_path":"/uAdQvivTHoLLRgGAojxo9neElvq.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"","credit_id":"538dc5cd0e0a2667020064ac","order":4},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":113255,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Shaina Magdayao","original_name":"Shaina Magdayao","popularity":0.3621,"profile_path":"/nL10Qbz1bqDawZIhr5xZ8LMJqLF.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"","credit_id":"538dc6270e0a26671200643b","order":5},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":565246,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rayver Cruz","original_name":"Rayver Cruz","popularity":0.1175,"profile_path":"/3HLI51yMAhLQuvhkBj2aroHrxKA.jpg","cast_id":7,"character":"","credit_id":"538dc6790e0a26671800633b","order":6}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227353,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jose Javier Reyes","original_name":"Jose Javier Reyes","popularity":0.2181,"profile_path":"/mjOAYnSVsHliTPGVZlPnaF5gekb.jpg","credit_id":"60a80144501cf200400f3a78","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227353,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jose Javier Reyes","original_name":"Jose Javier Reyes","popularity":0.2181,"profile_path":"/mjOAYnSVsHliTPGVZlPnaF5gekb.jpg","credit_id":"60a80133501cf20026d2c501","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1038140","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","release_dates":[{"certification":"Katas ng Saudi","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2007-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
