This perfectionism, combined with an unconditional love for books, for the traditional printing craft, and a commitment to the quality standards of manufacturing (in the original sense of the word, made by hand), has gained worldwide attention. The most internationally renowned photographic artists vie for the opportunity to collaborate with Gerhard Steidl, to conceive and produce the perfect publication with him.","popularity":0.1905,"poster_path":"/iy77bLyJ5GLnUZVjdfhboe2UmC2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How to Make a Book with Steidl","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Kustantaja kutsumuksesta","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","title":"Konsten att göra en bok","type":"Swedish title"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"世界一美しい本を作る男　シュタイデルとの旅","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":16884,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Daniel Schönauer","original_name":"Daniel Schönauer","popularity":0.0311,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad9fc61f748b008237209a","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":887612,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ingo Fliess","original_name":"Ingo Fliess","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad9fcd20e6a500e0f2424b","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3406030,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Benedikt Hoenes","original_name":"Benedikt Hoenes","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63ad9fb457530e00c480e10e","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Mixer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":148765,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jörg Adolph","original_name":"Jörg Adolph","popularity":0.0662,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b625da9251411bce000d5b","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":928591,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gereon Wetzel","original_name":"Gereon Wetzel","popularity":0.0835,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"57b625f0c3a3682bb6000add","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt1745722","wikidata_id":"Q21161468","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.711,"height":1079,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/iy77bLyJ5GLnUZVjdfhboe2UmC2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":767}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2010-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
