The orchestra plays, rather badly, excerpts from Carmen. Mickey appears as a snake charmer, but the snake is revealed to be a cat with a snake's head painted on its tail. Mickey does a belly dance, to the audience's delight. Mickey then plays the piano, but the piano and stool, apparently annoyed at the violence and complexity of the piece, kick him off stage.","popularity":0.3681,"poster_path":"/rWAbL5t1H4krWBcEMPNFmiug5P8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Opry House","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":34,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","title":"Mickey y el piano","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"L'opéra","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","title":"ミッキーのオペラ見学","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Im Tiervarieté","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","title":"Деревенская опера","type":""},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","title":"Musse Pigg vid varietén","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2106,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Walt Disney","original_name":"Walt Disney","popularity":0.6719,"profile_path":"/fnB3Yt4dPiVODHzfLwntISAvbhw.jpg","credit_id":"54d836c7c3a3683b990068c8","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":551674,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Carl W.
