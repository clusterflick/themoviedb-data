Evil attempts to rewrite the past, and the mutant heroes must prevent a perilous future in these five time-bending episodes. History repeats itself when Wolverine's past resurfaces, forcing him to repay old debts in \"Stolen Lives.\" In \"Code of Conduct,\" Wolverine's history returns again when the X-Men are threatened by the Silver Samurai who challenges the adamantine hero to another duel. In \"Badlands,\" Logan's captivity helps spawn a new breed of Sentinels to terrorize the future. And before Mojo rips their friendship apart, Nightcrawler struggles to convince a brainwashed Wolverine of their lost days together in \"Hunting Grounds.\" Finally, in \"Backlash,\" when Wolverine learns that Master Mold is the same nemesis for tomorrow's X-Men, he must protect his fellow mutants before the future becomes obsolete.","popularity":3.2438,"poster_path":"/lcU4z9GWBQ2vjpEQjPIJycmIapH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":420,"logo_path":"/hUzeosd33nzE5MCNsZxCGEKTXaQ.png","name":"Marvel Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":87468,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toonz Entertainment","origin_country":"IN"},{"id":158894,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Serve International","origin_country":"US"},{"id":29604,"logo_path":null,"name":"Liberation Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":101760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toonz Animation India","origin_country":"IN"},{"id":203883,"logo_path":null,"name":"EVA Finance","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":13252,"logo_path":"/1gKwYyTDNhumwBKUlKqoxXRUdpC.png","name":"Marvel Animation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolverine and the X-Men: Fate of the Future","video":true,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":6,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":571562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Blum","original_name":"Steve Blum","popularity":0.9828,"profile_path":"/cpO0muunoigq1WHegeOEI1AIQAo.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Logan / Wolverine (voice) (archive footage)","credit_id":"61638010e942ee006272df85","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":60460,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"A.J.
