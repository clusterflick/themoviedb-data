Though bound by rivalry and jealousy, Vidyadhara and Kalavathi fall in love and meet secretly. Nalacoobra, driven by desire, spies on them, deceives both through disguises, and causes Vidyadhara to believe Kalavathi is unfaithful. Heartbroken, Vidyadhara leaves Dwaraka, and Kalavathi sets out alone to find him. Nalacoobra repeatedly pursues and tries to violate her, while Rambha, cursed by Indra and blinded by jealousy, plots Kalavathi’s death. Kalavathi endures storms, deception, and exile, yet remains devoted. Ultimately, Rambha manipulates Kalpalika, a fanatic devotee, into preparing Kalavathi’s sacrifice at the Bhubaneshwar temple in pursuit of divine power.","popularity":0,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Magical Rambha","title":"Maaya Rambha","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
