Moving between archival engravings from London and intimate conversations with the filmmaker’s grandmother and great-aunt, former midwives in rural southeast Turkey, the film brings different times and places into dialogue. Through archives and oral histories, recurring gestures, rituals, and ways of care reappear across centuries. The film approaches the witch not as a myth, but as a figure shaped by fear, control, and misogyny, carried forward through women’s memory, labour, and survival.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/tnt58uCKVu5QrxmtBqPt2QGcLP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2026-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Healers, Midwives, Witches","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5937692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aysıla Köse","original_name":"Aysıla Köse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6966e7001f5090e4c27033f4","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5937692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aysıla Köse","original_name":"Aysıla Köse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6966e7212129380e84686b06","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5937692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aysıla Köse","original_name":"Aysıla Köse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6966e729d269d832d1cacb6e","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4682218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simay Yigit","original_name":"Simay Yigit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6966e7432b7adbb712687219","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4682218,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Simay Yigit","original_name":"Simay Yigit","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6966e75016a4850c5c703375","department":"Production","job":"Associate Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5937696,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Lene De Montaigu","original_name":"Lene De Montaigu","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6966e75fccec70fd6bebfd98","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5937692,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aysıla Köse","original_name":"Aysıla Köse","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6966e76c16a4850c5c703378","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2883580,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Boris Gétaz","original_name":"Boris Gétaz","popularity":0.1005,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6966e7855405f55122865fbf","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Editor"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5937698,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Elena Feduchi","original_name":"Elena Feduchi","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6966e793d712552801ebfcd4","department":"Art","job":"Graphic Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":4570484,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Sriprasad Sahoo","original_name":"Sriprasad Sahoo","popularity":0.0597,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6966e7a12746fc6304b1f0fd","department":"Editing","job":"Colorist"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5937699,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Pelin Topal","original_name":"Pelin Topal","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6966e7b1a2f652b158b1f10c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound Recordist"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.75,"height":1920,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/tnt58uCKVu5QrxmtBqPt2QGcLP.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1440}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","release_dates":[{"certification":"12A","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2026-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
