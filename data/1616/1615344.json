Presented on multiple large screens, this seven-channel video installation consists of images of desolate landscapes and a soundtrack that combines singing, street noise, and the sounds of engines and gunfire. The overlapping images appear in rapid movement, creating a chaotic sense of transit through a desert region. Akerman collected the images and sounds with a Blackberry phone camera while travelling in conflict zones in the Middle East. She deliberately erases any clues of a precise geographical location, instead portrays chaos and violence without context—a world of conflict embedded in everyday existence.","popularity":0.0071,"poster_path":"/aRx1sx0Lr4dwM47Jv5hLtfSgkH1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Now","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130030,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Chantal Akerman","original_name":"Chantal Akerman","popularity":0.6323,"profile_path":"/6Q59Air1EjLHfq8NvvBpbTTgnWZ.jpg","credit_id":"6966689b143d6b5b6bb9b8aa","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.666,"height":751,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/aRx1sx0Lr4dwM47Jv5hLtfSgkH1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Venice Biennale Arte 2015","release_date":"2015-05-13T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
