From the nerves of calling his first game to the confidence built through years of live broadcasts across multiple sports, Jackson traces the moments that shaped his voice, his identity, and his ambitions.  Through personal reflection and behind-the-scenes access, the film explores what it means to find opportunity in college athletics media — the connections, the pressure, and the belief required to speak with clarity in real time. More than a story about broadcasting, The Faces of PSN is a portrait of growth, purpose, and the quiet determination behind the calls we hear but rarely see.","popularity":0.0429,"poster_path":"/xo3Fw3JeMaVndse13aJzpJzbK4u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2025-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What it takes to be heard.","title":"The Faces of PSN","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5937428,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Shank","original_name":"Jackson Shank","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Jackson Shank","credit_id":"6966bb7c768920ee984bd737","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5937430,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Colby Balzer","original_name":"Colby Balzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6966bb9417ed63f0b1e8a102","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5937430,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Colby Balzer","original_name":"Colby Balzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6966bba59cff4c0350a62e51","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5937430,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Colby Balzer","original_name":"Colby Balzer","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6966bbcca1a161ddb5b6c21e","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/xo3Fw3JeMaVndse13aJzpJzbK4u.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":2000},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_3166_1":"US","iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/2QpEPnucugROZNlg0qwFGgPz1nL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":1284,"name":"identity"},{"id":2246,"name":"confidence"},{"id":3734,"name":"ambition"},{"id":10683,"name":"coming of age"},{"id":9817,"name":"behind the scenes"},{"id":46962,"name":"discipline"},{"id":159290,"name":"sports documentary"},{"id":182250,"name":"personal growth"},{"id":189092,"name":"journey"},{"id":192700,"name":"grounded"},{"id":198631,"name":"opportunity"},{"id":199165,"name":"self confidence"},{"id":210434,"name":"thoughtful"},{"id":211140,"name":"college sports"},{"id":224703,"name":"honest"},{"id":225219,"name":"reflective"},{"id":281446,"name":"purpose"},{"id":281585,"name":"inspirational"},{"id":285902,"name":"student"},{"id":292593,"name":"intimate"},{"id":304925,"name":"career goals"},{"id":325804,"name":"earnest"},{"id":342283,"name":"dreams and aspirations"},{"id":342865,"name":"observational"},{"id":365709,"name":"sports broadcasting"},{"id":365710,"name":"seton hall"},{"id":365711,"name":"student broadcaster"},{"id":365712,"name":"campus media"},{"id":365713,"name":"pirate sports network"},{"id":365714,"name":"on-air commentary"},{"id":365715,"name":"live sports production"},{"id":365716,"name":"finding your voice"},{"id":365717,"name":"career development"},{"id":365718,"name":"professional goals"},{"id":365719,"name":"student media"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"NR","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2025-04-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
