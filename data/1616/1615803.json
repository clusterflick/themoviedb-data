His marriage crumbling, his career stalled, he's had some bad days. But things are looking up, at least for one weekend, when his dear friend Pep Pelletier visits-carrying two totes packed with good food and fine wine. Just before hitting the road, however, Pep decides to bring along his daughter, Frances. That's when the weekend takes a turn. A story of middle age, youthful mojo, and misplaced ladles, Spark Wheel proves once and for all that you're only as old as you feel. And look. And act.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/1BaCr2r8kl0YnGtEuMS7VnyBJk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18615,"logo_path":null,"name":"Love Lane Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2024-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A spiraling dad reunites with his morally slippery friend and finds that true friendship isn't always so friendly.","title":"Spark Wheel","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":5937892,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Madison Elizondo","original_name":"Madison Elizondo","popularity":0,"profile_path":"/kECMpD2vQPSluh6MFHUcs0tFDSn.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"Francis","credit_id":"69671cb776c7bf8713686bd9","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1251377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dave Hill","original_name":"Dave Hill","popularity":0.5718,"profile_path":"/uiYG9Jg9bGfXqgPj1R9zGzcPDZd.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Benny","credit_id":"69671cd13c315e481cebfe2b","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":115974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Pally","original_name":"Adam Pally","popularity":1.0627,"profile_path":"/yY13PEaVbPoXT5MkitVxTfdAZnU.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Pep","credit_id":"69671ce07b2ef4bbd8ebfde7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5937893,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Smootie","original_name":"Smootie","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Smootie","credit_id":"69671cf34dc477f003866158","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":87191,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Billy Kent","original_name":"Billy Kent","popularity":0.28,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69671d203c315e481cebfe40","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":87191,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Billy Kent","original_name":"Billy Kent","popularity":0.28,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69671d4b70b6b71451866130","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5937894,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Daphne Montandon","original_name":"Daphne Montandon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69671d6d3c315e481cebfe54","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5937895,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Maccabee Montandon","original_name":"Maccabee Montandon","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69671d860bae9c871e8660a4","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":5811703,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Alexandra Leinweber","original_name":"Alexandra Leinweber","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69671da82746fc6304b1f1c9","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1463093,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Derek Wiesehahn","original_name":"Derek Wiesehahn","popularity":0.124,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"69671e45daaba91322866110","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt34878140","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1225,"iso_3166_1":null,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/1BaCr2r8kl0YnGtEuMS7VnyBJk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":817}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2024-01-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
