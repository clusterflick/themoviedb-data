I knew that this deeply rhythmic two-minute song needed some kind of somatic imagery. I needed to move with my body and my camera as I was shooting it.  A few days later, I went to “The New Woman Behind the Camera” exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In this show, I saw two photos by two women photographers from the 1920s whose work I had never seen before. These images guided me to a way of interpreting the physicality and the intimacy of Kristine’s song.  Soon afterward, I invited my friend Kim Wilberforce to be in my film and to interpret the song herself, through her vibrant wardrobe and her precise, ecstatic clapping gestures. \" Lynne Sachs","popularity":0.0781,"poster_path":"/jmOq86vInekopnIVyHhXlUW75Vx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Figure and I","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3298394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Wilberforce","original_name":"Kim Wilberforce","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"618578c063a69500935f28a9","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1438516,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lynne Sachs","original_name":"Lynne Sachs","popularity":0.0652,"profile_path":"/dFFx0RQimWEqBILDmZnNqwniJMt.jpg","credit_id":"618578ae3e09f3002c8d1314","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3298395,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Kristine Leschper","original_name":"Kristine Leschper","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618578da75f1ad008e3f688f","department":"Sound","job":"Music"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/aFFpejtDXdCJprcjt1KliUvHohI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/jmOq86vInekopnIVyHhXlUW75Vx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
