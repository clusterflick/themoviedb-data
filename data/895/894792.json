The film moves from a World War II love story, to the next generation's inter-racial marriage, and then to LaFountain's own experience as a child of mixed heritage who walks a fine between her Native American and Jewish cultures. Captured with beautiful 16mm cinematography, the film explores LaFountain's grandmother's move from a three-story townhouse, downsizing her lifetime’s collections of art and antiques. The granddaughter’s camera travels with the objects from coast to coast as she collects her family's stories.","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/aXi6jHqi1ezWogtw1ZoxIHv3McD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of
