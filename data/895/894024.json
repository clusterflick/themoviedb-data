Before WWII, he owned 22 department stores with 6,000 employees. He possessed a unique collection of 60,000 rare books in German and Hebrew and founded a modern, Jewish publishing house. He was the lifelong supporter of Shmuel Yosef Agnon and he owned the Haaretz newspaper which still survives on the border of consensus. He supported secular, Jewish culture and identified with humanist, liberal Judaism, a relic of 19th century Europe. Today, in an age of unscrupulous market economy and militant Judaism, Salman Schocken’s ways point to an alternative, perhaps not entirely lost.","popularity":0.0387,"poster_path":"/h0J4UIEAOE8Y0xPY05vxCP9tI5w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141652,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atzmor Productions","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":1410,"logo_path":null,"name":"TAG/TRAUM Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2067,"logo_path":"/y5knLIUjYsKBIlM4W0dLruWwYaC.png","name":"RBB","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2020-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schocken, on the Verge of Consensus","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","title":"Schocken, Al Gvul HaKonsensus","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3296561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noemi Schory","original_name":"Noemi Schory","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618389ce3faba0008f606399","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3296561,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Noemi Schory","original_name":"Noemi Schory","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"618389d5e93e950042d728f0","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1599738,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Liran Atzmor","original_name":"לירן עצמור","popularity":0.0478,"profile_path":"/hFuT3DAUlmCnPXYbhBbesZir4vf.jpg","credit_id":"6491509e42bf01011e753477","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32413,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Gerd Haag","original_name":"Gerd Haag","popularity":0.071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649150a92f8d0900c6675271","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3856553,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Boaz Schory","original_name":"Boaz Schory","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649150b442bf0100e4a04328","department":"Sound","job":"Music"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1115350,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Uriel Sinai","original_name":"Uriel Sinai","popularity":0.0261,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649150c12f8d090100abe773","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2595073,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Michal Oppenheim","original_name":"Michal Oppenheim","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"649150ce42bf010101c032db","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt13117182","wikidata_id":"Q108473891","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.706,"height":1400,"iso_639_1":"de","file_path":"/h0J4UIEAOE8Y0xPY05vxCP9tI5w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":989}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"he","note":"Docaviv International Documentary Film Festival","release_date":"2020-09-07T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
