We follow her and her two adorable children, Max and Ella, as their new stepdad Mike moves into their family home. At the heart of the story is a very special storybook – a precious item belonging to Max from his birth father. The book celebrates the power of storytelling and how it can deepen family bonds; as the family are shown delighting in the magic of Disney storytelling, beautiful animation springs off the pages, igniting the true spirit of Christmas. Follow their emotional journey as we see them combine existing festive traditions with wonderful new ones. In partnership with Make-A-Wish. Featuring \"Love Runs Deeper\" by Gregory Porter.","popularity":0.762,"poster_path":"/cwUjKVme08yeezWOvCQfwkYYB59.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165990,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flux Animation
