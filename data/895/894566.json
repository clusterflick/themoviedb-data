Parson Jones and his church committee protest that the child should be brought up in more refined surroundings, but the cowboys, particularly Duck Sing, Aliso's Chinese cook, are so enamored of Little Red that they donate their poker money to the church to placate the congregation. After Little Red catches pneumonia and nearly dies, however, Dr. Kirk insists that the boy either live with the minister or acquire a mother through the marriage of one of the cowboys. While Little Red is recuperating at the parson's home, ranch hand Tom Gilroy courts the only marriageable women in town -- a widow and two spinsters -- but much to his relief, they all turn him down. In the end, Duck Sing and the colonel join forces and legally adopt him.","popularity":0.1259,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Red Decides","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32138,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean Hersholt","original_name":"Jean Hersholt","popularity":0.2104,"profile_path":"/aQ7HTIXEmlnwghYvWk5NS8NBI5M.jpg","cast_id":8,"character":"Sour Milk","credit_id":"671461260cb6252f99088c5a","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":89600,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alice Davenport","original_name":"Alice Davenport","popularity":0.057,"profile_path":"/wDTYw5DAcHcgueWfbIFTuQLU6ph.jpg","cast_id":5,"character":"Widow Bolton","credit_id":"61855802f8aee800268698f9","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frederick Vroom","original_name":"Frederick Vroom","popularity":0.1131,"profile_path":"/nGnxOg6NMKbyxs9V4cdXsRzPRqx.jpg","cast_id":3,"character":"Col.
