Set in a small touristic village in India, we follow the story of Hayan Mir and his friend Aasif Alam long with professor Shlok Manhas. Hayan is a young man desiring to make videos to attract tourists to his village and promote peace. His actions are being misinterpreted as he visits a terrorist camp. Although he eventually gets released after relentless efforts of the professor and his lawyer uncle pleading for his release, the damages caused to everyone involved are priceless and hefty.","popularity":0.0256,"poster_path":"/keWEJkhi6NLBWRP2skOX5zxY6qO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nobel Peace","video":true,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt10262112","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/xMTfxHJFOuIqXibads4BbScQcJd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1686,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/keWEJkhi6NLBWRP2skOX5zxY6qO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1125}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","release_dates":[{"certification":"UA","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"hi","note":"","release_date":"2021-10-08T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[{"iso_639_1":"en","iso_3166_1":"US","name":"Nobel Peace Trailer | Hiten Tejwani, Mudasir Zafar, Mayur Mehta | Winner Dada Sahab Phalke Best Film","key":"mnZlWliS5As","site":"YouTube","size":1080,"type":"Trailer","official":false,"published_at":"2020-12-09T09:08:24.000Z","id":"6184c506ddd52d0042b98241"}]}}}
