For hatred and accusations are never greater than longing and love for one another.  You meet the family one autumn evening in the parents' Östermalm apartment. Margareta and Henrik have invited their daughters to dinner, as they do every month. Ann lives with her son in a one bedroom apartment and struggles to make a living. Ewa and her husband live in a villa in Stocksund and must have three cars to be able to work that much.","popularity":0.4147,"poster_path":"/bH2GvhEAEzUm3IcJ3clUIIYERLd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2009-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Höst och vinter","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1675466,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Birgitta Sundberg","original_name":"Birgitta Sundberg","popularity":0.0719,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Margareta","credit_id":"61855ca107528800287db419","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3298329,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Håkan Jonson","original_name":"Håkan Jonson","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Henrik","credit_id":"61855d173e2ec800636fa178","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2936570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Odile Nunes","original_name":"Odile Nunes","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Ewa","credit_id":"61855d2a3e09f30042f9dcee","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1269601,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lena Mossegård","original_name":"Lena Mossegård","popularity":0.0743,"profile_path":"/odziVkpAYieasZyBogr0OGRvisi.jpg","cast_id":6,"character":"Ann","credit_id":"61855d3a5545ca0028c881fa","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1127462,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulla Gottlieb","original_name":"Ulla Gottlieb","popularity":0.1041,"profile_path":"/dZ5njGo3IWWj0OCGR3nOurdhnWy.jpg","credit_id":"618559d913a388006604af86","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1530501,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lars Norén","original_name":"Lars Norén","popularity":0.0963,"profile_path":"/pBeJ5BOTMBA0WRK3ok9iUPPwQvo.jpg","credit_id":"618559e51c6aa70060ed03a2","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":997656,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Bengt Fröderberg","original_name":"Bengt Fröderberg","popularity":0.0491,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61855d5e75f1ad008e3f2921","department":"Art","job":"Art Designer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3298332,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Sara Rollof-Schedin","original_name":"Sara Rollof-Schedin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61855d7f3e2ec8008d208201","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Costumer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3298332,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Sara Rollof-Schedin","original_name":"Sara Rollof-Schedin","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61855d89cb6db5008d551399","department":"Art","job":"Property Master"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2284338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ulrika Ritter","original_name":"Ulrika Ritter","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61855d9ca313b8006243973a","department":"Costume & Make-Up","job":"Makeup & Hair"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3298333,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Markus Granqvist","original_name":"Markus Granqvist","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61855dc23faba0008f634e47","department":"Lighting","job":"Lighting Design"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2165966,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ditte Feuk","original_name":"Ditte Feuk","popularity":0.0368,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61855dd83e09f3002c8cdf4d","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":963,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/yFtaROgMIbeyDC1T3P8xg1HTMW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1712}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/bH2GvhEAEzUm3IcJ3clUIIYERLd.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1080,"iso_639_1":"sv","file_path":"/jruK5ZifpfHcGUq8EppSirPxdGJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":720}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":229756,"name":"filmed play"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"sv","note":"SVT1","release_date":"2009-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":6}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
