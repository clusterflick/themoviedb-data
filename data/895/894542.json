This short was to premiere on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of East Germany. Officials rejected it, however, as an ostensibly negative portrait of GDR family life presented by an atypical woman. It was released under a different title a year later.","popularity":0.1232,"poster_path":"/dXB9E3xfn2C633yc2DeZ23anYEM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA-Studio für Wochenschau und Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1985-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"35 Photos","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","title":"Bilder aus einem Familienalbum","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3713519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karin R.","original_name":"Karin R.","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":2,"character":"herself","credit_id":"632edd107ecd28008305277f","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1080612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helke Misselwitz","original_name":"Helke Misselwitz","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/sxZgbM5mgCTdSfwJRgtfBvTh0sp.jpg","credit_id":"618540f713a3880044ec24a2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1080612,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Helke Misselwitz","original_name":"Helke Misselwitz","popularity":0.0338,"profile_path":"/sxZgbM5mgCTdSfwJRgtfBvTh0sp.jpg","credit_id":"63a9b74615a4a1008a213c84","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2294239,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jürgen Rudow","original_name":"Jürgen Rudow","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a9b754a6a4c100c8e68e70","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3409389,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Bernd Merten","original_name":"Bernd Merten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a9b769e4b57600ba0cc7d3","department":"Camera","job":"Director of Photography"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65469,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Karin Schöning","original_name":"Karin Schöning","popularity":0.0297,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"63a9b776b3316b007a8be9ee","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt16161768","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/dXB9E3xfn2C633yc2DeZ23anYEM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1985-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
