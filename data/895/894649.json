We just go on with business as usual. But climate change, just like the loss of biodiversity and the current pandemic, is a consequence of how we treat nature. Corona is a wake-up call that has disrupted all of our lives. All attention goes towards solving the current problem: controlling the SARS-CoV-2 virus. But prevention is better than cure. To do this, we have to look at how infectious diseases emerge and spread. World-renowned artist Steve Cutts created an animated film for the Nicolaas G. Pierson Foundation, in which he not only visualizes the factors that cause pandemics, but also points at the urgent measures that are needed to reduce the risk of future pandemics.","popularity":0.52,"poster_path":"/esbf1d4Jh7DctXGIJocV67G3Z1T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121366,"logo_path":null,"name":"Steven Cutts Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Viral Spiral","video":false,"vote_average":2.7,"vote_count":3,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","title":"Une spirale virale","type":""}]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Cutts","original_name":"Steve Cutts","popularity":0.1821,"profile_path":"/fYUARWVfrLHVABhnGjd7xhReE7w.jpg","credit_id":"6185ae0ea313b8008f43d37a","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324961,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Monique van Dijk Armor","original_name":"Monique van Dijk Armor","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6185ae35c5c1ef0061ec211e","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2429344,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Niko Koffeman","original_name":"Niko Koffeman","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6185ae17e7414600438d6860","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3298585,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Karen Soeters","original_name":"Karen Soeters","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6185ae3e3e2ec800637051fc","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Cutts","original_name":"Steve Cutts","popularity":0.1821,"profile_path":"/fYUARWVfrLHVABhnGjd7xhReE7w.jpg","credit_id":"6185ae0a3faba000625936f9","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324960,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Linda Broersen","original_name":"Linda Broersen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6185ae1e63a69500935fa1ca","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1324960,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Linda Broersen","original_name":"Linda Broersen","popularity":0.0168,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6185ae28075288008d0f1775","department":"Production","job":"Producer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/eUpGWheZfuLt0NBBNHUZVefdotT.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280},{"aspect_ratio":1.778,"height":720,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/kV7IL8zmvmSt4Ikh7HuWC8dAqVq.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1280}],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/esbf1d4Jh7DctXGIJocV67G3Z1T.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":3000,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/lnmBkAUdOdKyF6zM7ygfO6gU6YB.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":2000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[{"id":162272,"name":"life relationship"},{"id":259403,"name":"viral"},{"id":263548,"name":"short film"}]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":1}]},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"2021-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
