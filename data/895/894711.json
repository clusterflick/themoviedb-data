They are a young couple, but their relationship is brittle and seems to be dissolving due to both internal and external pressures. On the weekend they invite another couple for dinner, but the companionship and fun are gradually destroyed by quarrels and infidelity. Still, the two women finally seem to find understanding and solidarity in eachother. Week-End depicts how the political also permeate the private, in a way  both original and typical of its age. The tension between old and new gender roles is one cause of the problems in the relationship between Reidun and Jan, but the political is just one aspect in a film that also deals with emotions, relations and identity. Week-End is rooted in 1970s social modernism, mixing modernist storytelling strategies with a political sub-theme of female identity and solidarity","popularity":0.106,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ukeslutt","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":224566,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eli Anne Linnestad","original_name":"Eli Anne Linnestad","popularity":0.2103,"profile_path":"/fUWlSZZahLAyXiUUkv8D5cTdGoI.jpg","cast_id":1,"character":"","credit_id":"6185ef6fcb6db50042c12e39","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67006,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thor Michael Aamodt","original_name":"Thor Michael Aamodt","popularity":0.0974,"profile_path":"/ovIBgf4W0Cov4DYbJxt52sUHyrU.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"","credit_id":"6185ef7cd48cee0062d2c6b8","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3298852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Rasmussen","original_name":"Kate Rasmussen","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"","credit_id":"6185ef8fd48cee0062d2c6e7","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":125421,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nils Ole Oftebro","original_name":"Nils Ole Oftebro","popularity":0.1459,"profile_path":"/15MaEQf94iQiGB9oaS9iPdL8Wpi.jpg","cast_id":4,"character":"","credit_id":"6185ef9a3e2ec8008d21ea39","order":3}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1210541,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laila Mikkelsen","original_name":"Laila Mikkelsen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/49oLrzcmUKUGRtLdRgXs0Rd8zpf.jpg","credit_id":"6185efc71fd36f0042b85a4a","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1210541,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Laila Mikkelsen","original_name":"Laila Mikkelsen","popularity":0.0404,"profile_path":"/49oLrzcmUKUGRtLdRgXs0Rd8zpf.jpg","credit_id":"6185efd8d48cee00441d8c99","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":589177,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Per Blom","original_name":"Per Blom","popularity":0.0673,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6185efe9c5c1ef008814c281","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3298854,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Pål René Roestad","original_name":"Pål René Roestad","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6185eff71c6aa7002ca17862","department":"Crew","job":"Cinematography"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1465419,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Fred Sassebo","original_name":"Fred Sassebo","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"6185f009595a5600438d8ab6","department":"Editing","job":"Editor"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
