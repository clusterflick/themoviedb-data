Stills punctuate abstract and documentary footage, offering a collage of mediums in the face of the unknowable. \"Sorties\" is a military term-- a mission launched from a defensive position. That's sort of what a walk felt like in March 2020 in NYC. And then of course things changed; cases went up and down, the science evolved, fear waxed and waned. Of course, the pandemic continues; but I had to limit myself in making the film; March 2020-August 2021.\"","popularity":0.0286,"poster_path":"/4rYCdS4lfpE2KhTJC1UpmKO36Ou.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sorties","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1345952,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mark Street","original_name":"Mark Street","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"61865c77e93e950042dc18ea","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1500,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4rYCdS4lfpE2KhTJC1UpmKO36Ou.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":1000}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"Film Diary NYC","release_date":"2021-11-06T00:00:00.000Z","type":4}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
