Her dour parents, members of a religious sect, forbid the celebration of birthdays or holidays. Melinda finds solace in small things: a spun silver spider web, her box of treasures, and a stolen afternoon at Silver Lake on her \"day of days.\" As the movie and the year progresses, Melinda experiences ageless comforts and pains. A disgraced famous writer and a waylaid college professor, two exiles in the small Mid-Western town, haunt the edges of her sheltered life. An earthy, warmhearted waitress introduces her to the blues and a fizzy drink called Cola-Cola. She receives her first explorative attention from a boy. Escalating tragedy shatters Melinda's innocence. Devastated, she flees into the night where, by drawing on her tenacious spirit, she ultimately triumphs.","popularity":0.357,"poster_path":"/8HsgkbSOXE7nctM9mXxRq0LeMVW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113060,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dawntreader Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melinda's World","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1841338,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jenifer Rose Olivares","original_name":"Jenifer Rose Olivares","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Melinda McCormack","credit_id":"5c2f7d65c3a3682915a73b06","order":0},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29222,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zac Efron","original_name":"Zac Efron","popularity":4.3062,"profile_path":"/pdWXP7XG6qqOoxoLid1DWYwmaMY.jpg","cast_id":2,"character":"Stuart Wasser","credit_id":"5c2f7d85c3a36879cfa297e7","order":1},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1191868,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Michael Kappler","original_name":"Thomas Michael Kappler","popularity":0.0143,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":3,"character":"Meredith McCormack","credit_id":"5c2f7d9fc3a3680b8ca2b0f2","order":2},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2208405,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer McCluskey","original_name":"Jennifer McCluskey","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":4,"character":"Alice Wasser","credit_id":"5c2f7dd30e0a267eb33a4e5e","order":3},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2208409,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christina Raines","original_name":"Christina Raines","popularity":0.0071,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":5,"character":"Amelia McCormack","credit_id":"5c2f7e3d0e0a260fc13b44ae","order":4}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2208414,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marianne Kennedy","original_name":"Marianne Kennedy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2f7ec69251415a986deaf5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2208413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Baumgarten","original_name":"David Baumgarten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2f7e71c3a3682919a70496","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2208413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Baumgarten","original_name":"David Baumgarten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2f7e83c3a3680835a2a374","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2208413,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Baumgarten","original_name":"David Baumgarten","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2f7eb0c3a3682919a704d5","department":"Production","job":"Producer"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2208414,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marianne Kennedy","original_name":"Marianne Kennedy","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2f7e939251416e456dfc79","department":"Writing","job":"Writer"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt2179506","wikidata_id":"Q3305071","facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1866,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/8HsgkbSOXE7nctM9mXxRq0LeMVW.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":1244},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/32pqgDd1PEoMfjVZbGgB73vqgrs.jpg","vote_average":0.166,"vote_count":1,"width":500},{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":871,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/4gyMLPgfiEepuCnpNs5YjMiUlnU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":581}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2003-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":1},{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"en","note":"","release_date":"2005-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
