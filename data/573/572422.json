The extensive postproduction work on an Optical Printer has been completed in Germany, and the reknown German bass-musician Eberhard Weber made the wonderful soundtrack while watching the film. To me this film is like an elaborate tapestry woven by thousands of fade-ins and fade-outs. It feels like stepping into a river and getting carried along.\" Bastian Clevé","popularity":0.1066,"poster_path":"/DjVNtN30RDAnEKi6sn5zj4OlNl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"San Francisco Zephyr","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":69533,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bastian Clevé","original_name":"Bastian Clevé","popularity":0.0441,"profile_path":"/hjfWLMHXLlNohdTgSkkeJZaybKw.jpg","credit_id":"5c2d991ec3a3680835a01d3d","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0357130","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":750,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/DjVNtN30RDAnEKi6sn5zj4OlNl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":500}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"","release_date":"1978-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":3}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
