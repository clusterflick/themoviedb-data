The Comedia del Arte is deeply entrenched in the Italian mind. Jokes, misunderstandings... everything contributes to the general confusion. The poor become rich, the old become young. Pierrot turns into Columbine. Columbine turns into Pierrot. Everything is possible; everything permissible. A French family arrives in the middle of the farce. Julien, the young son, escaping his mother's clutches, joins in with the colourful spectacle. What does he seek? Love? Who knows? The actors are immersed in the fairytale. Don Juan sees Puss-in-Boots in Romeo; his friend Silvio is the traitor. The Baron Mosca, Romeo's uncle, leads the ball. Seeing the young French guy's attraction to his nephew, the dirty old baron sees an opportunity to wreck the imminent marriage of his nephew, an alliance which he loathes. Success for this Machiavelli when he throws an orgiastic party in his sumptuous palace!","popularity":0,"poster_path":"/q7sr60L3uV6HQUr9dy5NDwPLX3S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65668,"logo_path":"/qHpNaCy2IGoTdyQkI2eD972E7Va.png","name":"French
