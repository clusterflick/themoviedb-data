The universal event of pentecost is the moment of the highest realization: technologically, the moment of all possibilities, i.e. white noise and snow. The text spoken by a TV announcer tries to create a hierarchy, but it is constantly disturbed, subverted, and displaced by electronic image distortions and fade-ins and fade-outs of multilingual versions of the text and of signal terms in various alphabets. A work to be read with differentiation on truth, sublimity, and the media.","popularity":0.0143,"poster_path":"/cHjoGT0sbxOPtmzlbqrjyVNAG5D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pentecost","video":false,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2207807,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorothea Strauss","original_name":"Dorothea Strauss","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"cast_id":1,"character":"Voice","credit_id":"5c2e8de592514165a66db8a1","order":0}],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2207809,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heiner Goebbels","original_name":"Heiner Goebbels","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2e8f0ec3a3682913a62139","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2207811,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Norbert Meissner","original_name":"Norbert Meissner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2e8e580e0a2676033971a3","department":"Directing","job":"Director"},{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2207809,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Heiner Goebbels","original_name":"Heiner Goebbels","popularity":0.0214,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2e8e2b9251415f3c6cfa1c","department":"Sound","job":"Sound"},{"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2207811,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Norbert Meissner","original_name":"Norbert Meissner","popularity":0,"profile_path":null,"credit_id":"5c2e8e49c3a3682913a61f40","department":"Visual Effects","job":"Visual Effects"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":null,"wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.667,"height":1005,"iso_639_1":null,"file_path":"/cHjoGT0sbxOPtmzlbqrjyVNAG5D.jpg","vote_average":3.334,"vote_count":1,"width":670}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"de","note":"","release_date":"1989-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","type":5}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
