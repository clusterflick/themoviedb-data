The work is a spiritual portrait of a place and time. It is, as is Cabanas, willfully slow, meditative, passive. It has no evident narrative, though I hope I was able in my editing and other choices to impart a kind of slowly developing momentum which functions vaguely like a narrative, or like the melodic line in a piece of music. Finally LUZ is about light, and philosophically about life, and our place on this planet, and its place in the universe.","popularity":0.0281,"poster_path":"/pRol2E4zFcaQ673VM1LxfFXhv7T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Rays of Light of Ria Formosa","video":false,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"alternative_titles":{"titles":[]},"credits":{"cast":[],"crew":[{"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1012097,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jon Jost","original_name":"Jon Jost","popularity":0.0631,"profile_path":"/kYXBWSdUTTGcmJWwMefeZ3nPYmb.jpg","credit_id":"5c2cd81e0e0a2642d638e1f2","department":"Directing","job":"Director"}]},"external_ids":{"imdb_id":"tt0457685","wikidata_id":null,"facebook_id":null,"instagram_id":null,"twitter_id":null},"images":{"backdrops":[],"logos":[],"posters":[{"aspect_ratio":0.676,"height":814,"iso_639_1":"en","file_path":"/pRol2E4zFcaQ673VM1LxfFXhv7T.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"width":550}]},"keywords":{"keywords":[]},"release_dates":{"results":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","release_dates":[{"certification":"","descriptors":[],"iso_639_1":"","note":"International Film Festival Rotterdam","release_date":"1999-01-20T00:00:00.000Z","type":2}]}]},"videos":{"results":[]}}}
